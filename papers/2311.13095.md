# [Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models to Facilitate Legal   Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13095)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach to enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling their effective application in logic-intensive domains like law. RLLF mitigates issues with existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods which can incorporate biases and compromise reasoning skills. The RLLF framework uses both human judgments and logical feedback from engines like Prolog to train reward predictors, balancing user satisfaction and logical accuracy. This allows fine-tuning LLMs using reinforcement learning to optimize for factual correctness alongside user preferences. Various logical knowledge representations are explored that could provide feedback, analyzing dimensions like complexity, assumptions, and solution determination. Overall, RLLF offers a promising path to develop LLMs with robust logical reasoning proficiency, crucial for reliable performance in legal and similar settings with accuracy and reasoning requirements. The approach addresses present LLM limitations, opening avenues to extend their utility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach to improve the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models for legal applications by incorporating logical feedback in addition to human feedback during model training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach to improve the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) The paper identifies limitations of current Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods, including potential biases in human feedback that can lead to suboptimal training and reasoning capabilities for LLMs. 

2) To address these limitations, the paper proposes the RLLF framework which incorporates both human feedback and logical feedback from a reasoning engine to guide the reinforcement learning process. This aims to enhance logical reasoning skills while minimizing human biases.

3) The paper explores considerations around different logical representations that could be used to provide the logical feedback in RLLF. It discusses features like popularity, complexity, level, environment, assumptions, solution determination, and consistency of representations.

4) The paper argues RLLF is promising for improving logical reasoning, especially in logic-heavy domains like law, allowing the development of LLMs that balance user satisfaction and accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is the conceptualization and initial exploration of the RLLF approach for overcoming current limitations and better training logical reasoning in LLMs.
