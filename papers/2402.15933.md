# [Bridging the Gap between 2D and 3D Visual Question Answering: A Fusion   Approach for 3D VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15933)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 3D visual question answering (3D-VQA) is an emerging task that requires models to understand 3D scenes and answer questions about them. However, current 3D-VQA methods face challenges due to limited 3D data and lack generalization to novel visual concepts. 
- Existing methods that incorporate 2D information have limitations: using top-down 2D views introduces overly complex or incomplete visual clues, while relying on globally aggregated 2D features loses fine-grained 2D-3D correlations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes BridgeQA, a novel 3D-VQA approach that bridges 2D and 3D VQA via:
  - Question-conditional 2D view selection: Retrieves 2D views semantically related to the question to provide crucial visual clues.
  - A two-branch Transformer model: 
    - Retains a 2D vision-language model (VLM) branch to exploit 2D knowledge.
    - Has a 3D branch initialized from the 2D branch for alignment.
    - Employs a Twin-Transformer design that allows 2D and 3D tokens to augment each other via cross-attention.
- This compactly fuses 2D and 3D contexts while preserving 2D VLM knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes question-based 2D view selection to identify relevant 2D clues for 3D-VQA.
- Designs a two-branch Transformer architecture for seamless 2D and 3D fusion, featuring Twin-Transformer for fine-grained feature alignment. 
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on ScanQA and SQA benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior arts.
- Provides an efficient way to transfer 2D vision-language knowledge to enhance 3D understanding.

In summary, the paper makes significant advances in 3D-VQA by innovatively harnessing 2D knowledge to overcome 3D data scarcity challenges. The proposed BridgeQA model offers a fresh perspective on incorporating 2D-3D multi-modality for robust 3D scene understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel 3D visual question answering method called BridgeQA that selects question-relevant 2D views of 3D scenes and fuses 2D and 3D visual contexts through a Twin-Transformer architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) It presents a novel 2D-3D VQA approach called BridgeQA that uniquely bridges the gap between 2D and 3D VQA models. This addresses challenges like data scarcity and limited visual content diversity in current 3D VQA.

2) It innovates a question-conditional 2D view selection method to identify semantically relevant 2D inputs and provide a more nuanced understanding of the 3D visual content. 

3) It designs a two-branch Transformer model to efficiently fuse 2D and 3D inputs using a Twin-Transformer technique. This allows compact integration of the modalities while preserving pretrained 2D knowledge.

4) It evaluates the method on ScanQA and SQA datasets, significantly surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. This validates the efficacy of the approach for enhancing 3D VQA performance by accommodating both 2D and 3D visual contexts.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel 2D-3D VQA architecture called BridgeQA that can effectively transfer 2D vision-language knowledge into 3D VQA and align the modalities using question-conditional view selection and a Twin-Transformer structure. This leads to new state-of-the-art results on ScanQA and SQA datasets.
