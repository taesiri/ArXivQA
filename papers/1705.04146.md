# [Program Induction by Rationale Generation : Learning to Solve and   Explain Algebraic Word Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Solving math word problems requires translating the words into mathematical operations and executing them to get the answer. However, only getting the final numeric answer makes the solution process opaque. 
- To increase transparency, the paper proposes generating an "answer rationale" - a step-by-step natural language explanation justifying the answer through intermediate mathematical expressions. This makes the problem solving process interpretable.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper collects a new dataset of 100,000 math word problems with ground truth answers and human-written answer rationales.
- They propose a neural sequence-to-sequence model that jointly generates the rationale text and executes mathematical operations needed to derive the expressions in the rationale. 
- The model generates a latent "program" of mathematical operations alongside the text generation process. Executing this program leads to the expressions in the rationale and final answer.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of a large-scale dataset of 100,000 math word problems with answer rationales.
- A neural model that generates text and performs mathematical manipulations jointly through a latent program to output an interpretable step-by-step solution process.
- Demonstrating that answer rationales indirectly supervise the learning of arithmetic programs, leading to 2x higher accuracy compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach and dataset for math word problem solving focused on interpretability through answer rationales. The proposed model outperforms baselines by jointly generating text and programs.
