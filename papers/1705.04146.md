# [Program Induction by Rationale Generation : Learning to Solve and   Explain Algebraic Word Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Solving math word problems requires translating the words into mathematical operations and executing them to get the answer. However, only getting the final numeric answer makes the solution process opaque. 
- To increase transparency, the paper proposes generating an "answer rationale" - a step-by-step natural language explanation justifying the answer through intermediate mathematical expressions. This makes the problem solving process interpretable.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper collects a new dataset of 100,000 math word problems with ground truth answers and human-written answer rationales.
- They propose a neural sequence-to-sequence model that jointly generates the rationale text and executes mathematical operations needed to derive the expressions in the rationale. 
- The model generates a latent "program" of mathematical operations alongside the text generation process. Executing this program leads to the expressions in the rationale and final answer.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of a large-scale dataset of 100,000 math word problems with answer rationales.
- A neural model that generates text and performs mathematical manipulations jointly through a latent program to output an interpretable step-by-step solution process.
- Demonstrating that answer rationales indirectly supervise the learning of arithmetic programs, leading to 2x higher accuracy compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach and dataset for math word problem solving focused on interpretability through answer rationales. The proposed model outperforms baselines by jointly generating text and programs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a model that jointly generates natural language rationales and programs to solve algebraic word problems, trained on a new dataset of 100,000 question-answer-rationale triples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The creation of a new dataset with over 100,000 algebraic word problems, each annotated with answers and natural language rationales explaining the reasoning behind the answers. 

2. A proposed sequence-to-sequence model that can generate natural language rationales interspersed with mathematical expressions and operations, effectively modeling the step-by-step reasoning process behind solving algebraic word problems. 

3. A technique for inferring latent arithmetic programs to generate rationales and answers, using the rationales as a guide to constrain the search space. This allows the model to solve problems that would be intractable to solve directly without the rationales.

So in summary, the key innovation is using rationales to indirectly supervise the learning of programs for solving algebraic word problems, through the joint modeling of natural language generation and arithmetic operations. The new dataset and proposed neural sequence-to-sequence model are enabling contributions for this approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Algebraic word problems - The paper focuses on solving math word problems that involve algebra.

- Answer rationales - The main goal is to not only solve the word problems but also generate natural language rationales explaining the reasoning behind the answer.

- Program induction - The method involves jointly inducing arithmetic programs alongside the rationales that explain the programs. 

- Sequence-to-sequence model - The core of the model is a sequence-to-sequence architecture that generates both text and programs.

- Instruction sequences - The latent programs are represented as sequences of instructions that manipulate values when executed.

- Staged backpropagation - A training method is proposed to deal with long instruction sequences by splitting them into stages.

- Math dataset - A new dataset of 100,000 math word problems with answer rationales is introduced.

So in summary, key terms cover the task and dataset, the model architecture and training, the concept of answer rationales, and program induction through instruction sequences.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes generating "answer rationales" as an intermediate step to guide the model towards solving math word problems. What are some pros and cons of this indirect supervision approach compared to directly predicting the answer?

2. The set of mathematical operations handled by the instruction set seems quite limited. What challenges are involved in expanding this set, and how might it improve performance? 

3. The staged backpropagation method is introduced to deal with long sequences. How sensitive is overall performance to the slice size K? What factors determine the optimal setting?

4. What modifications could be made to the heuristic search procedure to handle more complex multi-step word problems? How might leveraging richer domain knowledge help guide the search?

5. Error analysis reveals the method struggles with complex problems. What are some ways the representational capacity could be improved to capture longer-range dependencies? 

6. The model seems to require the full set of multiple choice options as input. How reasonable is this assumption and what changes would be needed to relax it?

7. What other indirect supervisory signals beyond rationales could potentially be leveraged to guide learning of programs for math word problems?

8. How does the performance compare when beam search is used instead of selecting the single most probable program during decoding? What tradeoffs are involved?

9. The model does not explicitly reason about quantities and units. What mechanisms could be added to incorporate this physical/commonsense knowledge? 

10. The evaluation relies on perplexity and BLEU which may not perfectly correlate with question answering accuracy. What other evaluation metrics should be considered?
