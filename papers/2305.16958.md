# [MixCE: Training Autoregressive Language Models by Mixing Forward and   Reverse Cross-Entropies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16958)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to train autoregressive language models to generate more human-like text during open-ended generation. The hypothesis is that combining forward and reverse cross-entropy as a training objective will result in language models that produce higher quality and more diverse text compared to standard maximum likelihood estimation.

The key points are:

- Standard MLE training struggles to penalize bad or non-human-like generations from the model. It also tends to overgeneralize and cover noise in the training data.

- Reverse cross-entropy evaluates model generations by the human distribution, focusing on text quality. Forward cross-entropy ensures diversity. Combining them helps balance quality and diversity. 

- Approximating and optimizing the intractable reverse cross-entropy results in a self-reinforced objective that encourages high-confidence generations.

- Experiments show models trained with the proposed MixCE objective generate text more preferred by humans compared to MLE, without needing modified decoding methods.

In summary, the paper hypothesizes and provides evidence that optimizing a mixture of forward and reverse cross-entropy can improve language model training towards more human-like text generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new training objective called MixCE for autoregressive language models. The key ideas are:

- MixCE combines forward and reverse cross-entropy losses during training. Forward cross-entropy focuses on diversity of generations while reverse cross-entropy focuses more on quality. 

- MixCE approximates a mixture of forward and reverse KL divergences, which helps balance two complementary driving forces - reverse KL narrows down the model distribution when it is too broad while forward KL broadens the model distribution when too narrow.

- They derive an approximation for reverse cross-entropy that encourages the model to generate text it is already confident about. This acts like a self-reinforcing objective.  

- Experiments show MixCE improves over standard maximum likelihood estimation (which uses just forward cross-entropy) in both synthetic and real settings. Models trained with MixCE generate more human-like, higher quality text according to both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the MixCE objective to improve open-ended text generation from autoregressive language models by combining forward and reverse cross-entropy losses. The method is shown to generate better quality text without needing complex decoding strategies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new training objective called MixCE that mixes forward and reverse cross-entropy to improve the quality and diversity of text generated by autoregressive language models like GPT-2.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in improving text generation from autoregressive language models:

- The key novelty is in the MixCE objective function which combines forward and reverse cross-entropy. This provides complementary forces to fit the model distribution to the data distribution better. Other works have tried to go beyond maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for language models, but use different approaches like unlikelihood training, truncating high-loss examples, or approximating reverse cross-entropy in other ways.

- Compared to methods like unlikelihood training that target specific problems like repetition, MixCE takes a more general approach without needing to pre-define undesirable text phenomena. The effect emerges from balancing quality and diversity.

- MixCE has similarities to GAN training objectives in trying to match model and data distributions. But unlike GANs, MixCE can be optimized directly and efficiently like MLE, without requiring a min-max game or training a discriminator model.

- The results demonstrate MixCE's effectiveness empirically, showing gains over MLE baselines in metrics like coherence, diversity, and human evaluation. The gains are achieved by just changing the training objective, without relying on more complex decoding methods.

- One limitation compared to other work is that MixCE requires tuning the mixing coefficient η, while an automated way to set this hyperparameter would be preferred.

Overall, I would say the MixCE objective offers a simple but promising approach to improving text generation. The gains over MLE demonstrate the benefits of going beyond likelihood-based training for language models. The results are compelling on both automatic metrics and human evaluation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing methods to automatically determine the mixing ratio hyperparameter η instead of needing to tune it manually. As discussed in the Limitations section, finding the right value for η is challenging and can vary across datasets and settings. More work is needed on how to set η in a generalizable way, especially for pretraining scenarios where tuning on a dev set is infeasible.

- Applying MixCE to pretraining large language models, instead of just finetuning as done in the current work. The authors suggest MixCE could potentially help with pretraining, but more investigation is needed to confirm this.

- Further analyzing whether MixCE can help improve specific issues like factuality of generations and reducing biases, which were limitations raised by the authors. The current work focuses on coherence/fluency metrics, but model generations still likely contain false information and biases.

- Addressing the remaining language degeneration issues that MixCE does not fully solve, like repetition from greedy decoding. The current work shows improvements for sampling decoding but not greedy.

- Exploring other ways to approximate or optimize the intractable reverse cross-entropy besides the self-reinforced objective used here. There may be other techniques worth trying.

- Testing MixCE on other modalities beyond just text, such as image generation models. The overall idea could potentially transfer.

- Doing further analysis to understand exactly when and why MixCE makes the most difference compared to standard MLE training. This could help guide how best to apply MixCE in the future.

In summary, key next steps revolve around improving MixCE itself (e.g. setting η automatically), applying it more broadly (e.g. pretraining), and better understanding its strengths and limitations. The authors lay out a promising direction with MixCE, but more work remains to make it fully viable.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new training objective called MixCE for autoregressive language models like GPT-2. MixCE combines the normal forward cross-entropy loss (equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation) with an approximation of reverse cross-entropy. Reverse cross-entropy encourages the model to produce high likelihood text similar to human evaluations. Forward cross-entropy emphasizes diversity. Together these provide complementary training signals - reverse cross-entropy narrows the model distribution when it is too broad while forward cross-entropy broadens the model when it is too narrow. Experiments on synthetic and real data show MixCE helps the model generate higher quality text compared to standard MLE training, without needing complex decoding strategies like top-p sampling. The model generations have higher diversity, coherence and human preference compared to MLE models. Overall, MixCE provides a better model distribution for open-ended text generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new training objective called MixCE for autoregressive language models like GPT-2. MixCE combines forward and reverse cross-entropy during training. Forward cross-entropy, which is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation, encourages diversity in the model's generations. Reverse cross-entropy reflects how humans evaluate text - by sampling from the model and judging quality. So it focuses more on improving text quality. 

The authors show MixCE improves over standard maximum likelihood training in synthetic experiments where the true data distribution is known. In experiments on finetuning GPT-2 on three text datasets, MixCE produces generations that are more diverse, coherent, and preferred by humans compared to maximum likelihood training. The advantages are especially prominent when using unbiased sampling at test time rather than top-p sampling. Overall, MixCE provides a better trained model distribution that requires less post-hoc modification during decoding.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new training objective called MixCE for autoregressive language models like GPT-2. MixCE mixes the forward and reverse cross-entropies between the model distribution Qθ and the data distribution P. Forward cross-entropy, equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation, encourages diversity in the model generations. Reverse cross-entropy reflects human evaluation of sampling from the model and evaluating by the data distribution, emphasizing quality over diversity. Since reverse cross-entropy is intractable to optimize directly, the authors derive an approximation that encourages the model to produce generations it is already confident in. This approximated reverse cross-entropy is combined with forward cross-entropy in a mixture controlled by a hyperparameter η. Experiments show MixCE helps models generate higher quality text compared to standard maximum likelihood training, without needing complex decoding strategies.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of language degeneration and non-human-like text generation in large autoregressive language models like GPT-2. Specifically:

- When decoding via unbiased sampling, these models often produce incoherent or nonsensical text. 

- When decoding greedily, they can get stuck in repetitive loops.

The authors argue these issues suggest the learned model distribution Q_theta still differs substantially from the true human distribution P. They propose a new training objective called MixCE that mixes forward and reverse cross-entropy to obtain a better model distribution Q_theta and generate more human-like text without needing complex decoding strategies.

Some key points:

- Forward CE (equivalent to MLE) encourages diversity but only weakly penalizes bad generations not in P. 

- Reverse CE reflects human evaluation (sampling from model, judging by human) and focuses on quality.

- MixCE combines these complementary forces - reverse CE narrows Q_theta when too broad, forward CE broadens it when too narrow.

- They approximate reverse CE as a "self-reinforced" loss that promotes high-confidence generations.

- Experiments show MixCE improves diversity, quality metrics, and human rankings compared to MLE, without fancy decoding.

So in summary, the paper aims to improve open-ended text generation from LMs by better training the model distribution with a mixed CE objective.
