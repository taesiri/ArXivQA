# [LSK3DNet: Towards Effective and Efficient 3D Perception with Large   Sparse Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous systems like self-driving cars need to process large-scale, sparse, irregular 3D point clouds from LiDAR sensors. However, they have limited on-board compute resources. Therefore, it is important to develop LiDAR perception models that are both computationally efficient and achieve high performance on tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection. Simply enlarging 3D convolution kernels can improve performance but also substantially increases computational cost. Hence, efficient large 3D kernel designs are needed.

Method - LSK3DNet:
The paper proposes an efficient Large Sparse Kernel 3D Neural Network (LSK3DNet) with two key components:

1. Spatial-wise Dynamic Sparsity (SDS): Dynamically prunes and regrows weights within spatial groups of 3D conv kernels. This allows scaling up the kernel size while keeping model size and computations low. Helps learn better features.

2. Channel-wise Weight Selection (CWS): Expands model width during training by adding channels. Then selects most salient channels while pruning redundant ones. Improves performance without increasing model size.

Together SDS and CWS allow larger 3D kernels for better performance, while maintaining efficiency.

Contributions:

- Propose LSK3DNet that uses SDS to achieve large 3D kernels (up to 9x9x9) more efficiently.

- CWS widens model without parameter increase to boost performance. Overall, 40% smaller model and 60% lesser computations than naive large kernels.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art on SemanticKITTI segmentation (75.6% mIoU, single-scan) while being faster. Also shows gains over prior large 3D kernel methods on ScanNet and KITTI datasets.
