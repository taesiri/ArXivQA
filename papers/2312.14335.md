# [Context-aware Decoding Reduces Hallucination in Query-focused   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Query-focused summarization (QFS) aims to generate a summary from a document that is relevant to answering a given query. 
- Applying large language models (LLMs) to QFS can lead to hallucination, where the generated text contradicts the source document.
- There is interest in developing new decoding methods that can improve faithfulness in conditional text generation like QFS.

Method:
- The paper studies Context-Aware Decoding (CAD), a recently proposed decoding method that uses pointwise mutual information to make generation more conditioned on the input context. 
- CAD modifies the decoding distribution by multiplying the vanilla logit with a term that measures association between predicted token and input context.

Experiments:
- Experiments compare CAD to vanilla decoding over 8 LLMs on 2 QFS and 2 news summarization datasets.
- CAD reduces factual errors/hallucinations measured by FactKB while retaining lexical similarity measured by ROUGE.
- There is a tradeoff between factuality and abstractiveness when varying the CAD hyperparameter.
- CAD improves quality but with extra compute cost and slower decoding.

Contributions:
- Provides large-scale study on effectiveness of CAD for improving faithfulness in QFS task.
- Shows CAD reduces hallucinations while maintaining level of abstraction.
- Analyzes computational overhead and sensitivity to hyperparameters of CAD.
- Implementation based on HuggingFace Transformers is open-sourced.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper conducts experiments with eight language models to show that context-aware decoding, a recently proposed decoding method, can improve query-focused summarization and news summarization quality by reducing factual errors while retaining lexical pattern match, but also introduces additional computational complexity and slower decoding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1) Conducting a large-scale reproducibility study on the recently proposed Context-aware Decoding (CAD) method for improving query-focused summarization and reducing hallucination.

2) Evaluating CAD not just on news summarization datasets as in the original paper, but also on query-focused summarization datasets to analyze its effectiveness for that application.

3) Including more rigorous analysis on computational complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, etc. compared to the original CAD paper.

4) Testing CAD with 8 different language models, including both pre-trained and instruction-finetuned models, to analyze how architectural and training choices impact CAD's performance.

5) Releasing an open-source implementation of CAD based on HuggingFace to facilitate future research.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be a much more thorough evaluation and analysis of Context-aware Decoding for query-focused summarization across different models and datasets compared to what was done previously. The findings provide guidance on how effective CAD is and in what areas future work could aim to improve it.

The paper focuses on query-focused summarization, which aims to provide a summary satisfying an information need specified by a query. It studies a decoding method called context-aware decoding (CAD) that helps reduce hallucination errors from large language models. The key ideas explored are leveraging pointwise mutual information to condition the generation on context, analyzing the computational tradeoffs of CAD, and experimentally validating its effectiveness on summarization and question answering datasets. Overall, it examines CAD's ability to balance relevance (ROUGE scores) and factuality (FactKB metric).


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the context-aware decoding method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper shows that context-aware decoding improves performance on news summarization datasets but not on all query-focused summarization datasets. Why might this be the case? Does it suggest any limitations in the applicability of this method?

2. The paper examines the effect of the hyperparameter α which controls the weighting of the pointwise mutual information term. What is the sensitivity of the method's performance to different settings of α? Is there an optimal value?

3. The paper analyzes the additional computational complexity introduced by computing the extra forward pass. How much does this actually slow down inference in practice and does it limit the applicability for real-time systems? 

4. Could the ideas from context-aware decoding be combined with other methods like contrastive decoding that also aim to improve faithfulness? What challenges might this combination present?

5. The design of the prompting template seems very important for context-aware decoding. What impact do different prompt designs have on the effectiveness of this method?

6. Context-aware decoding requires computing an extra forward pass without the context. Does the choice of this "no context" input matter significantly? Should it be randomized?

7. For query-focused summarization, should the query alone be provided in the "no context" input or should it be omitted entirely? What are the tradeoffs?

8. The paper focuses on standard conditional language models. Could context-aware decoding also improve faithfulness for retrieval augmented generation models? Why or why not?

9. The paper shows reduced decoding speed due to the extra computation. Are there optimizations or model architectures that could help address this?

10. How does the effectiveness of context-aware decoding compare or relate to other methods likeRetrieval Augmented Generation in reducing hallucination for conditional text generation?
