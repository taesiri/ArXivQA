# [ENVIDR: Implicit Differentiable Renderer with Neural Environment   Lighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13022)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we achieve high-quality rendering and reconstruction of glossy surfaces from multiview images using neural rendering techniques?Specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of prior neural rendering methods in accurately modeling surfaces with challenging specular reflections and inter-reflections. It proposes a novel framework called ENVIDR that has the following key goals:1) Improve rendering quality of glossy surfaces compared to state-of-the-art neural rendering models. 2) Achieve more accurate surface geometry reconstruction than methods that may inaccurately model virtual geometry for complex reflections.3) Retain the ability to edit scenes (e.g. relighting) by decomposing rendering components like material properties and environment lighting. 4) Model inter-reflections to handle view-dependent indirect illumination on shiny surfaces.The central hypothesis is that by designing a neural renderer to approximate physically based rendering with decomposed components, and integrating it with a neural surface representation, the proposed ENVIDR model can achieve these goals and effectively render high-quality views of glossy surfaces from limited input views. The experiments aim to demonstrate that ENVIDR performs equal or better than previous state-of-the-art across different metrics, while enabling scene editing capabilities.In summary, the key research question is around developing a neural rendering approach specialized for high fidelity modeling of specular and glossy surfaces, which addresses limitations in prior work. The paper aims to show ENVIDR is an effective solution through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
