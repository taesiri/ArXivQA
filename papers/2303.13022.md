# [ENVIDR: Implicit Differentiable Renderer with Neural Environment   Lighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13022)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we achieve high-quality rendering and reconstruction of glossy surfaces from multiview images using neural rendering techniques?

Specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of prior neural rendering methods in accurately modeling surfaces with challenging specular reflections and inter-reflections. It proposes a novel framework called ENVIDR that has the following key goals:

1) Improve rendering quality of glossy surfaces compared to state-of-the-art neural rendering models. 

2) Achieve more accurate surface geometry reconstruction than methods that may inaccurately model virtual geometry for complex reflections.

3) Retain the ability to edit scenes (e.g. relighting) by decomposing rendering components like material properties and environment lighting. 

4) Model inter-reflections to handle view-dependent indirect illumination on shiny surfaces.

The central hypothesis is that by designing a neural renderer to approximate physically based rendering with decomposed components, and integrating it with a neural surface representation, the proposed ENVIDR model can achieve these goals and effectively render high-quality views of glossy surfaces from limited input views. The experiments aim to demonstrate that ENVIDR performs equal or better than previous state-of-the-art across different metrics, while enabling scene editing capabilities.

In summary, the key research question is around developing a neural rendering approach specialized for high fidelity modeling of specular and glossy surfaces, which addresses limitations in prior work. The paper aims to show ENVIDR is an effective solution through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) A novel neural renderer that learns to approximate physically based rendering using decomposed MLPs for environment lighting, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This allows modeling complex rendering effects without needing an explicit analytical rendering equation.

2) A neural surface modeling framework called ENVIDR that employs the proposed neural renderer. By using the pre-trained diffuse and specular MLPs from the renderer, ENVIDR can represent scenes with improved rendering quality and surface geometry compared to prior work. It also enables controllable scene relighting and material editing.

3) A technique to model inter-reflections and indirect illumination by ray marching surface-reflected rays. A learned blending factor is used to combine the direct and indirect lighting. This improves rendering of glossy surfaces.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a neural renderer to approximate physical shading and using it within a neural scene representation. This approach achieves high quality rendering of challenging materials like glossy surfaces, while retaining control over lighting and materials for editing. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on rendering quality and scene decomposition compared to previous methods.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to related work:

- The paper focuses on improving neural rendering quality and surface reconstruction for objects with challenging glossy/specular surfaces. This remains an open challenge that prior neural rendering methods struggle with.

- Compared to view synthesis methods like NeRF variants, this paper achieves comparable or higher rendering quality while reconstructing more accurate surface geometry. Many view synthesis methods tend to learn incorrect geometry to account for complex reflections. 

- Compared to neural inverse rendering methods, this paper achieves significantly higher rendering quality by using a novel neural renderer. Prior inverse rendering methods rely on simplified rendering equations and have lower quality.

- The proposed method also enables controllable scene editing such as relighting and material editing. This level of editability is not supported by view synthesis methods like NeRF. Prior inverse rendering methods also have limited editability.

- The key differences of this paper seem to be: 1) The proposed neural renderer that approximates physical rendering without an explicit equation, 2) Use of a neural surface representation, and 3) Modeling of inter-reflections.

- Overall, the paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in reconstructing and rendering glossy surfaces, with results better than or comparable to recent view synthesis and inverse rendering techniques, while also enabling scene editing capabilities lacking in other methods.

In summary, the paper presents substantial improvements over prior work by combining the advantages of high rendering quality and editability. The novel neural renderer and the way it interfaces with the surface representation appear to be the main contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Incorporating geometry-based visibility approximations to handle shadowing effects. The pre-integrated representation of environment lighting used in their model assumes full visibility and can result in lower quality for shaded regions. Recent works have proposed visibility approximations that could be integrated.

- Achieving more fine-grained decomposition of rendering parameters like material properties. Their model focuses on decomposition into diffuse color, specular color, roughness and environment lighting, but does not fully separate all rendering properties. Further decomposition could enable greater editability.

- Extending the approach to handle semi-transparent materials and unbounded/open scenes. The current method is designed for rendering opaque, closed objects. Adapting it for transparency and open spaces is noted as an area for future work.

- Improving the support for indirect illumination, which currently is limited to low-roughness surfaces. A more general solution for indirect lighting that handles glossy surfaces better could improve rendering quality. 

- Incorporating more complex analytic BRDF models beyond diffuse and specular terms. The paper notes anisotropic effects and refraction as directions left for future exploration.

- Further optimization for faster training and rendering. While recent work has sped up NeRF methods, more improvements to efficiency could make the approach more practical.

In summary, the authors suggest enhancements in areas like visibility and global illumination, material decomposition, transparency/open scenes, efficiency etc. to address limitations and push the boundaries of their approach. Expanding the scope and applicability of their rendering and modeling framework is a key direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ENVIDR, a framework for high-quality rendering and reconstruction of shiny surfaces from multiview images. It uses a novel neural renderer with decomposed MLPs for environment lighting, diffuse shading, and specular shading that approximates physically based rendering without an explicit formulation. This is combined with an SDF-based neural surface representation of the scene geometry. To handle inter-reflections on shiny surfaces, ENVIDR additionally marches rays along surface-reflected directions and blends the resulting indirect illumination into the final rendering using a predicted blending factor. Experiments demonstrate ENVIDR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging real and synthetic scenes with glossy reflections. It also enables controllable editing such as material and scene relighting by swapping components of the decomposed neural renderer. A key benefit is the ability to achieve high rendering quality comparable to NeRF while also reconstructing accurate surface geometry and remaining editable.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a popular method for modeling and rendering 3D scenes with photo-realistic quality. However, NeRF models often struggle to accurately represent glossy surfaces with high specular reflectance. In this paper, the authors aim to achieve high-quality rendering and surface reconstruction for shiny objects. 

They propose ENVIDR, an implicit neural model that decouples the environment light representation from the neural scene representation. This enables high rendering quality, accurate surface geometry, and flexible scene relighting. The key ideas are: 1) Using a renderer with a neural approximation of the physically based rendering equation, 2) Additionally synthesizing the one-bounce inter-reflection from glossy surfaces, and 3) Representing the environment light with an MLP conditioned on light direction and material roughness, allowing for scene relighting by simply replacing this MLP. Experiments demonstrate ENVIDR outperforms prior methods on challenging shiny scenes by providing high-quality rendering of view-dependent specular reflections while also enabling material editing and physically based scene editing.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel neural rendering and modeling framework to improve the reconstruction and rendering quality of glossy surfaces. By learning to approximate physical rendering and representing scene components in a decomposed manner, the proposed ENVIDR model achieves state-of-the-art results in representing shiny objects while also enabling controllable editing of materials and lighting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces ENVIDR, a new rendering and modeling framework for high-quality reconstruction and rendering of surfaces with challenging specular reflections. The method has two main components: 1) a novel neural renderer that learns an approximation of physically based rendering using decomposed MLPs for environment lighting, diffuse rendering, and specular rendering, and 2) an SDF-based neural surface model that leverages the learned neural renderer. The neural renderer is trained using images synthesized by existing PBR renderers, keeping the diffuse and specular MLPs frozen during training on new scenes. The SDF model is optimized to represent the geometry and lighting of general scenes. To model inter-reflections, ENVIDR marches additional rays along surface-reflected directions and blends the indirect illumination into the final rendering using a predicted blending factor. This approach achieves high-quality rendering of glossy surfaces while retaining accurate surface geometry and enabling scene editing capabilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the challenge of accurately representing and rendering glossy surfaces with neural rendering methods like NeRF. Specifically, it aims to improve upon two key limitations:

1) Existing methods that achieve top rendering quality often learn inaccurate geometry and virtual lights to account for complex view-dependent effects on glossy surfaces. This makes editing the scene lighting difficult. 

2) Methods that allow scene editing through inverse rendering decomposition tend to have lower rendering quality compared to top methods without decomposition. They rely on simplified rendering equations that cannot capture all effects.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes a new modeling framework called ENVIDR that comprises:

- A novel neural renderer that approximates physically based rendering using decomposed MLPs, without an explicit rendering equation. This allows capturing complex effects while enabling editing.

- An SDF-based neural surface model that interacts with this renderer to represent scenes. It constrains the surface geometry while leveraging the renderer's decomposition.

- A ray marching technique to approximate inter-reflections and blend them for high-quality rendering of glossy surfaces.

Overall, ENVIDR demonstrates improved rendering quality on par with state-of-the-art methods, while enabling scene editing thanks to the decomposition. It aims to push the boundaries of trade-offs between quality, geometry, and editability for neural rendering of glossy surfaces.
