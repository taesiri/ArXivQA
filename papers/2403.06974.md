# [Memory-based Adapters for Online 3D Scene Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
Existing 3D scene perception methods are either designed for offline settings, where a full 3D reconstruction of the scene is provided as input, or for single-view perception on individual frames. However, in many robotics applications like navigation and manipulation, the input is a streaming RGB-D video where data is collected and scene perception needs to be performed simultaneously in an online manner over the video frames. Hence, there is a need for online 3D scene perception methods that can effectively model the temporal relations across video frames.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a general framework to empower existing offline 3D perception models for online setting by adding plug-and-play memory-based adapters. Specifically, they introduce:

1) Point cloud adapter: Caches point cloud features extracted by the backbone in a queued voxel grid memory over time. It then enhances current frame features using a 3D convolutional network over the neighbor voxel features from memory.

2) Image adapter: Stores a proportion of channels from current image features into memory, replaces those channels with previous memory, and refines with 2D conv. 

3) 3D-to-2D adapter: Projects 3D memory to 2D space to provide global context and refine image features.

The adapters can be inserted into common offline architectures like MinkowskiNet, FCAF3D, TD3D etc. and finetuned on RGB-D videos to achieve online temporal modeling.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to empower offline 3D perception models for online setting using modular memory-based adapters
- Point cloud and image adapters to effectively aggregate intra- and inter-modal temporal relations 
- State-of-the-art online performance on semantic segmentation, detection and instance segmentation tasks on ScanNet and SceneNN datasets

The adapters are model-agnostic and bring significant gains over single-view models and offline models adapted for online setting. Hence, this is a valuable contribution towards online 3D perception for robotics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a general framework for online 3D scene perception by inserting memory-based adapters into existing offline models to empower them with temporal modeling ability for streaming RGB-D video inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work include:

1. Proposing a new general framework for online 3D scene perception. The framework extends existing offline models to online ones by simply inserting plug-and-play memory-based adapters and finetuning, without needing model or task-specific designs.

2. Proposing general memory-based adapters for both image and point cloud backbones to cache and aggregate extracted features over time to model temporal relations between frames.

3. Showing that by equipping offline models with the proposed adapters, the models achieve state-of-the-art performance on three online 3D scene perception tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation) compared to other online methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a general framework to empower offline 3D perception models with online perception ability using memory-based adapters, enabling strong performance on multiple online scene perception tasks with easy insertion and finetuning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Online 3D scene perception - The paper focuses on perceiving 3D scenes from streaming RGB-D video in an online manner rather than offline methods that require a full pre-reconstructed 3D scene.

- Memory-based adapters - The core contribution is a set of plug-and-play memory-based adapter modules that can empower offline models with online temporal modeling abilities.

- Temporal modeling/learning - The adapters exploit temporal information across frames of streaming data to enhance per-frame perceptions.

- Multimodal fusion - The approach fuses both image and 3D point cloud features/information using the proposed adapters. 

- Semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation - The approach is evaluated on enhancing offline models for these three core 3D scene perception tasks.

- RGB-D streaming video - The input data is posed RGB-D video streams rather than pre-collected and reconstructed 3D scene geometry.

- Adapter modules, residual connections, channel shift - Some key technical ideas/components of the proposed memory-based adapters.

In summary, the key focus is on online 3D scene perception from streaming RGB-D video using plug-and-play memory-based adapters to exploit multimodal temporal relations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions constructing a memory to cache image and point cloud features over time. What are the key benefits of using separate memories for the two modalities versus having one combined memory? How does this impact temporal modeling capability?

2. The point cloud memory utilizes voxel grids and sparse convolution while the image memory uses channel shift. What are the motivations behind choosing these different mechanisms for the two modalities? How do they complement each other? 

3. The paper proposes a 3D-to-2D adapter to enhance the image features using projections from the 3D point cloud memory. What is the intuition behind this? How does it help mitigate the limited global context in the image memory?

4. The adapters are inserted between backbones and prediction heads. What would be the tradeoffs of inserting them at other locations instead? How does insertion location impact what the adapters can learn?

5. The adapters are initialized to zero so finetuning starts smoothly from original model weights. What problems could random initialization cause? Could pre-trained adapters be beneficial?

6. The paper uses max pooling to update point cloud memory features over time. What are other options for temporal feature aggregation? What are their computational and accuracy tradeoffs?

7. What mechanisms allow the method to handle variable length input sequences and incomplete scenes? How robust is performance across different sequence configurations? 

8. The fusion strategies for combining per-frame predictions are quite simple. What are more advanced options and how could they further boost performance? What are their limitations?

9. How does the method balance exploiting temporal information with handling concept drift over long sequences? Could the memories be expanded to store more historical states?

10. The adapters empower offline models for online use. What modifications would be needed to train an end-to-end model? Would this be better than adapter-based finetuning of offline models?
