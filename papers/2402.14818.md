# [PALO: A Polyglot Large Multimodal Model for 5B People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large multimodal models like LLaVA and MobileVLM focus predominantly on English, lacking capabilities for non-English languages. This limits accessibility for billions of non-English speakers globally.

- There is a shortage of high-quality multilingual multimodal data to train such models compared to English. Translating English datasets to other languages is challenging and can introduce linguistic inaccuracies if not done carefully.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces PALO, the first open-source Large Multimodal Model covering 10 major languages - English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, French, Arabic, Bengali, Russian, Urdu and Japanese. 

- A semi-automated translation pipeline is developed to adapt an English multimodal instruction dataset into the 10 languages using a fine-tuned Large Language Model. This ensures linguistic fidelity while enabling scalability.

- Refinements by native speakers address language-specific issues in translations - punctuation, grammar, gender accuracy etc. Further fine-tuning improves translation quality.

- PALO models the visual content and user text query in 10 languages to generate relevant responses, enhancing understanding and generation for underrepresented languages.

Main Contributions:
- First open-source Large Multimodal Model for 10 languages covering 65% of global population, improving accessibility.

- High-quality dataset in 10 languages created through refined translation process - crucial for training linguistic precision.

- Models at 1.7B, 7B and 13B parameters demonstrate scalability. Substantial performance gains in low-resource languages without compromising high-resource languages.

- Multilingual benchmark introduced for evaluating language and vision reasoning across diverse languages. Advancement towards more inclusive AI systems.

In summary, the paper makes significant progress in expanding multimodal capabilities to multiple languages through careful translation, evaluation and modeling, helping serve billions of non-English speakers globally.
