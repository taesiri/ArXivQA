# [MimicDiffusion: Purifying Adversarial Perturbation via Mimicking Clean   Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04802)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new defense method called MimicDiffusion that purifies adversarial images by mimicking the generative process of diffusion models using clean images as input. It argues that adversarial perturbations negatively impact existing diffusion-based purification methods. To address this, MimicDiffusion uses Manhattan distance and separate guidance terms for long-range and short-range distances between the generated and adversarial images. The long-range guidance can directly leverage the adversarial image, while the short-range guidance uses a super-resolution operation to increase the distance. By mimicking clean image generation, MimicDiffusion reduces the impact of perturbations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with classifiers like WideResNet and ResNet50 show state-of-the-art performance against attacks like AutoAttack. For example, on CIFAR-10 with WideResNet-28-10, MimicDiffusion improves average robust accuracy by 18.49% over prior art. The results demonstrate that mimicking the clean image generative process is an effective approach for adversarial purification using diffusion models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MimicDiffusion, a new diffusion-based adversarial purification technique that directly approximates the generative process of the diffusion model with clean images as input to reduce the negative influence of adversarial perturbations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new perspective for diffusion-based adversarial purification methods, which mimic the generative process of the diffusion model with the clean image as input to reduce the negative influence of adversarial perturbation.

2. Proposing a novel MimicDiffusion method, where Manhattan distance and long-range guidance and short-range guidance are used to bridge the gap between the clean sample and the adversarial sample. 

3. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various adaptive attack benchmarks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing the MimicDiffusion method to purify adversarial examples by mimicking the diffusion model's behavior on clean images, and showing its state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets against adaptive attacks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes using Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean distance when calculating the guidance term. Why is Manhattan distance better suited for this application? What are the mathematical reasons behind this choice?

2) The paper divides the guidance term into "long-range" and "short-range" cases. Explain the difference between these two cases and why they need to be handled differently. 

3) Explain the proposed super-resolution operation for the short-range guidance term. How does this operation help convert short-range cases into long-range cases? What is the mathematical justification?

4) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a sampling strategy during the reverse diffusion process? Explain the rationale behind only applying guidance during a portion of the reverse steps.

5) How does the proposed method theoretically eliminate the impact of adversarial perturbations? Walk through the mathematical derivations step-by-step. 

6) The method leverages properties of diffusion models. Explain what attributes make diffusion models amenable for this application. How does the method take advantage of these attributes?

7) The experiments compare several threat models such as l_inf and l_2 norms. Why is the method effective across these different threat models? Does it handle some better than others?

8) How does the method balance keeping semantic label information while removing adversarial noise? Explain this trade-off.

9) The method outperforms prior purification techniques by a significant margin. Analyze the results and explain why the performance gains are so substantial.

10) The paper focuses on image data. Do you think the approach can generalize to other data types? What alterations would need to be made?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations are added to images that can fool the networks. 
- Diffusion-based adversarial purification methods aim to purify such perturbations by using diffusion models to generate clean images. However, the generative process of diffusion models is still affected by adversarial perturbations since the inputs contain such perturbations.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes MimicDiffusion, a new diffusion-based purification technique that directly approximates the generative process of the diffusion model with clean images as inputs. 
- It analyzes the differences in guided terms when using clean vs adversarial inputs, showing adversarial perturbations affect gradients.
- It uses Manhattan distance and separates cases into long-range (gradients are equal) and short-range (unknown relation between gradients).
- For long-range, it simply uses the adversarial sample since gradients are equal. For short-range, it projects images into a higher dimensional space to increase the distance.
- It also proposes a sampling strategy to implement guidance only during a particular time interval.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new perspective to mimic the generative process of diffusion models on clean inputs to reduce impact of perturbations.
- Introduces MimicDiffusion using Manhattan distance and long/short range guidance to bridge the gap between clean and adversarial inputs.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, improving average robust accuracy by 13-20% over baselines.
- Reduces the gap between standard and robust accuracy, showcasing ability to mimic clean diffusion trajectories.

In summary, the paper provides a novel way to approximate clean diffusion model trajectories to defend against adversarial attacks, demonstrating significant improvements over prior purification methods. The key insight is mimicking the generative process using clean inputs can mitigate the impact of perturbations.
