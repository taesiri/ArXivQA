# [MimicDiffusion: Purifying Adversarial Perturbation via Mimicking Clean   Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04802)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new defense method called MimicDiffusion that purifies adversarial images by mimicking the generative process of diffusion models using clean images as input. It argues that adversarial perturbations negatively impact existing diffusion-based purification methods. To address this, MimicDiffusion uses Manhattan distance and separate guidance terms for long-range and short-range distances between the generated and adversarial images. The long-range guidance can directly leverage the adversarial image, while the short-range guidance uses a super-resolution operation to increase the distance. By mimicking clean image generation, MimicDiffusion reduces the impact of perturbations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with classifiers like WideResNet and ResNet50 show state-of-the-art performance against attacks like AutoAttack. For example, on CIFAR-10 with WideResNet-28-10, MimicDiffusion improves average robust accuracy by 18.49% over prior art. The results demonstrate that mimicking the clean image generative process is an effective approach for adversarial purification using diffusion models.
