# [Towards Generalizable Tumor Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19470)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training AI models for tumor detection/segmentation requires large annotated datasets across multiple organs and hospitals. But obtaining such extensive multi-organ, multi-hospital annotations is extremely challenging. 

- Prior works on tumor synthesis are limited as they require designing organ/tumor-specific algorithms, cannot generalize across organs, and the resulting AI models fail to detect real tumors across hospitals.

Key Observation:
- The paper makes a key observation - early-stage tumors (<2cm) have similar imaging characteristics across various organs (liver, pancreas, kidneys) in CT scans.  

Proposed Solution - DiffTumor Framework
- Leverages the above observation to develop a 3-stage generative framework called DiffTumor for generalizable tumor synthesis

Stage 1) Trains Autoencoder on 9K+ CT volumes to learn latent features 

Stage 2) Trains Diffusion Model using liver tumor masks and latent features to generate synthetic latent features conditioned on arbitrary tumor masks

Stage 3) Trains Segmentation Model using synthetic tumors, reconstructed from latent features, achieving superior detection of real tumors

Main Contributions:

1) Shows DiffTumor can create realistic tumors generalizable across organs even when trained on just liver tumors leading to +10.7% DSC for tumor segmentation.

2) Demonstrates DiffTumor's tumor detection generalizability across hospitals through improved sensitivity (+28.6%) and DSC (+9.1%) on real pancreatic tumors from diverse demographics/hospitals.

In summary, DiffTumor framework enables highly generalizable tumor synthesis using minimal annotation for diffusion model (even 1 tumor), fast 100ms/tumor generation, and significantly boosts early tumor detection sensitivity. The key insight on early-stage tumor similarity combined with the proposed generative pipeline leads to state-of-the-art generalizability.
