# [Using Large Language Models for Knowledge Engineering (LLMKE): A Case   Study on Wikidata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08491)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The paper does not explicitly state a central research question or hypothesis. However, based on my reading, the main focus of the paper seems to be exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge engineering tasks, particularly for completing knowledge bases like Wikidata. 

The authors develop a method called LLMKE to leverage LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to predict objects for Wikidata statements given the subject and relation. Their goal seems to be assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs for automatic knowledge base completion and correction.

While not framed as an explicit research question, the underlying inquiry seems to be: How well can LLMs perform at completing knowledge bases like Wikidata? Can they be used to effectively augment human knowledge engineering? The authors test their method on relations from Wikidata and report performance across different domains. Their results suggest LLMs can be useful for KB completion in certain contexts but further experimentation is needed.

In summary, the central focus is evaluating LLMs on knowledge engineering tasks to determine their potential to improve the efficiency of constructing and revising knowledge bases compared to purely manual human efforts. The paper explores this through an empirical analysis on Wikidata statement completion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- The authors propose an approach called LLMKE for using large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge engineering tasks, with a focus on the ISWC 2023 LM-KBC Challenge involving Wikidata entity prediction.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 for knowledge engineering tasks on Wikidata, achieving promising results on object prediction for subject-relation pairs. The best method combines knowledge probing of LLMs with entity disambiguation, yielding a macro F1 score of 0.701 across relations. The authors find LLMs can complete knowledge bases effectively in some domains but face limitations, indicating their potential to assist human knowledge engineering rather than fully automate it currently.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on using large language models for knowledge base completion:

- This paper focuses specifically on using LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for completing knowledge in Wikidata, while much prior work has looked at knowledge probing in LLMs more generally. The focus on Wikidata makes the research more applied.

- The approach maps extracted knowledge to Wikidata entities, going beyond just extracting string knowledge. Linking predictions to KG entities makes the output more directly usable. 

- The paper analyzes performance across different relation types in Wikidata. It finds significant variability, with LLMs excelling on some relations like PersonHasNobelPrize but struggling on others like PersonHasEmployer. This highlights the importance of analyzing where LLMs succeed or fail.

- Retrieval augmentation is used to provide relevant context from sources like Wikipedia. This technique is commonly used to enhance LLMs, though the authors find it helps less with GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5.

- Disambiguation methods are implemented to link extracted strings to the correct entities. This addresses an important challenge in using LLMs for clean KG completion.

- The authors discuss gaps between knowledge in Wikidata vs Wikipedia and between different LLMs. Analyzing these knowledge gaps is an interesting direction for future research.

Overall, the analysis on a specific dataset (Wikidata), focus on linking predictions to KG entities, examination of performance by relation type, and use of disambiguation methods make this a nicely done applied study on utilizing LLMs for knowledge base completion. It builds nicely on prior knowledge probing work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Further investigate the knowledge gaps between different LLMs. The authors found that different LLMs can contain different knowledge, so using an ensemble of multiple LLMs with complementary strengths could improve performance.

- Explore techniques to align the knowledge contained in Wikidata with Wikipedia and use Wikipedia articles as context to complete triples in Wikidata. This could help address the knowledge gap between Wikidata and Wikipedia.

- Use the performance of LLMs on predicting objects for relations as a metric to identify incomplete Wikidata entities. Entities where LLMs struggle could be flagged for review by human editors.

- Have LLMs suggest new labels and aliases for Wikidata entities to enrich their representations. This could improve disambiguation by providing more search keywords.

- Experiment with having LLMs support human editors in making suggestions to improve Wikidata, such as for missing elements, incorrect values, etc. This could make knowledge engineering more efficient.

- Further analyze the reasoning abilities of LLMs and their limitations in logical constraints compared to knowledge graphs. Additional research is needed to determine if and how LLMs could be used for certain kinds of logical reasoning.

- Explore techniques for addressing the "deep" disambiguation errors made by LLMs where different aliases are predicted. This could expand the usefulness of LLMs for disambiguating entities.

- Evaluate the use of LLM ensembles and human-LLM collaboration for knowledge base construction across more domains. More research is needed to understand where LLMs are most useful.

In summary, the authors propose several interesting directions around improving LLM knowledge, exploiting complementarity across models, aligning LLM knowledge with KGs, using LLM predictions to improve KGs, and combining LLMs with human editors.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper describes an approach called LLMKE to using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for knowledge engineering tasks, specifically for completing knowledge triples sourced from Wikidata as part of the ISWC 2023 LM-KBC Challenge. The authors developed a pipeline with two main steps - knowledge probing using question prompts, triple completion prompts, and retrieval-augmented context to elicit knowledge from the LLMs, and Wikidata entity mapping to link the predicted string objects to their respective entities. Their best method achieved a macro F1 score of 0.701 across the properties, with scores ranging from 1.0 to 0.328, showing that the knowledge and capabilities of LLMs varies significantly by domain. The results demonstrate the potential of LLMs for knowledge base completion and correction when used appropriately, but also show gaps that indicate fully automatic knowledge engineering is not yet feasible and human involvement is still needed. Differences between Wikipedia and Wikidata knowledge also highlight issues LLMs may help address. Overall, the paper provides useful analysis about prospects of LLMs for assisting collaborative knowledge engineering.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper describes an approach called LLMKE for using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 for knowledge engineering tasks, specifically for completing knowledge triples sourced from Wikidata. The LLMKE pipeline has two main steps - knowledge probing using prompt engineering to elicit facts from the LLMs, and Wikidata entity mapping to link the extracted strings to their respective entities. The authors experiment with different prompt formats like questions, incomplete triples and retrieval-augmented context. Their best model, GPT-4 with retrieval-augmented context, achieved a macro average F1 score of 0.701 on predicting objects for Wikidata relations, with scores ranging from 1.0 to 0.328 across relations. The results show LLMs have varying suitability for knowledge base completion depending on the domain, and can contribute to improving efficiency and quality of collaborative knowledge engineering, though fully automated completion is not feasible currently. 

The authors also discuss challenges like knowledge gaps between Wikipedia and Wikidata, and limitations of Wikidata in terms of quality and completeness. They propose using LLMs to align Wikidata and Wikipedia, suggest edits based on LLM predictions, and enrich Wikidata aliases. The variability in LLM knowledge across domains necessitates further analysis, and ensembling multiple complementary LLM models can also improve performance. Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of LLMs for knowledge engineering when used appropriately, while highlighting the need for human involvement.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper describes an approach called LLMKE for using Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform knowledge engineering tasks, specifically for the ISWC 2023 LM-KBC Challenge on Wikidata object prediction. 

The main method involves a two-step pipeline of knowledge probing and Wikidata entity mapping. For knowledge probing, they engineer prompt templates to query the LLMs gpt-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 using question prompts, triple completion prompts, and retrieval-augmented context prompts. For entity mapping, they link the predicted string objects to Wikidata entities using label search and disambiguation methods like case-based, keyword-based, and LM-based. 

By combining knowledge probing of LLMs with Wikidata entity mapping, their best method achieves a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.701 across the 21 Wikidata relations in the challenge dataset. The results demonstrate the potential of LLMs for knowledge base completion but also reveal variations in LLM knowledge across domains that necessitate further research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step pipeline for knowledge graph completion using LLMs: knowledge probing and Wikidata entity mapping. Why was this two-step approach chosen instead of trying to map predictions directly to entities in one step? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the two-step method?

2. In the knowledge probing step, the authors experiment with question prompting, triple completion prompting, and retrieval-augmented context settings. What are the key differences between these approaches and why might one work better than others for different relations? How does providing relevant context improve performance?

3. For the Wikidata entity mapping, both a baseline and 3 improved disambiguation methods are proposed. Can you explain in more detail how the case-based, keyword-based, and LM-based disambiguation methods work? What are their limitations?

4. The results show variable performance across relations - very high for some like PersonHasNobelPrize but low for others like PersonHasEmployer. What factors might account for this variability? Does it reveal gaps in the knowledge contained in LLMs?

5. How suitable do you think LLMs are for fully automated knowledge base completion compared to supporting human editors? What are the key challenges faced in using them for fully automated completion?

6. The knowledge gap between Wikipedia and Wikidata caused issues when using Wikipedia for context augmentation. How could this issue be addressed? Could LLMs help align knowledge in Wikipedia and Wikidata?
