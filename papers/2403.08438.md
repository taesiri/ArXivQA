# [Reproducibility and Geometric Intrinsic Dimensionality: An Investigation   on Graph Neural Network Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08438)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reproducibility of machine learning research results is important but challenging to achieve in practice. There is a lack of standardized frameworks to systematically evaluate reproducibility. 
- Another key challenge is the curse of dimensionality, which makes it difficult to obtain representative data and hinders model training and inference. The concept of intrinsic dimension (ID) can help analyze this issue.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a comprehensive ontology of reproducibility for machine learning research to standardize evaluation. The ontology covers 3 main categories - dataset, software, computational results - with detailed subcategories and questions. 
- Apply this ontology to evaluate reproducibility of 6 major graph neural network papers. Identify key reproducibility barriers.
- Investigate the influence of altering geometric intrinsic dimension of datasets on performance of reproduced graph neural network models. Use ID-based feature selection to reduce dimensionality. 

Main Contributions:  
- Novel ontology formalizing various aspects of reproducibility in machine learning, enabling standardized evaluation. Demonstrated via case study on graph neural networks.
- Analysis of reproducibility of influential graph neural network papers based on proposed ontology. Identified several common reproducibility issues.  
- Investigation of influence of intrinsic dimensionality on model performance through controlled experiments. Results indicate dependency of methods on ID.
- Recommendations and best practices for improving reproducibility and accounting for effects of intrinsic dimension in research.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical and empirical contributions regarding reproducibility evaluation in ML and the effects of intrinsic dimensionality. The proposed ontology enables systematic assessment of reproducibility. Experiments highlight the significance of accounting for data dimensionality.
