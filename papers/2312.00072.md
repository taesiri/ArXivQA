# [CRAFT: Contextual Re-Activation of Filters for face recognition Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for face recognition often have a significant number of "inactive" filters in the first convolution layer. An inactive filter is one where the weights have gone to near zero during training, meaning it does not extract any useful features.
- Having many inactive filters represents missed opportunities to extract useful visual features from face images. 
- The paper shows that many popular pre-trained face recognition models have nearly 50% of first layer filters being inactive.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new training approach called "CRAFT" (Contextual Re-Activation of Filters during Training) to reactivate inactive filters.  
- It detects when a filter becomes inactive during training and reinitializes the weights based on context from the other active filters at that point in training. This gives the inactive filter a second chance to learn something useful.

- Two strategies explored for reactivation:
   1) Directed scaled random: Reinitialize inactive filter weights randomly but scaled to match most active filter
   2) CRAFT: Hierarchically replace inactive filters with "complement" of most active filters 

- Show CRAFT is most effective, reducing average inactive filters from 44% to 32% and discovering additional unique filters.

Contributions:
- First approach to automatically detect and reactivate dead filters during CNN training.
- Shows reactivation based on context of other filters is most effective.
- CRAFT reduces inactive filters, discovers additional filters, and achieves higher accuracy on face recognition benchmarks like LFW, CFP-FP etc and challenging IJB-B, IJB-C datasets.
- Analysis shows CRAFT models have more unique filters and better convergence over multiple trainings.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel "filter reactivation" approach during CNN training that leads to learning better face recognition models than standard training.
