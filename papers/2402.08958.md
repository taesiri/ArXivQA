# [Towards Next-Level Post-Training Quantization of Hyper-Scale   Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08958)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the increasing complexity and scale of generative AI models like large language models, efficiently deploying them on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are too slow for quantizing models with billions of parameters. One-shot PTQ methods are fast but have limited performance as they don't consider inter-layer dependencies in Transformers. There is a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in PTQ of large Transformer models.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel PTQ algorithm called \aespa that balances accuracy and efficiency. The key ideas are:

1) Perform quantization layer-wise for efficiency while reconstructing the attention output to account for cross-layer dependencies. This preserves the attention scores better. 

2) Refine the quantization objectives for the attention module so they can be computed efficiently with some precomputations, avoiding repeated attention operations. This makes the process 10x faster.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new quantization strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency by layer-wise quantization but attention-output reconstruction 

- Develops refined quantization objectives for the attention module that avoid repeated attentions and can be computed 10x faster

- Experiments on various language models show \aespa outperforms prior PTQ methods, especially for low 2-bit precision where the perplexity is 2x lower  

- Complexity analysis demonstrates 10x speedup over block-wise PTQ methods

- Shows improved activation quantization performance when combined with existing methods like OmniQuant

In summary, the paper proposes a novel PTQ algorithm called \aespa that pushes the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for quantizing large language models through an attention-centric, efficient and scalable approach. Key innovations are layer-wise quantization, attention-output reconstruction, and refined objectives avoiding repeated attentions.
