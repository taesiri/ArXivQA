# [Can LLMs Master Math? Investigating Large Language Models on Math Stack   Exchange](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to answer mathematical questions poses challenges due to the specialized structure and precision required in math. Prior work has focused more on math questions with straightforward numerical answers rather than open-ended conceptual questions.
- There is a need to evaluate LLMs on their ability to generate accurate answers to open-ended math questions taken from real-world math question platforms like Math Stack Exchange (MSE).

Methodology:
- The authors utilize a set of 78 open-ended undergraduate-level math questions from the MSE-based ArqMATH dataset. 
- They select 6 state-of-the-art LLMs including domain-specialized models like ToRA and general models like GPT-4 and Mistral-7B.
- A two-step evaluation approach is taken: 1) Use the LLMs to generate answers for the 78 MSE questions and match them to reference answers to assess relevance 2) Conduct a case analysis on the top performing LLM by manually evaluating some generated answers.

Results:
- GPT-4 performed the best with a normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) of 0.48 and Precision@10 of 0.37, outperforming existing math-specialized LLMs.
- Case analysis showed GPT-4 can generate relevant responses for some straightforward questions but struggles with more complex questions needing specialized mathematical knowledge.

Contributions:
- First rigorous evaluation of LLMs for generating answers to open-ended conceptual math questions from MSE
- Analysis provides insights into current limitations of even state-of-the-art LLMs in mathematical reasoning 
- Publicly released dataset of LLM generated answers will enable further analysis into math question answering

The paper demonstrates LLMs still have significant challenges in answering complex math questions accurately while showing potential in simpler cases. It establishes a benchmark for progress in mathematical language understanding.
