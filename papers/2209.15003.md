# Compositional Semantic Parsing with Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models be adapted to better generalize compositionally through the use of prompting techniques?The key hypothesis appears to be:Appropriate prompting techniques, such as least-to-most prompting and using exemplars, can enable large language models to solve more realistic compositional generalization tasks.In particular, the paper aims to take prompting techniques that have shown promise on simple artificial tasks like SCAN, and refine them to work on more complex and realistic semantic parsing benchmarks like CFQ and COGS. The core ideas are using syntactic parsing prompts to decompose problems, dynamically selecting exemplars tailored to each input, and prompting the model to solve subproblems sequentially. The hypothesis is that these techniques will allow large LMs to achieve much better compositional generalization on realistic tasks compared to vanilla few-shot prompting or standard fine-tuning approaches. The experiments on CFQ and COGS are designed to test this hypothesis.In summary, the paper is investigating how to adapt prompting to improve compositional generalization of LMs on realistic tasks, with the hypothesis that techniques like least-to-most prompting and tailored exemplars will enable models to systematically generalize better. The CFQ and COGS experiments aim to demonstrate these improvements concretely.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Identifying challenges in applying least-to-most prompting techniques to more realistic compositional generalization tasks like semantic parsing, compared to simpler synthetic tasks like SCAN. Specifically, the challenges identified include more difficult problem decomposition, the need for more knowledge than fits in a single prompt, and context-dependent translation of constituents. 2. Proposing "dynamic least-to-most prompting" as a refinement to address these challenges. The key ideas here are using LM-predicted syntactic parsing to decompose problems into a tree structure, dynamically selecting exemplars based on matching this decomposition tree, and prompting the model to sequentially generate solutions to linearized subproblems based on the decomposition tree.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of dynamic least-to-most prompting by achieving new state-of-the-art results on the CFQ semantic parsing benchmark using only 1% of the training data. The approach also achieves strong results on the COGS benchmark.4. Showing the approach is fairly robust to the exemplar pool size and can remain competitive even when using less than 0.1% of the training data.5. Providing a detailed recipe to apply least-to-most prompting to new tasks, with the aim of improving compositional generalization. The prompts, exemplar selection strategies, and sequential prompting approach are described extensively.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and demonstrating a refined prompting technique to improve compositional generalization on realistic tasks, with extensive details provided to transfer the approach to new problems. The effectiveness is shown on semantic parsing benchmarks where the technique sets new state-of-the-art results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes dynamic least-to-most prompting as a method to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models on complex, realistic semantic parsing tasks by using prompting to syntactically decompose the input, select relevant exemplars, and have the model sequentially generate partial solutions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The paper presents a new approach for enabling compositional generalization in large language models through dynamic least-to-most prompting. This appears to be a novel prompting scheme not explored in prior work. It builds off of previous findings that least-to-most prompting shows promise for compositional generalization, but addresses key limitations to make the approach viable for more complex and realistic tasks.- The paper evaluates the approach on two benchmark datasets designed to test compositional generalization, CFQ and COGS. Performance is compared primarily to prior work using standard supervised training, which has developed specialized models and training techniques aimed at improving compositional generalization. The prompting approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CFQ using only 1% of the training data, highlighting its data efficiency.- Comparing to other prompting work, this approach seems more advanced in its use of dynamic decomposition and exemplar selection tailored to each input based on its syntactic structure. Prior prompting work on compositional generalization tasks is more basic. The chain-of-thought baseline is also a strong prompting approach, but the paper shows the benefits of decomposition.- The approach aims to be task/domain agnostic, making use of general syntactic parsing capabilities of large LMs. This contrasts with some previous work that uses specialized architectures or training augmented with symbolic representations. The approach may be more generally applicable.- There is limited comparison to concurrent work developing similar techniques, like decomposition-based prompting with BART models. More comparison here would help situate the contributions.In summary, the paper introduces a novel prompting scheme that achieves new SOTA for an important NLP benchmark, demonstrating the promise of prompting for compositional generalization. The comparisons could be expanded, but it clearly advances prior prompting approaches. The generality of the approach is a notable potential advantage over specialized model designs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing techniques to improve systematic generalization and compositional generalization of neural models in natural language tasks. The authors note that their approach works very well for the semantic parsing datasets considered, but more work is needed to handle more complex real-world tasks.- Exploring the applicability of least-to-most prompting and related techniques to other domains beyond natural language, such as vision, robotics, reasoning, etc. The prompting methodology seems flexible and general purpose.- Leveraging large language models more extensively as few-shot learners using prompting. The authors mention prompts are a promising alternative to finetuning models.- Using task decomposition techniques like least-to-most prompting to enable knowledge-intensive applications of large language models. Prompting could allow quick adaptation of models to new tasks.- Further analysis and understanding of why prompting techniques like least-to-most perform well, and the capabilities and limitations of large language models. Additional ablation studies seem needed.- Developing better automatic ways to do the decomposition and exemplar selection steps used in least-to-most prompting. The current work relies on some manual effort and rule-based heuristics.In summary, the authors point to promising future work in leveraging large language models for compositional generalization, systematic generalization, and knowledge-intensive applications via prompting and decomposition techniques. But further research is needed to handle more complex real-world tasks and to automate the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a new approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 for compositional generalization. Compositional generalization is the capability to understand and produce novel combinations of known components. The authors identify challenges in applying a recently proposed prompting technique called least-to-most prompting to more realistic compositional generalization benchmarks like CFQ and COGS. These challenges include decomposition being more difficult, translation requiring more knowledge than fits in a prompt, and constituents being context-dependent. To address this, they propose dynamic least-to-most prompting, which uses prompting to syntactically parse the input sentence into a tree structure. This structure guides the dynamic selection of relevant exemplars and the construction of a sequence of subproblems that are sequentially solved by the LLM before predicting the final output. Their method achieves state-of-the-art results on CFQ while using only 1% of the training data. The generality of their approach means it could enable prompting-based compositional generalization in other domains, especially knowledge-intensive ones.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes dynamic least-to-most prompting, a method for adapting large language models (LLMs) to compositional generalization tasks in natural language. Compositional generalization is the ability to understand and produce novel combinations of known components. The authors identify challenges in applying existing prompting techniques like least-to-most prompting to more realistic tasks like the CFQ semantic parsing benchmark. These challenges include more difficult decomposition, larger output spaces, and context-dependence of translation. To address these issues, the proposed dynamic least-to-most prompting first decomposes questions into syntactic parse trees using prompting. It then uses this decomposition to dynamically select relevant exemplars and sequentially prompts the model to generate solutions to simpler subproblems. The authors evaluate dynamic least-to-most prompting on CFQ and COGS semantic parsing benchmarks. For CFQ, it achieves 95% accuracy using only 1% of training data, improving substantially over previous approaches. The method also obtains 99.2% accuracy on COGS generalization set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of decomposition-based prompting for compositional generalization. The generality of the approach makes it promising for adapting LLMs to knowledge-intensive applications across domains.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents a technique called dynamic least-to-most prompting to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on semantic parsing tasks. The key steps are: 1) Use prompting to teach the LLM to decompose the input sentence into a tree structure based on its syntactic parse. 2) Dynamically select a small set of exemplars from a pool of training data that collectively cover the components in the decomposition tree. 3) Linearize the tree into a sequence of simpler subproblems. 4) Use prompting to teach the LLM to sequentially translate each subproblem beginning with the simplest, using the selected exemplars and previously predicted solutions as prompt context. By decomposing problems and solving them incrementally using relevant examples, the approach allows LLMs to systematically generalize to novel composite meanings not seen during training. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging CFQ semantic parsing benchmark while using only 1% of the training data.
