# [Chance-Constrained Control for Safe Spacecraft Autonomy: Convex   Programming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safety for autonomous spacecraft under uncertainties. Key uncertainties include navigation error, maneuver execution error, and imperfect force models. Designing guidance, navigation and control (GNC) algorithms that can provide safety guarantees under such uncertainties is difficult due to constraints like limited on-board computation and stringent safety requirements.   

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a chance-constrained control framework to formulate the safe spacecraft autonomy problem. This allows directly controlling state distributions instead of just mean trajectories. The core idea is to solve for a sequence of control policies that minimize a probabilistic cost function while satisfying probabilistic constraints on state and control with high confidence levels (e.g. 99%). This enables handling unbounded distributions from navigation filters.

The paper gathers and extends techniques to accommodate key cost functions and constraints in spacecraft GNC using concepts like quantile functions and convex conservative approximations of chance constraints. It exploits the Markov property of the system dynamics to formulate a tractable convex optimization problem. The resulting control policies calculate safe maneuvers using imperfect state estimates.

Contributions:
1) Formulates safe spacecraft autonomy under uncertainty as a chance-constrained stochastic optimal control problem 
2) Incorporates notable cost functions and constraints like keep-out zones, approach cones, tube constraints via conservative convex restrictions
3) Develops a computationally tractable convex programming based solution to design robust control policies  
4) Demonstrates the proposed autonomy framework on two representative examples - safe rendezvous under CWH equations and cislunar NRHO station-keeping.

In summary, the paper provides a principled and systematic approach to safe spacecraft autonomy by leveraging recent advances in chance-constrained control and convex optimization. The proposed methods enable designing control policies that explicitly consider uncertainties and safety requirements.
