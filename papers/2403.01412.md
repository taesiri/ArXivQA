# [LUM-ViT: Learnable Under-sampling Mask Vision Transformer for Bandwidth   Limited Optical Signal Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01412)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Bandwidth constraints during signal acquisition frequently impede real-time detection applications, especially for hyperspectral data which has a large data volume. 
- Traditional compressive sensing methods struggle to reconstruct images with very low under-sampling rates (<30%). They also cannot effectively leverage prior knowledge of the objects being detected.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel deep learning approach called LUM-ViT that integrates optical hardware (DMD) to achieve undersampling of hyperspectral images prior to acquisition. 
- LUM-ViT is based on Vision Transformers (ViT) and uses the DMD system to optically compute the patch embeddings. It has a learnable undersampling mask that determines which patch embeddings to retain or bypass based on their importance to the downstream task.
- They also propose kernel-level weight binarization of the patch embedding convolutions to make them compatible with the binary DMD operations. 
- A 3-stage training strategy is used - (1) train mask, (2) train binarized layer, (3) finetune full network.

Main Contributions:
- Novel integration of optical hardware with deep learning to achieve undersampling prior to hyperspectral image acquisition. This significantly reduces bandwidth requirements.
- Design of LUM-ViT architecture with learnable undersampling mask that identifies important patch embeddings for retention.
- Kernel-level weight binarization technique to conform computations with binary DMD operations.
- Demonstration of LUM-ViT maintaining good performance (<5.5% drop) even with extreme 2% undersampling on ImageNet.
- Additional experiments confirming feasibility on real DMD hardware with 4% max performance drop on RGB images. Also efficacy on hyperspectral datasets.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in enabling real-time hyperspectral image analysis under strict bandwidth constraints by strategically undersampling prior to acquisition while retaining performance. The learnable masking approach outperforms basic undersampling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 LUM-ViT introduces a novel deep learning approach using a Vision Transformer variant with a learnable undersampling mask and kernel-level weight binarization to reduce hyperspectral data acquisition volume through pre-acquisition modulation with a digital micromirror device while maintaining performance in downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of LUM-ViT, a Vision Transformer variant that incorporates a learnable under-sampling mask tailored for pre-acquisition modulation using a digital micromirror device (DMD). Specifically:

1) LUM-ViT enables under-sampling of hyperspectral data acquisition through a learnable binary mask applied after the patch embedding layer. This allows selective retention of only the most essential embedded points for downstream classification tasks, bypassing less useful ones. This effectively reduces the data volume acquired.

2) The patch embedding layer is adapted to conform with DMD constraints via kernel-level weight binarization and single-channel convolutions. This enables execution of the patch embedding computations optically using the DMD prior to data acquisition.

3) A three-stage training strategy is introduced to effectively train LUM-ViT. This accounts for difficulties arising from jointly training the learnable mask and binarized components.

4) Evaluations on ImageNet classification and real-world optical hardware experiments demonstrate that LUM-ViT can maintain high performance even with extreme under-sampling rates below 10%, validating its practical feasibility. Additional experiments on hyperspectral datasets further confirm its ability to handle real-world hyperspectral data.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and demonstration of LUM-ViT, a ViT model capable of pre-acquisition optical modulation for under-sampling suited for bandwidth-constrained hyperspectral data acquisition.
