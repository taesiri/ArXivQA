# [MuRF: Multi-Baseline Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04565)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents Multi-Baseline Radiance Fields (MuRF), a feed-forward neural network approach for novel view synthesis from sparse input views with different camera baselines. The key ideas are: (1) Constructing a target view frustum volume that aggregates information from input views in a way that is spatially aligned with the target view to render. This facilitates better information aggregation compared to volumes constructed in a predefined reference view. (2) Using a convolutional neural network decoder to model 3D context between points and reconstruct a higher quality radiance field from the volume. Experiments on datasets with small (DTU, LLFF) and large (RealEstate10K) baselines demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and good generalization ability. The method handles different numbers of input views and outperforms prior specialized models for either small or large baselines. The target view volume representation and convolutional decoder enable rendering higher quality scene structures compared to prior works. Promising results are also shown on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, indicating the general applicability of the method.
