# [DiffHuman: Probabilistic Photorealistic 3D Reconstruction of Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00485)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for photorealistic 3D human reconstruction from a single image are deterministic and output a single solution. However, this problem is ill-posed due to depth ambiguity, occlusion and unseen body parts. A single solution is often not sufficient and exhibits lack of detail, especially for uncertain surface regions like the back of a person.

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents DiffHuman, a probabilistic diffusion model that predicts a distribution over plausible 3D human reconstructions conditioned on an input image. This allows sampling of multiple detailed 3D avatars during inference that are diverse yet consistent with the input image. 

DiffHuman models a distribution over pixel-aligned observations (albedo, normals, depth) of an underlying implicit 3D surface representing human geometry and appearance. The model is trained to denoise such observations using a conditional DDPM framework. Denoising involves either rendering an intermediate implicit surface conditioned on noisy observations or using a generator network that predicts denoised observations. The final surface sample is obtained after iterative denoising steps.

Main Contributions:

- A novel probabilistic diffusion model for photorealistic 3D human reconstruction that predicts distributions over solutions instead of a single output.

- A dual-branch framework with a generator network that speeds up diffusion-via-rendering by 55x during inference.

- Experiments showing the model produces diverse and detailed reconstructions with improved quality over state-of-the-art methods, especially for unseen surfaces.

- Demonstration of sampling multiple input-consistent 3D humans with high color and geometric detail from a single image.
