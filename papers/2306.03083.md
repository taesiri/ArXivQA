# [MotionDiffuser: Controllable Multi-Agent Motion Prediction using   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03083)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: How can we develop an effective representation for modeling the joint distribution over future trajectories of multiple interacting agents?The key points are:- Motion prediction is inherently probabilistic and multi-modal, requiring models that can capture the full distribution over diverse, plausible future outcomes. - It is important to model interactions between agents and reason about their joint future trajectories, rather than modeling agents independently.- Existing methods like regressors or anchor-based models are limited in their ability to capture multimodal futures and joint interactions. - This paper proposes using denoising diffusion models as a way to learn a strong generative representation of the joint future distribution.So in summary, the core research contribution is developing a diffusion-based method to effectively model the complex, multimodal joint distribution over future trajectories of multiple interacting agents. This allows sampling diverse, consistent futures while reasoning about inter-agent interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing MotionDiffuser, a novel framework for multi-agent motion prediction using conditional denoising diffusion models. This allows modeling the joint probability distribution over future trajectories of multiple agents.- A transformer-based set denoiser architecture that is permutation invariant across agents, allowing it to learn a joint trajectory distribution regardless of agent ordering.- A general framework for constrained trajectory sampling that enables controlling the sampling process using arbitrary differentiable cost functions. This enables applications like enforcing driving rules, trajectory in-painting, and creating tailored driving scenarios.- Enhancements like PCA-based latent trajectory representation to improve training and sampling efficiency, exact log probability inference, and improved clustering of samples.- State-of-the-art results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset for multi-agent motion forecasting. The method is shown to be effective at generating diverse, multimodal trajectory predictions and performing controlled sampling.In summary, the core novelties are in using diffusion models for multi-agent trajectory prediction in a permutation invariant way, the flexible constrained sampling framework, and enhancements like the PCA representation. The combination of these contributions leads to improved performance on a challenging motion forecasting benchmark.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:This paper introduces MotionDiffuser, a diffusion model-based framework for controllable multi-agent motion prediction that learns a diverse joint distribution over future trajectories, enables exact log probability inference, and allows constrained trajectory sampling via differentiable costs to enforce priors and create tailored scenarios.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related work in multi-agent motion prediction:- Compared to other regression-based trajectory prediction models like SceneTransformer, DenseTNT, and MultiPath++, this paper proposes using denoising diffusion models to learn a generative model of the joint trajectory distribution. This allows sampling diverse, multimodal futures rather than predicting a fixed set of outcomes.- Unlike recent generative models for motion prediction like conditional VAEs and normalizing flows, this work utilizes diffusion models which have shown strong performance for high-dimensional, complex distributions in other domains like images and videos. Diffusion models have some advantages like simplicity and flexibility.- For multi-agent modeling specifically, this paper proposes a permutation invariant set denoising architecture using transformer networks. Other recent multi-agent works like M2I, WIMP, and PIP don't consider permutation invariance. Some graph-based methods like DSDNet and MFP use fully-connected graphs rather than learning interactions.- A key novelty is the proposed controllable sampling framework to guide trajectory generation based on differentiable costs. This enables applications like enforcing rules and physical constraints. Other works don't demonstrate this level of control over the joint trajectory distribution.- The proposed PCA-based latent variable formulation is unique for trajectory prediction. Using a compressed latent space representation with diffusion models improves results.- Compared to concurrent work on traffic modeling like GTC, this paper demonstrates strong performance on the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset for autonomous driving.- Overall, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Waymo motion prediction benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the diffusion model design. The controllable sampling and exact log probability inference are also unique capabilities not present in prior arts.In summary, this paper makes several key contributions in advancing multi-agent motion prediction using diffusion models, constraint-based sampling, and representation enhancements. The results validate these techniques against regression baselines and recent generative model approaches.
