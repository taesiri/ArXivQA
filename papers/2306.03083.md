# [MotionDiffuser: Controllable Multi-Agent Motion Prediction using   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03083)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: How can we develop an effective representation for modeling the joint distribution over future trajectories of multiple interacting agents?The key points are:- Motion prediction is inherently probabilistic and multi-modal, requiring models that can capture the full distribution over diverse, plausible future outcomes. - It is important to model interactions between agents and reason about their joint future trajectories, rather than modeling agents independently.- Existing methods like regressors or anchor-based models are limited in their ability to capture multimodal futures and joint interactions. - This paper proposes using denoising diffusion models as a way to learn a strong generative representation of the joint future distribution.So in summary, the core research contribution is developing a diffusion-based method to effectively model the complex, multimodal joint distribution over future trajectories of multiple interacting agents. This allows sampling diverse, consistent futures while reasoning about inter-agent interactions.
