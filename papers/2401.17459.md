# [A Preliminary Study on Using Large Language Models in Software   Pentesting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Software penetration testing is an important step to identify vulnerabilities in code. However, it requires significant manual effort and expertise. Existing automated tools like SonarQube generate many false positives leading to pentester fatigue.  

- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automating tasks requiring reasoning and nuanced understanding. The paper hypothesizes that an LLM-based AI agent can be improved over time through prompt engineering as it interacts with human users.

Proposed Solution:
- Build AI agents using LLMs like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT to analyze source code and identify vulnerabilities. 

- Engineer prompts to provide context and structure so models provide more accurate results. Prompts are augmented based on analyzing training data to add guidance specific to the vulnerability category.

- Evaluate on OWASP Benchmark test cases. Compare performance of base prompts versus augmented prompts on unseen test data. Also compare against SonarQube results.

Key Contributions:
- Viability study of using LLMs for software penetration testing through experiments on a standard benchmark.

- Demonstrates efficacy of prompt engineering to improve accuracy over time. Augmented prompt accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo using Assistants API matches or exceeds SonarQube in most categories.

- Analyzes cases where LLMs fail to identify root causes like insufficient understanding of code flow and weak algorithms.

- Discusses tailored prompt engineering for each LLM versus one-size-fits-all evaluation strategy.

In summary, the paper presents a preliminary study showing LLMs can be viable for software penetration testing and their accuracy improves via prompt engineering based on usage feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents a preliminary study on using large language models for software vulnerability detection, showing that through prompt engineering, the accuracy of LLMs can improve over repeated usage and match or exceed that of existing tools like SonarQube.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a preliminary study on the viability of using large language models (LLMs) for software penetration testing. Specifically:

1) The paper builds several AI agents using different LLMs (Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and APIs (Chat Completion and Assistants). These agents are designed to analyze source code and identify potential vulnerabilities.

2) The paper evaluates the performance of these AI agents on the OWASP Benchmark test suite. The test cases are divided into training and testing sets to examine whether prompt engineering on the training set can improve accuracy on the unseen testing set.

3) The results show that with proper prompt engineering, the GPT-4 model using Assistants API demonstrated improved accuracy compared to the base prompts, outperforming or matching the commercial tool SonarQube on most vulnerability categories. 

4) The paper provides an analysis investigating why LLMs struggle on certain test cases, showing issues in reasoning about code flow and identifying weak algorithms.

In summary, the key contribution is providing evidence that LLMs are a viable approach for building AI agents for software penetration testing that can improve over time through prompt engineering based on usage. The analysis also sheds light on current limitations of LLMs in this application space.

The paper presents a preliminary study on using LLMs for software pentesting to identify vulnerabilities in source code. It utilizes the OWASP Benchmark dataset to evaluate different LLM models, including Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. A key aspect is engineering the prompts fed to the LLMs to improve accuracy over time. The results are compared to SonarQube as a baseline. Some key findings are that prompt engineering can enhance LLM accuracy in this domain, with GPT-4 demonstrating the best performance, and that limitations exist around reasoning of code flow and identifying weak algorithms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper divides the OWASP benchmark dataset into a training set and a testing set. What is the rationale behind this split? How does it model a real-world scenario for improving an AI agent's performance over time?

2. The paper categorizes the cases where the LLMs make mistakes into two types - those involving code flow and those involving use of weak algorithms. What are some examples of mistakes in each category? How do the added prompts in Table 3 address these types of mistakes?

3. How exactly does prompt engineering allow the LLMs' performance to improve over repeated usage? What is the underlying mechanism that enables this capability not present in traditional software tools?

4. The results show that GPT-4-Turbo using the Assistants API demonstrates the most substantial improvements from prompt engineering. Why might this particular LLM and API combination perform the best? What are the key differences between the Chat Completions and Assistants APIs?

5. For the cases where augmented prompts do not increase performance, what might be some reasons why? How could the prompt engineering process be improved to increase consistency of performance gains from augmentation?  

6. The paper mentions adopting a more tailored approach to prompt engineering for each LLM rather than a one-size-fits-all strategy. What are some ways this could be implemented? How might it better reflect real-world usage?

7. Beyond accuracy, what are some other metrics and dimensions along which the LLMs' utility could be evaluated? How might taking a more human-centered evaluation approach address some limitations?  

8. How do the prompts provide context and structure to guide the LLM? What is the intention behind directives such as "double check your report" and threshold of 100% confidence?

9. How useful do you think LLMs can be in other parts of the software development lifecycle besides pentesting? Which tasks or functions seem particularly suited to their capabilities?

10. What directions for future work on applying LLMs to software security tasks seem promising to explore? What are some key open challenges or limitations that still need to be addressed?
