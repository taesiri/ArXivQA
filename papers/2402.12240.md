# [BEARS Make Neuro-Symbolic Models Aware of their Reasoning Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12240)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) models integrate neural networks with symbolic knowledge to make more reliable predictions. However, they can fall prey to "reasoning shortcuts" (RSs) - they learn concepts that exploit unintended semantics to make correct predictions, compromising reliability.  
- RSs make models overconfident about concept predictions. Existing NeSy models are not "reasoning shortcut-aware", i.e. they don't identify which concepts are unreliable due to RSs. This reduces trust in their predictions.

Proposed Solution: 
- Rather than attempting to avoid RSs which is challenging, the paper proposes making models "shortcut-aware" - uncertain about concepts affected by RSs. This allows users to identify and avoid unreliable concepts.

- The paper introduces BEARS (BE Aware of Reasoning Shortcuts), an ensembling technique to improve RS-awareness without reliance on expensive concept-level supervision. 

- BEARS trains an ensemble of concept extractors that achieve high accuracy but capture conflicting reasoning shortcuts. Averaging their predictions results in high uncertainty for concepts affected by RSs.

Main Contributions:
- Shifts focus from RS mitigation to RS awareness, shows NeSy models are not naturally RS-aware
- Proposes BEARS to improve RS-awareness by maximizing concept-level entropy
- Empirically demonstrates BEARS substantially improves RS-awareness across tasks and architectures without harming accuracy or needing supervision
- Shows BEARS enables effective active learning to acquire concept annotations for RS mitigation

In summary, the paper addresses the important problem of reasoning shortcuts in NeSy models compromising reliability. It shows improving awareness of unreliable concepts allows safe usage, and contributes an effective unsupervised technique BEARS to achieve this.
