# [Remove that Square Root: A New Efficient Scale-Invariant Version of   AdaGrad](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02648)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adaptive optimization methods like AdaGrad are popular as they automatically tune the learning rate. However, AdaGrad performs poorly on ill-conditioned or poorly scaled data. 

- The paper aims to develop an adaptive optimization algorithm that is invariant to scaling of the data and matches AdaGrad's convergence guarantees.

Proposed Method (KATE):
- The paper proposes a new algorithm called KATE which is a variant of AdaGrad with two key changes:
  1) It removes the square root from AdaGrad's denominator to make the step size scale-invariant. 
  2) It uses a more aggressive sequence in the numerator to compensate and ensure convergence.

- KATE updates each weight coordinate as:  
    w[k] += - (beta*m[k]) / (b[k]^2) * g[k]
     Where b accumulates past gradients, m grows over time, g is the current gradient.

- For generalized linear models, the paper proves KATE is scale-invariant - its functional values are identical for scaled and unscaled data when started from zero weights.

Convergence Guarantees:
- For smooth non-convex problems, KATE achieves the optimal O(log(T)/sqrt(T)) convergence rate in terms of expected gradient norm, matching AdaGrad and Adam. 

- The analysis handles the more aggressive steps of KATE using properties like decreasing step size and closed-form bounds.

Experiments:
- Experiments on logistic regression and neural networks for image/text classification tasks show KATE consistently matches/beats AdaGrad and Adam.

- Plots also validate the scale-invariance on a synthetic logistic regression task.

In summary, the paper develops a scale-invariant adaptive method KATE that enjoys optimal convergence guarantees and strong empirical performance on par with popular techniques like Adam.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces KATE, a new adaptive optimization algorithm that is a scale-invariant version of AdaGrad, proves its convergence for smooth non-convex problems, and shows empirically that it matches or outperforms AdaGrad and Adam across several machine learning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a new optimization algorithm called KATE, which is a scale-invariant version of AdaGrad. Specifically, KATE removes the square root from the denominator of the AdaGrad step size to make it scale-invariant, and introduces a new sequence in the numerator to compensate.

2) It proves that KATE is scale-invariant for generalized linear models. If the starting point is zero, the loss values and accuracies generated by KATE are independent of the scaling of the data.

3) For general smooth non-convex problems, it establishes an O(log(T)/sqrt(T)) convergence rate for KATE, matching the best known rates for AdaGrad and Adam. 

4) It compares KATE empirically to AdaGrad and Adam on several machine learning tasks involving logistic regression, image classification, and text classification. The results show that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and matches or exceeds the performance of Adam in all scenarios.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and analysis of a new scale-invariant adaptive optimization algorithm called KATE that has strong theoretical convergence guarantees and also strong empirical performance across a range of tasks.

The paper introduces a new adaptive optimization algorithm called KATE, which is a scale-invariant version of AdaGrad. It analyzes the convergence properties of KATE for smooth non-convex problems and shows it matches the best known rates of AdaGrad and Adam. Experiments demonstrate the scale invariance of KATE for generalized linear models. Comparisons on tasks like image classification and text classification also show KATE matches or exceeds the performance of other adaptive methods like Adam and AdaGrad. So the key focus areas are adaptive methods, convergence theory, scale invariance, and empirical performance on machine learning tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new sequence $\{m_t\}$ in the numerator of the step size that makes it more aggressive compared to standard AdaGrad. What is the motivation behind this choice and how does the inclusion of this sequence lead to better empirical performance?

2. Proposition 1 establishes the scale-invariance property of the proposed method for generalized linear models. Can you provide some additional intuition on why removing the square root in the denominator results in scale-invariance? 

3. The paper claims the method matches the $\mathcal{O}(\log T/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate of AdaGrad and Adam. However, the proof techniques seem more involved due to the inclusion of the additional $\{m_t\}$ sequence. Can you highlight the key ideas used in the convergence analysis?

4. How does the technique of using a surrogate step size in Lemma 3 help simplify the analysis? Can you relate this to some existing analysis techniques for adaptive methods?

5. The scale-invariance property is shown only for generalized linear models. What modifications would be needed to establish this more broadly for smooth non-convex problems?

6. Could the technique be extended to show linear convergence for strongly convex problems similar to some AdaGrad variants in the literature? What challenges would you anticipate? 

7. The method has a few hyperparameters, including the initial accumulation term $\eta$. How should these be set in practice and are there any tricks to make the method more robust to misspecification?

8. The experiments focus on logistic regression and neural network training. For what other machine learning methods might you expect KATE to be impactful compared to Adam or AdaGrad?

9. Recent work on distance-based adaptive methods have shown promising performance by estimating the distance to solution. Could any ideas from those methods be incorporated into KATE?

10. The analysis depends on some conditions on the stepsizes to establish convergence. Do you think these could be relaxed or removed entirely? How might the analysis need to be modified?
