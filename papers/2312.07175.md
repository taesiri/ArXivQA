# [Instrumental Variable Estimation for Causal Inference in Longitudinal   Data with Time-Dependent Latent Confounders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07175)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Time-dependent Instrumental Factor Model (TIFM) to estimate causal effects over time from longitudinal observational data in the presence of latent time-dependent confounders. TIFM employs a recurrent neural network architecture to learn a substitute of the latent time-dependent instrumental variable (IV) from the historical data at each time step. It then leverages the inferred substitute IV within a two-stage least squares regression to mitigate the bias caused by latent time-dependent confounders and estimate the causal effects. The authors provide theoretical analysis to justify using the learned substitute IV for unbiased causal effect estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that TIFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy over time. A case study on a real-world climate dataset further shows the effectiveness and practical applicability of TIFM. Overall, TIFM offers an innovative way to address the open challenge of discovering valid time-dependent IVs for reliable causal inference from longitudinal data.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors study a crucial problem in longitudinal studies and propose to use a substitute of latent time-dependent IV for estimating causal effect in the presence of latent time-dependent confounders. They theoretically analyze the soundness of using the substitute of latent time-dependent IV for this purpose.

2) They propose a novel Time-dependent Instrumental Factor Model (TIFM) to learn the substitute of latent time-dependent IV from data. To the best of their knowledge, this is the first method which learns a substitute of time-dependent IV from longitudinal data directly. 

3) Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and a real-world climate dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TIFM in causal effect estimation from longitudinal data with latent time-dependent confounders.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the TIFM method to learn a substitute of latent time-dependent IV from longitudinal data, and showing its effectiveness for causal effect estimation in the presence of latent time-dependent confounders.

The paper proposes a novel time-dependent instrumental factor model (TIFM) to estimate causal effects over time from longitudinal data in the presence of latent time-dependent confounders. It uses an RNN architecture to infer a substitute for the latent time-dependent IV from history data. This substitute IV is then used within a TSLS framework to mitigate confounding bias and estimate causal effects. Theoretical analysis is provided for the soundness of the TIFM method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world climate datasets demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Some key terms like longitudinal data analysis, causal inference, time-dependent confounding, instrumental variables, and deep learning models recur throughout the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Time-dependent Instrumental Factor Model (TIFM) to learn a substitute of the latent time-dependent instrumental variable (IV). What are the key advantages of using a learned substitute over using a predefined IV, especially in contexts where a valid predefined IV is unavailable?

2. The paper utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with long short-term memory (LSTM) to model the time dependencies and capture the substitute IV. What are the benefits of using RNN-LSTM over other sequence modeling techniques for this task? How can the model architecture be further improved?

3. Theoretical analysis is provided in the paper to justify using the learned substitute as a valid IV for estimating causal effects over time. What are the key assumptions made in this analysis? How can they be further relaxed or tested? 

4. How does the proposed method compare with existing techniques for handling time-dependent confounders in longitudinal studies, such as marginal structural models? What are the relative merits and limitations?

5. The Two-Stage Least Squares (TSLS) estimator is used in conjunction with the learned substitute IV. What other IV estimators can potentially be used instead of TSLS? What adaptations may be needed?

6. What strategies can be employed to select the appropriate time-lag and model complexity when modeling the substitute IV in practical applications? How to address overfitting in such sequence modeling scenarios?

7. The experimental evaluation relies largely on synthetic datasets. What additional experiments are needed to establish the effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world longitudinal data?

8. How can domain knowledge, when available, be effectively incorporated into the proposed framework - both in terms of model selection and evaluation?

9. What adaptations are needed to apply the proposed methodology in contexts where there are multiple, heterogeneous treatments over time as opposed to a single treatment variable?

10. From an application perspective, what are some promising real-world use cases where the proposed method can potentially enable new findings by tackling previously intractable causal questions involving longitudinal data?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Causal effect estimation from longitudinal observational data is challenging due to difficulty in identifying time-dependent confounders, especially latent ones. 
- Traditional instrumental variable (IV) methods cannot deal with latent time-dependent confounders in longitudinal studies.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Time-dependent Instrumental Factor Model (TIFM) to estimate time-varying causal effects from data with latent time-dependent confounders.

- The key idea is to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture at each time step to infer a latent IV factor from the historical data. 

- This latent IV factor is then used to address the confounding bias caused by latent time-dependent confounders.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first method to learn a substitute of time-dependent IV from longitudinal data directly using deep learning.

- Provides theoretical analysis to show the latent IV factor inferred by TIFM can serve as a valid instrument for unbiased causal effect estimation.

- Extensive experiments on synthetic data demonstrate TIFM's effectiveness in estimating causal effects over time. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.

- Applies TIFM to a real-world climate dataset to showcase its potential for tackling problems in various domains involving longitudinal data.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions regarding using deep learning to infer latent time-dependent IVs for unbiased causal effect estimation from longitudinal data. Both theory and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed TIFM method.
