# [BEDD: The MineRL BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset for   Training and Benchmarking Agents that Solve Fuzzy Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02405)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset (BEDD), consisting of a large dataset of human demonstrations and algorithm evaluations for facilitating research on learning from human feedback (LfHF). BEDD includes 26 million image-action pairs from nearly 14,000 videos of humans completing complex, underspecified tasks in Minecraft, as well as over 3,000 dense human evaluations comparing algorithmic agents on their ability to solve these tasks. The data comes from the MineRL BASALT competition focused on fuzzy tasks lacking well-defined rewards. Alongside releasing the dataset, the authors analyze properties of the data, like proxy metrics for tracking agent training progress, sentiment analysis of human justifications, and score breakdowns on various factors that influence judgements of agent capability. To enable use of BEDD, they also contribute code for utilizing the data to train and evaluate LfHF algorithms. By releasing this extensive benchmark, the authors aim to drive further research on developing agents that can effectively leverage more natural forms of human feedback to solve complex, real-world tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset (BEDD), consisting of over 26 million image-action pairs from 14,000 videos of humans completing hard-to-specify Minecraft tasks and over 3,000 human evaluations of algorithmic and human agents, to facilitate progress on learning from human feedback algorithms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces the BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset (BEDD), which consists of:

1) The Demonstrations Dataset: Over 26 million image-action pairs from 14,000 videos of human players successfully completing the four reward-free BASALT tasks in Minecraft. This can be used to train learning from human feedback (LfHF) algorithms.

2) The Evaluation Dataset: Over 3,000 dense pairwise human evaluations comparing 17 different agents (top teams from BASALT 2022, a behavioral cloning baseline, a random agent, and two human experts) across five factors when attempting the BASALT tasks. This serves as a benchmark leaderboard for evaluating new LfHF algorithms.

3) Code for utilizing the datasets, including an example of training a model on the Demonstrations Dataset and evaluating it using the Evaluation Dataset.

The main contribution is providing an accessible dataset and standardized benchmark to catalyze progress in learning from human feedback for complex, hard-to-specify tasks. The detailed analysis also offers insights to guide algorithm development and evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- BASALT (Benchmark for Agents that Solve Tasks from Language) - A benchmark for developing agents that can solve tasks specified through natural language descriptions rather than explicit reward functions. The benchmark consists of fuzzy tasks in Minecraft.  

- BEDD (BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset) - The dataset introduced in this paper, consisting of human demonstrations for completing the BASALT tasks and human evaluations comparing algorithm performance.

- Learning from human feedback - Using forms of human guidance such as preferences, corrections, demonstrations etc. to train agents, rather than relying solely on reward functions. A key focus of the BASALT benchmark.

- Fuzzy tasks - Tasks that lack clear formal specifications or reward functions. The BASALT tasks fall under this category.

- Minecraft - The environment used for the BASALT benchmark tasks. Provides a rich, open-ended environment to specify complex goals.

- Demonstrations dataset - Over 26 million state-action pairs showing humans completing the BASALT tasks. Used for imitation learning.

- Evaluation dataset - Over 3,000 dense human comparisons between 17 agents on the BASALT tasks. Serves as a benchmark leaderboard.  

- TrueSkill - The rating system used to evaluate and rank agent performance on the BASALT tasks based on human judgments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset (BEDD) to facilitate progress on fuzzy tasks where reward functions are difficult to specify. What are some key benefits of providing both demonstrations and evaluations together in a unified benchmark? What are some limitations?

2. The paper analyzes proxy metrics in the demonstrations, like episode length and right mouse clicks, to estimate properties like task difficulty and agent performance. What other proxy metrics could be useful to analyze? How could they mislead if used improperly?  

3. The evaluation dataset relies heavily on pairwise comparisons between agents. What are some pros and cons of this approach instead of independent assessments? How might you augment the dataset to enable developing automated metrics?

4. The paper uses the TrueSkill rating system to evaluate and compare agent performance. What are some advantages of TrueSkill over using raw human judgments? What cautions should be kept in mind when interpreting TrueSkill ratings?

5. What factors influenced the higher positive sentiment scores for the FindCave and MakeWaterfall tasks compared to the other tasks? How could the phrasing of questions, perception of "easy" vs "hard" tasks, or other elements play a role?

6. The data contains trajectories from both successful and unsuccessful human demonstrations. What complications does this cause? What techniques could make use of the unsuccessful episodes during training?  

7. The data is collected from contractors through Upwork. How might this impact the distribution and diversity of strategies? What biases might this introduce that influence the data?

8. The paper compares human performance to the top BASALT agents. What key gaps still remain in the agents' capabilities compared to humans based on the analysis? What areas should be prioritized to close this gap?

9. The benchmarks tasks currently test embodied navigation and construction skills. What new skills would you propose adding tasks for, and why? What environments beyond Minecraft could complement it?

10. The data enables developing algorithms that learn from human feedback. What steps could be taken during data collection, training, or evaluation to ensure these algorithms behave safely, ethically, and avoid harmful biases?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning complex tasks from human feedback is challenging. The MineRL BASALT competition tasks, such as creating a waterfall in Minecraft, exemplify this challenge. After two years of competitions, no algorithm has matched human performance. To spur progress, there is a need to formalize BASALT as a benchmark with standardized evaluation procedures and supporting datasets.

Proposed Solution:
The authors present the BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset (BEDD) to establish BASALT as a benchmark. BEDD consists of:

1) Demonstrations Dataset: 26 million image-action pairs from 14,000 videos of humans completing BASALT tasks. This can be used to train algorithms.

2) Evaluations Dataset: Over 3,000 pairwise comparisons by humans evaluating videos of 17 agents (competition entries, humans, baselines) attempting the tasks. Includes multi-factor assessment (e.g. cave found, human-likeness) and free response justification. Can serve as a preliminary leaderboard to compare new algorithms.

3) Codebase: Provides data loading/preprocessing, training examples, evaluation protocol implementation. Allows quick development and comparison to benchmark.

The authors analyze both datasets to provide insights for algorithm development and evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the BASALT benchmark with concrete evaluation recommendations 
- Release of the large-scale BEDD dataset for developing and evaluating human feedback algorithms
- Detailed analysis of demonstrations and evaluations data to guide research
- Codebase to quickly prototype and compare algorithms to benchmark

The public release of BEDD and clear benchmark should spur progress in learning complex tasks from human feedback. Standardized evaluation will prevent false signals of progress.
