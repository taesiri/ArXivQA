# [BEDD: The MineRL BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset for   Training and Benchmarking Agents that Solve Fuzzy Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02405)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset (BEDD), consisting of a large dataset of human demonstrations and algorithm evaluations for facilitating research on learning from human feedback (LfHF). BEDD includes 26 million image-action pairs from nearly 14,000 videos of humans completing complex, underspecified tasks in Minecraft, as well as over 3,000 dense human evaluations comparing algorithmic agents on their ability to solve these tasks. The data comes from the MineRL BASALT competition focused on fuzzy tasks lacking well-defined rewards. Alongside releasing the dataset, the authors analyze properties of the data, like proxy metrics for tracking agent training progress, sentiment analysis of human justifications, and score breakdowns on various factors that influence judgements of agent capability. To enable use of BEDD, they also contribute code for utilizing the data to train and evaluate LfHF algorithms. By releasing this extensive benchmark, the authors aim to drive further research on developing agents that can effectively leverage more natural forms of human feedback to solve complex, real-world tasks.
