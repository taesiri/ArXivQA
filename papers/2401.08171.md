# [Deep Linear Array Pushbroom Image Restoration: A Degradation Pipeline   and Jitter-Aware Restoration Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Linear Array Pushbroom (LAP) imaging is widely used in remote sensing, but images often suffer from distortion and blur due to camera jitter during image acquisition.
- Traditional methods have limited performance in restoring degraded LAP images. Mainstream deep learning models for image restoration also struggle on this task due to lack of jitter priors.  
- There is also a lack of customized LAP image datasets with realistic jitter-based degradation for training restoration models.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a complete image restoration pipeline, including:
   - A LAP image degradation pipeline that applies Continue Dynamic Shooting Model (CDSM) to simulate realistic jitter and generate degraded training data from clean aerial images.
   - A jitter-aware restoration network (JARNet) that restores images in two stages:
      - Stage 1: Optical Flow Correction (OFC) block that refines the jitter-based optical flow and uses it to pre-correct distortion in degraded LAP images.
      - Stage 2: Spatial and Frequency Residual (SFRes) block with jitter-aware coordinate attention and frequency branches to further enhance the pre-corrected images.

Main Contributions:
- A CDSM-based pipeline for realistic LAP image degradation simulation and dataset creation.
- The first complete jitter-aware pipeline for LAP image restoration, including OFC and SFRes blocks tailored for this task. 
- State-of-the-art restoration performance on real and simulated LAP images, with over 1.2dB PSNR gain over previous methods.
- Extensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of different components of the proposed method.

In summary, this paper tackles LAP image restoration via specialized jitter simulation, modeling and deep network design. Both the degradation simulation pipeline and jitter-aware JARNet model establish a strong foundation for restoring this unique and intricate image modality.
