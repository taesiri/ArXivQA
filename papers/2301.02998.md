# [InPars-Light: Cost-Effective Unsupervised Training of Efficient Rankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02998)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research questions addressed in this paper are:

1) RQ1: Do information retrieval (IR) capabilities emerge merely from a large-scale next-token-prediction training? The authors want to investigate if IR capabilities can emerge from just training a large language model (LLM) on a next-token prediction task, without any explicit IR-specific objectives or training.

2) RQ2: Are open-source models more or less useful for generation of synthetic IR training data compared to the similar-size GPT-3 model? The authors compare using open-source LLMs versus the proprietary GPT-3 model for generating synthetic training queries.

3) RQ3: Does consistency checking proposed by Dai et al. (2022) indeed beneficial? Is it applicable in the re-ranking setting? The authors test whether consistency checking of generated queries improves results. 

4) RQ4: Can the authors match performance of a large MonoT5-3B ranker using much smaller BERT models? The authors aim to achieve similar performance to the very large MonoT5-3B model using smaller BERT models.

5) RQ5: Can the authors substantially outperform BM25 using a small and fast ranker like MiniLM with 30 million parameters? The goal is to beat the BM25 baseline with a small, efficient neural ranker model.

In summary, the main research questions focus on whether IR capabilities can emerge from unsupervised LLM training, comparing different models for synthetic query generation, techniques to improve synthetic training data, achieving high accuracy with small efficient models compared to very large models, and outperforming the BM25 baseline.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here is a summary of the key contribution of this paper:

This paper proposes InPars-Light, a cost-effective modification of the original InPars method for unsupervised training of neural rankers. The key contributions are:

1. InPars-Light uses only freely available open-source language models like BLOOM instead of proprietary models like GPT-3 used in original InPars. 

2. It employs much smaller neural ranking models (e.g. 30M parameter MiniLM) instead of large multi-billion parameter models in original InPars.

3. It incorporates consistency checking of generated queries, which helps improve training. 

4. Optional all-domain pretraining on queries from all datasets helps boost performance of smaller models. 

5. Re-ranking top 100 candidates instead of 1000 further improves efficiency.

Through experiments on 5 English IR datasets, the paper shows that InPars-Light with a 30M MiniLM consistently and significantly outperforms BM25, unlike the 220M model in original InPars. The 435M DeBERTa model with InPars-Light also matches the accuracy of the much larger 3B model from InPars.

In summary, the key contribution is a highly cost-effective and practical recipe for unsupervised training of accurate neural rankers using open-source models and techniques like consistency checking and all-domain pretraining.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a more cost-effective method called InPars-Light for unsupervised training of neural ranking models using pretrained language models, which can match or exceed the performance of the original InPars approach using much smaller models and less computation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in unsupervised training of neural information retrieval models:

- It focuses on reproducing and extending the recent InPars work by Bonifacio et al. (2022). The authors aim to develop a more cost-effective version of InPars using smaller models and open-source tools. 

- Like InPars, it uses few-shot prompting of large language models to generate synthetic training queries. However, it replaces the proprietary GPT-3 model used in InPars with the open-source BLOOM model. 

- It incorporates consistency checking of generated queries, an idea introduced concurrently in Promptagator (Dai et al., 2022). This helps filter out low-quality examples.

- The proposed InPars-Light method achieves strong results with much smaller models than InPars, like a 30M parameter MiniLM, showing prompt training can work for compact rankers. 

- InPars-Light reaches performance comparable to InPars' large MonoT5 ranker using a 7x smaller DeBERTa model, demonstrating the approach's cost-effectiveness.

- Compared to concurrent work like InPars v2, this study provides a controlled ablation examining model size and comparing GPT-3 to open-source alternatives.

- The technique is evaluated on standard IR benchmark datasets, allowing comparison to BM25 and supervised approaches. Gains over BM25 are shown to be statistically significant.

Overall, this work makes prompt-based unsupervised neural IR training more practical by reducing model size and cost. The controlled experiments help strengthen the evidence that prompting can elicit IR abilities in language models. The consistent improvements over strong baselines demonstrate the usefulness of this method for domain-specific ranking.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring other open-source language models for query generation besides BLOOM and GPT-J. The authors tested only these two models but think other options could also be promising. 

- Investigating why distillation failed to transfer capabilities of larger models like DeBERTa into the smaller MiniLM model. The authors plan to study the reasons for this failure in future work.

- Trying consistency checking with a faster model like MiniLM instead of the slower DeBERTa model that was used. This could help reduce the computational cost of consistency checking.

- Testing different values for the consistency checking parameter k (number of top documents to check) on more datasets beyond just MS MARCO. The authors only optimized this on one dataset so far.

- Evaluating the InPars-Light method on more and diverse datasets to further validate its effectiveness. The current study looked at 5 English datasets.

- Exploring unsupervised domain adaptation as a complementary technique to synthetically generate additional in-domain training data.

- Comparing to other recent related methods like GPL and UPR more thoroughly. The current comparisons are limited.

- Investigating how to further improve effectiveness of small ranking models through techniques like prompt/architecture tuning.

In summary, the main suggestions are to expand to more models, datasets, and techniques while also analyzing the failures to distill and find ways to improve small model performance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a cost-effective and reproducible study of the InPars recipe for unsupervised training of neural rankers. The authors develop a modified approach called InPars-Light that uses only freely available language models like BLOOM and much smaller ranking models. They show that InPars-Light with consistency checking and all-domain pretraining enables even a 30 million parameter MiniLM model to substantially outperform BM25 on all test collections. The authors argue that InPars-Light is more practical than InPars since it uses smaller models for generation and ranking, generates fewer queries, and reranks fewer candidates. The study demonstrates that capabilities for information retrieval can emerge from large-scale pretraining without task-specific supervision, and that open-source models can effectively replace proprietary models like GPT-3 for query generation. Overall, this is the first recipe to enable affordable unsupervised training of neural rankers that surpass BM25.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents InPars-Light, a cost-effective and efficient modification of the InPars method for unsupervised training of neural ranking models. InPars-Light uses open-source language models like BLOOM instead of proprietary models like GPT-3, employs smaller ranking models like MiniLM instead of large models like MonoT5, and re-ranks only 100 candidates instead of 1000. Through experiments on five English IR datasets, the authors show that InPars-Light can match or exceed the performance of InPars while being much more practical. 

Specifically, the authors find that a 435 million parameter DeBERTA model trained with InPars-Light matches the performance of the much larger 3 billion parameter MonoT5 model from InPars on most datasets. More impressively, a tiny 30 million parameter MiniLM model also significantly outperforms the baseline BM25 on all datasets when pre-trained on queries from all collections and fine-tuned on consistency checked in-domain data. Overall, the paper demonstrates that with techniques like consistency checking and all-domain pretraining, InPars-Light enables building high-accuracy but very efficient neural rankers in a purely unsupervised manner. The method is shown to be much more cost-effective than InPars in terms of model size, training time, and inference speed.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a study that aims to reproduce and improve upon the InPars method for unsupervised training of neural rankers introduced by Bonifacio et al. (2022). The authors propose InPars-Light, a more cost-effective modification of InPars that uses the open-source BLOOM language model rather than GPT-3 to generate synthetic training queries, employs smaller BERT-based cross-encoder ranking models with as few as 30 million parameters, and re-ranks only the top 100 candidate documents per query rather than 1000. Key modifications include fine-tuning the models on consistency-checked training data as in Promptagator (Dai et al., 2022) and optional pre-training on queries from all datasets. The authors show that InPars-Light enables even a small 30 million parameter MiniLM model to significantly outperform BM25 on all five English retrieval collections, unlike the original InPars method that required a large 3 billion parameter MonoT5 model to consistently beat BM25. The study demonstrates that prompt-based unsupervised training can be made practical and cost-effective.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents InPars-Light, a cost-effective modification of the InPars method for unsupervised training of neural rankers using large language models (LLMs). InPars-Light uses only freely available LLMs like BLOOM and much smaller ranking models than InPars, which relied on large proprietary models like GPT-3 and MonoT5-3B.
