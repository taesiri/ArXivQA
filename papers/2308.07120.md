# [Mind your Language (Model): Fact-Checking LLMs and their Role in NLP   Research and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07120)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: what are the gaps in our current understanding of large language models (LLMs), and how can we improve research practices to address these gaps? Specifically, the paper examines several main claims about LLMs - that they are robust, achieve state-of-the-art results across tasks, exhibit emergent properties due to scale, etc. - and collects counter-evidence showing that these claims are oversimplified or lack rigorous proof. The authors argue that the ubiquity of LLMs in research has led to homogeneity in approaches, outsized industry influence, lack of reproducibility, and other issues. To address these problems, the paper proposes concrete recommendations, including:- Maintaining diversity in NLP research approaches beyond just LLMs- Clearly defining terminology like "large language model" and "emergent properties"- Avoiding reliance on closed-source models like GPT-4 as benchmarks- Conducting more rigorous studies to understand LLM capabilities and limitations- Developing better evaluation methods that target specific linguistic phenomenaOverall, the central question is: what are the gaps in our knowledge about LLMs, and how can the field improve research practices to systematically investigate these models and mitigate issues like lack of reproducibility? The paper aims to clearly lay out the problems and provide constructive solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is to provide a critical examination of some common claims and assumptions about large language models (LLMs) in NLP research. Specifically, the authors:- Propose a more precise definition of what constitutes an LLM, based on 3 key criteria (models text, receives large-scale pretraining, and relies on transfer learning).- Fact-check and provide counter-evidence against several common claims about LLMs, including that they are robust, achieve state-of-the-art performance across the board, and exhibit "emergent" capabilities. - Discuss how the perceived strengths of LLMs are changing research practices in ways that could be detrimental, such as decreased diversity of approaches, reliance on closed proprietary models, and decreased reproducibility.- Make recommendations for improving future LLM research, such as maintaining diversity of approaches, clearly defining terminology, avoiding closed models as benchmarks, conducting more rigorous studies of LLM capabilities, and developing better evaluation methodology.In summary, the paper aims to inject more rigor, transparency and critical thinking into the research practices and discussions around LLMs in NLP. It questions assumptions and provides a more nuanced perspective on LLMs' capabilities and limitations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper argues that the hype around large language models in NLP is outpacing the evidence, and makes recommendations for more rigorous terminology, experimental studies, evaluation methods, transparency, and diversity of approaches going forward.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on large language models (LLMs):- Scope and approach: This paper takes a broad look at the impact of LLMs on the field of NLP, identifying common claims, assumptions, and knowledge gaps. Many other papers focus more narrowly, such as evaluating a specific LLM or proposing a new technique. The critical perspective of examining assumptions is less common.- Use of evidence: The authors draw on a wide range of prior work to support their analysis, including empirical studies, benchmark results, and socio-technical critiques. This balances both quantitative performance data and qualitative concerns. Some LLM papers focus mostly on benchmark results.  - Discussion of terminology: The paper argues for more precise terminology like "large language model" and "emergent properties", while much of the LLM literature uses these terms loosely. Clarifying terminology is an important contribution.- Consideration of research culture: The paper connects trends in LLM research to changes in the broader NLP research culture, like increased industry influence and decreased reproducibility. This level of critique and analysis of the research ecosystem is rare.- Forward-looking: While many papers focus narrowly on a new technique or model, this paper takes a forward-looking stance by identifying knowledge gaps and making recommendations for future research. The suggestions around evaluation, transparency, and research diversity are constructive.Overall, I would say this paper provides a uniquely broad, evidence-based, and critical perspective compared to much of the existing literature on LLMs. The attention to research culture and recommendations for improving rigor help move the field forward. More papers adopting this kind of reflective, holistic view could be beneficial.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several research directions going forward:- Maintaining diversity of research approaches in NLP - They advocate for keeping a healthy diversity of approaches and tasks in NLP research, not just focusing on LLMs. This includes having dedicated conference tracks and fair reviews for non-mainstream work.- Defining terminology clearly - The authors point out the lack of clarity around terms like "large language model" and "emergent properties". They suggest researchers be more precise when using terminology related to their domain of expertise. - Avoiding closed-source models as baselines - The authors recommend not relying on proprietary closed-source models like GPT-4 as benchmarks, as this puts researchers without API access at a disadvantage. They suggest using open models instead.- More rigorous studies of LLM functionality - The authors call for more rigorous, controlled studies to address knowledge gaps around what makes LLMs effective for different tasks, their brittleness, emergent properties, etc. Large-scale benchmarks are insufficient for this.- Developing better evaluation methodology - The authors advocate developing evaluation methods that target specific linguistic phenomena, carefully explore model decision boundaries, control for confounds, and link outputs to training data evidence. This requires going beyond metrics like perplexity.- Improving transparency and reproducibility - The authors argue for higher standards for transparency and reproducibility when studying LLMs, given existing issues.In summary, the main suggested directions are maintaining research diversity, improving definitions and evaluation rigor, avoiding proprietary model baselines, and conducting more controlled studies to address knowledge gaps around LLMs. The overall goal is more scientific rigor in LLM research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper argues that the term "large language model" (LLM) lacks a clear definition, and that many claims about LLM capabilities lack rigorous evidence. The authors propose three criteria for a model to count as an LLM: it models text generation, receives large-scale pretraining, and relies on transfer learning. They then fact-check common claims that LLMs are robust, achieve state-of-the-art performance, owe their success to scale, and exhibit "emergent" capabilities. The authors argue these claims encourage research homogeneity, industry influence, decreased reproducibility, and de-democratization in NLP. They recommend maintaining diversity in research approaches, clearly defining key terms like "LLM", avoiding reliance on proprietary models, and developing more rigorous studies and evaluation methods for LLMs. Overall, the paper calls for more rigor, transparency and diversity in LLM research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper provides a critical analysis of the hype and assumptions around Large Language Models (LLMs) in NLP research. The authors first propose more precise criteria for defining what constitutes an LLM: the ability to model and generate text, large-scale pretraining, and adaptable transfer learning. They then fact-check common claims about LLMs, arguing that they are not necessarily state-of-the-art or robust, their success is not just due to scale, and their "emergent" abilities likely come from training data. The dominance of LLM research is changing NLP towards homogeneity, industry influence, decreased reproducibility, and lack of theory. Going forward, the authors recommend maintaining diversity in NLP research, clearly defining key terms, avoiding closed-source models as baselines, more rigorous studies of LLMs, and better evaluation methodology.  In summary, this paper argues that the NLP community needs more precision and skepticism around claims of LLM capabilities. While acknowledging their success, the authors advocate for not treating them as a silver bullet and maintaining openness to other approaches. They provide concrete suggestions for how researchers can improve rigor and transparency around LLMs. The main message is that there are still major gaps in our understanding of these models that need to be addressed through careful empirical studies.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in the paper is a literature review and analysis of existing research on large language models (LLMs). The authors do not present new experimental results, but instead conduct a critical examination of common claims and assumptions about LLMs in recent research. Specifically, the paper reviews the definition of LLMs, highlighting the lack of clarity around this term. It then fact checks and provides counter-evidence for several prevalent ideas about LLMs: that they are robust, achieve state-of-the-art performance, exhibit "emergent" properties due to their scale, and so on. The authors synthesize evidence both from empirical studies as well as conceptual critiques of LLMs. Based on this analysis, the paper reflects on how the rise of LLMs has impacted the theory and practice of NLP research. The authors conclude by proposing ways forward, including maintaining diversity in research approaches, improving evaluation methodology, and conducting more rigorous studies of LLM functionality. Overall, the main method is a comprehensive literature review and critical analysis aimed at identifying gaps in knowledge about LLMs and misconceptions in how they are studied.
