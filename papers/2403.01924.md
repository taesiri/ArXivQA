# [To Generate or to Retrieve? On the Effectiveness of Artificial Contexts   for Medical Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01924)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Medical open-domain question answering is challenging as it requires deep domain knowledge and reasoning skills. Recently there has been a shift from closed-book models that rely solely on their parameters, to open-book models that consult external knowledge sources.  

- Two paradigms have emerged: retrieve-then-read relies on retrieving relevant contexts from knowledge bases to augment the input, while generate-then-read involves generating custom contexts tailored to the specific questions using a medical language model. There is debate around which approach is more effective.

Proposed Solution  
- This paper introduces MedGENIE, the first generate-then-read framework for medical open-domain QA. It uses a medical LLM to generate multi-view artificial contexts conditioned on the question and candidate answers. The contexts are provided as input to augment generalist LLMs via in-context learning or small finetuned models.

- To promote efficiency, MedGENIE operates under a limited compute budget of 24GB VRAM and tests reader models â‰¤250M parameters.

Main Contributions
- MedGENIE establishes new SOTA results on MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA and MMLU medical QA benchmarks, outperforming even massive 175B parametric models.

- It demonstrates superior accuracy with generated contexts over retrieved counterparts across benchmarks. The contexts are also preferred by a reranking model, confirming their relevance.

- When combined with retrieved contexts, the generated ones further boost performance, advocating for their symbiosis.

- Overall, MedGENIE effectively tackles limitations of scale, knowledge and hardware resources in medical QA, providing both high accuracy and accessibility. The findings reveal the potential of leveraging modern medical LLMs to automatically construct informative contexts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces MedGENIE, the first generate-then-read framework for medical open-domain question answering, which uses a medical language model to generate multi-view artificial contexts tailored to questions that are then used to ground generalist language models or fine-tuned small models, achieving state-of-the-art results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces MedGENIE, the first fully generative framework for multiple-choice medical question answering. It studies the effectiveness of grounding language models on artificial contexts generated by a medical LLM for answering questions, rather than relying on retrieved contexts from knowledge bases. The key findings are:

1) MedGENIE allows small language models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple medical QA benchmarks, outperforming even huge closed-book LLMs with billions of parameters. 

2) The generated contexts are more effective than retrieved counterparts from sources like Wikipedia and PubMed in boosting QA performance. They also enhance existing retrieve-then-read pipelines when combined with retrieved contexts.

3) MedGENIE delivers strong performance while assuming low-resource settings - a maximum of 24GB VRAM. This makes it easily accessible.

In summary, MedGENIE pioneers the generate-then-read paradigm for medical QA, demonstrating the value of artificial contexts over retrieved ones, and their ability to empower small models to attain high accuracy akin to massive LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What were the key motivations and objectives behind developing the MedGENIE framework for medical open-domain question answering? How does it aim to address limitations of prior approaches?

2. Why does the paper argue that generating artificial contexts is preferable to retrieving passages from external corpora in many cases? What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of each approach?  

3. Could you explain in detail the multi-view context generation methodology used in MedGENIE? What is the purpose of having both option-focused and option-free contexts?

4. How does in-context learning allow MedGENIE to equip large language models with specialized medical knowledge without expensive fine-tuning? What are the tradeoffs compared to supervised fine-tuning?

5. What encoding and decoding strategies does MedGENIE use for the reader models, and why were they selected? How do they differ for LLMs versus SLMs?

6. Why does MedGENIE incorporate both a generate-then-read and a retrieve-then-read component? In what ways do they complement each other? Could a hybrid approach further improve performance?

7. How robust is MedGENIE in terms of sensitivity to question subject, option order, choice of medical LLM for context generation, and other factors? Are there still limitations regarding model stability?  

8. Does MedGENIE exhibit any inherent biases or factuality issues due to its reliance on synthetic contexts? If so, how might these be detected and mitigated?

9. Could MedGENIE be extended to other domains beyond medicine? Would the same framework and design choices remain effective, or would modifications be necessitated?

10. What are the most promising future research directions for improving MedGENIE? For example, using LLM ensembles for context generation, iterative refinement, enhanced factuality filtering, etc.
