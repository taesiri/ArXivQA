# [DiffusionMTL: Learning Multi-Task Denoising Diffusion Model from   Partially Annotated Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15389)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent work has defined an important new problem - Multi-Task Partially Supervised Learning (MTPSL) for dense scene understanding. In MTPSL, each training image only has labels for a subset of tasks rather than all the tasks. This leads to noisy and low-quality predictions from models due to the sparsity of training labels. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel multi-task denoising diffusion framework called DiffusionMTL to tackle the issue of noisy predictions. The key ideas are:

(1) Reformulate the MTPSL problem as a pixel-level denoising problem. Model the task prediction maps as following a noisy distribution and aim to recover the clean distribution. 

(2) Design a Multi-Task Denoising Diffusion Network (MTDNet) with two components: (i) A diffusion process that gradually adds noise to the initial prediction maps. (ii) A denoising process to remove the noise in a step-by-step manner using a designed Denoiser module and obtain rectified predictions.

(3) Further introduce two orthogonal diffusion mechanisms focusing on different signals - Prediction Diffusion (on output space) and Feature Diffusion (on feature space).

(4) Propose a Multi-Task Conditioning strategy to exploit cross-task consistency in the denoising process. The denoiser takes a shared Multi-Task Condition Feature, which provides extra guidance for denoising a target task.

Main Contributions:
(1) First work to model MTPSL as a multi-task denoising problem and propose a diffusion framework.

(2) Design an innovative Multi-Task Denoising Diffusion Network with Prediction & Feature Diffusion mechanisms and Multi-Task Conditioning strategy.

(3) Achieve superior performance over state-of-the-arts on three datasets under two MTPSL settings, demonstrating the efficacy of modeling and rectifying noise in MTPSL.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in introducing diffusion models to the MTPSL problem and using denoising objectives to enhance prediction quality. The proposed DiffusionMTL framework with specialized designs sets a new state-of-the-art for this practical problem.
