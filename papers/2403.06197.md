# [DrFuse: Learning Disentangled Representation for Clinical Multi-Modal   Fusion with Missing Modality and Modal Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Integrating electronic health records (EHR) and medical images like chest x-rays (CXR) can improve clinical predictions, but has two key challenges:
    1) Missing modalities: CXR images are often unavailable due to clinical/administrative reasons.
    2) Modal inconsistency: EHR and CXR can provide inconsistent or even contradictory predictions for some patients and diseases.

Proposed Solution: 
- A new model called "DrFuse" that learns disentangled representations from EHR and CXR to enable effective fusion even with missing modalities and modal inconsistency.

Key Ideas:
- Disentangle shared and distinct representations from each modality. Align shared ones using logit pooling and Jensen-Shannon divergence to enable handling missing modalities.
- Use a disease-aware attention module to compute patient- and disease-specific weights for EHR vs CXR to address inconsistency. Ranking loss enforces attention weights to match prediction capabilities.  

Contributions:
- Handles missing modalities via aligned shared representations from disentanglement. Still works if only EHR available.
- Captures patient-specific significance of modalities for each disease to address inconsistency issue.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MIMIC-IV dataset for disease prediction.
- Publicly available implementation.

In summary, DrFuse introduces disentangled representation learning and disease-aware attention fusion to enable robust clinical prediction from multi-modal EHR and medical imaging data even with missing modalities and cross-modality inconsistency.
