# [Uncertainty in Graph Neural Networks: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Uncertainty in Graph Neural Networks: A Survey":

Problem:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various real-world applications. However, predictive uncertainty in GNNs stemming from diverse sources such as inherent randomness in data and model training errors can lead to unstable and erroneous predictions. Therefore, identifying, quantifying, and utilizing uncertainty is essential to enhance model performance, prediction reliability and trustworthiness of GNNs across different downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a three-stage framework to systematically review GNNs from the perspective of uncertainty:

1) Identify sources of uncertainty in GNNs. Uncertainty mainly comes from two sources - aleatoric uncertainty due to inherent randomness in data, and epistemic uncertainty due to lack of knowledge of the model. 

2) Quantify uncertainty in GNNs using methods based on single deterministic models, single models with random parameters, and ensemble models. Various metrics are used to evaluate these models regarding different targeted uncertainty sources.

3) Utilize the captured uncertainty to improve downstream tasks such as node selection, anomaly detection, model enhancement, and model trustworthiness. 

Main Contributions:
- Provides a holistic view to connect uncertainty theory, quantification methods and practical usage across different GNN communities 
- Summarizes and compares existing graph uncertainty theories and methods
- Reviews and structures literature on incorporating uncertainty estimation into representative graph learning tasks
- Discusses real-world GNN applications utilizing uncertainty
- Provides insights and promising future directions in the area of GNN uncertainty

In summary, this is the first comprehensive survey that focuses specifically on uncertainty in GNNs. It links the gap between theory and practice, and connects different GNN sub-communities working across uncertainty identification, quantification and utilization.
