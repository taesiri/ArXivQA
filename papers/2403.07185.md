# [Uncertainty in Graph Neural Networks: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Uncertainty in Graph Neural Networks: A Survey":

Problem:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various real-world applications. However, predictive uncertainty in GNNs stemming from diverse sources such as inherent randomness in data and model training errors can lead to unstable and erroneous predictions. Therefore, identifying, quantifying, and utilizing uncertainty is essential to enhance model performance, prediction reliability and trustworthiness of GNNs across different downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a three-stage framework to systematically review GNNs from the perspective of uncertainty:

1) Identify sources of uncertainty in GNNs. Uncertainty mainly comes from two sources - aleatoric uncertainty due to inherent randomness in data, and epistemic uncertainty due to lack of knowledge of the model. 

2) Quantify uncertainty in GNNs using methods based on single deterministic models, single models with random parameters, and ensemble models. Various metrics are used to evaluate these models regarding different targeted uncertainty sources.

3) Utilize the captured uncertainty to improve downstream tasks such as node selection, anomaly detection, model enhancement, and model trustworthiness. 

Main Contributions:
- Provides a holistic view to connect uncertainty theory, quantification methods and practical usage across different GNN communities 
- Summarizes and compares existing graph uncertainty theories and methods
- Reviews and structures literature on incorporating uncertainty estimation into representative graph learning tasks
- Discusses real-world GNN applications utilizing uncertainty
- Provides insights and promising future directions in the area of GNN uncertainty

In summary, this is the first comprehensive survey that focuses specifically on uncertainty in GNNs. It links the gap between theory and practice, and connects different GNN sub-communities working across uncertainty identification, quantification and utilization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper on uncertainty in graph neural networks:

1. This paper categorizes uncertainty quantification methods into three main classes: single deterministic models, single models with random parameters, and ensemble models. Can you explain the key differences between these three classes of methods, especially in how they model uncertainty? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each?

2. The paper discusses Bayesian-based and frequentist-based approaches as two ways single deterministic models can estimate uncertainty. How do these two statistical approaches differ fundamentally? What types of prior assumptions do Bayesian methods make? How does this impact how they model epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty?

3. Ensemble models are stated to provide more accurate predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates than single models. What are some reasons for this? How do ensembles capture uncertainty compared to the other methods discussed? What are some of the main challenges in applying ensemble methods to graph neural networks?

4. The paper emphasizes the importance of identifying and modeling different types of graph-related uncertainty such as node-level, edge-level and graph-level uncertainty. Can you expand on some examples of specific forms of structural uncertainty that can arise at each of these levels in graph data? 

5. One of the future works suggested is exploring finer-grained types of distributional uncertainty for graphs, e.g. shifts in node features vs graph topology. Why is decomposing distributional uncertainty important? How could quantifying these distinct forms of distribution shift aid in out-of-distribution detection tasks?

6. What evaluation metrics are proposed in the paper for assessing the quality of uncertainty quantification methods? What are some of the key challenges and limitations in evaluating uncertainty estimation methods? 

7. Active learning and self-training are two tasks involving node selection where uncertainty is widely used as a selection criterion. How exactly is uncertainty measured and utilized for node selection in these graph learning tasks? What are some other criteria that can be combined with estimated uncertainty?

8. How is uncertainty quantification used to enhance model robustness against adversarial attacks on graphs? Explain the common approach employed and discuss its limitations. What are some promising ways uncertainty could alternatively be leveraged to improve robustness?

9. For real-world applications like traffic prediction or drug discovery, what practical desiderata should be considered when selecting uncertainty quantification methods for graph neural networks? Expand on efficiency, ease of implementation, types of uncertainty captured etc.

10. The paper identifies explaining graph neural network predictions as an application area for uncertainty. How exactly can estimated uncertainty provide insights into the reliability of predictions? Discuss the use of mutual information and other relevant measures. What are limitations of current methods?
