# [Modelling Commonsense Commonalities with Multi-Facet Concept Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Concept embeddings are useful for injecting commonsense knowledge into downstream tasks. Their purpose is often to identify "commonalities", i.e. sets of concepts that share some property of interest. This allows for inductive generalization.
- However, standard concept embeddings primarily reflect basic taxonomic categories. They fail to capture more specific commonsense properties related to aspects like color, taste, purpose, etc. 

Proposed Solution:
- Learn multi-facet concept embeddings to capture a more diverse range of commonsense properties. 
- Use ChatGPT to obtain training data of (property, facet) pairs, e.g. (yellow, color), (sweet, taste). This frames the problem as supervised learning.
- Propose a bi-encoder model with 3 BERT encoders: 
   1) Map concepts to embeddings
   2) Map properties to embeddings
   3) Map properties to embeddings of corresponding facets
- Facets are treated as masks on the concept embeddings rather than separate concept representations. This allows modeling facet hierarchies and concept-specific facets.

Main Contributions:
- Method to obtain facet supervision from ChatGPT
- Bi-encoder concept embedding model with explicit facet representations
- Experiments across 4 tasks:
   1) Property prediction: Substantially outperforms baselines
   2) Outlier detection: Captures more fine-grained commonalities
   3) Ontology completion: New SOTA results
   4) Ultra-fine entity typing: Improves on prior work

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to learn multi-facet concept embeddings in a supervised manner using ChatGPT. Experiments demonstrate that modeling facets allows capturing a wider range of commonalities, leading to consistent improvements across multiple knowledge-intensive tasks.
