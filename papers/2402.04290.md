# [CasCast: Skillful High-resolution Precipitation Nowcasting via Cascaded   Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Precipitation nowcasting based on radar data is essential for weather prediction and disaster management. However, there are two key challenges that existing methods have not solved well: (1) Accurately modeling the evolution of complex precipitation systems involving different scales - the mesoscale system with stable large-scale motion, and the small-scale system with high randomness. (2) Effectively forecasting extreme precipitation events, which requires predicting small-scale patterns at high resolution.

Method:
This paper proposes CasCast, a cascaded framework with a deterministic model to predict the mesoscale precipitation distribution, and a generative model to generate small-scale patterns. Specifically:

(1) A deterministic model takes past radar observations to predict a blurry future forecast representing the overall precipitation motion. 

(2) The blurry forecast and past observations are encoded into a latent space and input to CasFormer, a diffusion-based transformer conditioned on frame-wise guidance for generating future small-scale details.

(3) CasFormer conducts iterative sampling in the latent space to output the final high-resolution probabilistic forecast.

Main Contributions:

(1) CasCast disentangles precipitation nowcasting into predicting mesoscale distribution and generating small-scale patterns, which better handles the multiscale nature of precipitation systems.

(2) CasFormer incorporates frame-wise guidance and works in a low-dimensional latent space to enable effective optimization and generation of high-resolution extreme precipitation events.

(3) Experiments on three radar datasets demonstrate CasCast's superior performance over state-of-the-arts, especially for forecasting regional extreme precipitation (up to +91.8% better). The framework also shows strong robustness and generalizability.

In summary, this paper proposes an innovative cascaded modeling approach to address key limitations of existing precipitation nowcasting methods regarding multiscale modeling and extreme event forecasting. The extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and versatility of the framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas in this paper:

This paper proposes CasCast, a cascaded framework that decouples mesoscale and small-scale precipitation nowcasting via a deterministic model and a frame-wise guided diffusion transformer to achieve skillful high-resolution forecasts with accurate global motion, realistic local patterns, and improved regional extreme event prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes CasCast, a novel cascaded framework for precipitation nowcasting that decouples the prediction into a deterministic part that forecasts the global precipitation distribution and a probabilistic part that generates small-scale weather phenomena. The key contributions are:

1) CasCast disentangles precipitation nowcasting into simpler tasks of predicting the high-deterministic mesoscale motion and generating local patterns based on the prediction, allowing it to model complex multiscale precipitation systems. 

2) To enable prediction of extreme precipitation events, CasCast trains the cascaded framework at high resolution and develops a frame-wise guided diffusion transformer (CasFormer) in a low-dimensional latent space. This allows better optimization and reduced computational costs.

3) Experiments on three benchmark radar precipitation datasets show CasCast achieves competitive performance, especially for regional extreme precipitation nowcasting where it significantly outperforms baselines by up to 91.8%.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel cascaded framework CasCast that decouples the multiscale modeling and enables skillful high-resolution forecasting of both global precipitation distributions and local extreme events.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a cascaded framework composed of a deterministic model and a probabilistic model. What is the motivation behind using this cascaded approach instead of just a standalone deterministic or probabilistic model? How does it help with modeling the multi-scale nature of precipitation systems?

2. CasFormer is proposed in the paper for the probabilistic part of the framework. How is the frame-wise guidance used in CasFormer helpful for optimizing the diffusion process? What challenges does it address compared to sequence-level diffusion transformers? 

3. The paper uses a pretrained autoencoder to obtain latent representations before feeding into CasFormer. What is the rationale behind using latent representations instead of raw radar data? What tradeoffs does it present in terms of distortion versus computation?

4. What modifications need to be made to the current framework if one wants to adapt it to a new geographical region with different terrain and climate? Would it require full retraining or can some components be reused/transferred?

5. The extreme precipitation forecasting performance is highlighted in the paper. Why is accurate extreme precipitation forecasting important? And why is the current method able to significantly outperform baselines on this metric?

6. Can you analyze the complexity (computation, memory etc.) of CasCast and compare it with standalone deterministic and standalone probabilistic baselines? Where does most of the complexity arise from?

7. The diffusion model is preferred over GANs as the probabilistic model. What advantages does the diffusion model provide over GAN based approaches? How sensitive is the performance to different noise schedules and sampling strategies?

8. What metrics are used to evaluate the precipitation forecasts? Why is using multiple metrics with different pooling operations important to assess different aspects of performance?

9. How robust is CasCast when tested across different radar echo datasets in terms of reusability? Does it require full retraining or fine-tuning of specific components?

10. What can be potential negative societal impacts if the precipitation forecasts from the model turn out to be inaccurate in certain cases? And how can those risks be mitigated?
