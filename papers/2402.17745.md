# [LoDIP: Low light phase retrieval with deep image prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) is used for high-resolution imaging at the nanoscale in applications like materials science and biology. However, many samples are sensitive to radiation damage, necessitating low-dose imaging.  
- Standard CDI methods struggle with phase retrieval under the high shot noise present in low-dose measurements. Prior solutions either modify the optical setup to use multiple measurements or leverage deep learning but have limitations in working for single-image phase retrieval.

Method:
- The paper proposes LoDIP, combining ideas from in-situ CDI (using a static high-dose region alongside the sample) with deep image prior framework (using an untrained neural network as a prior). 

- LoDIP acquires a diffraction pattern with a static structure to increase light while keeping dose low on sample. The static structure is reconstructed and used to constrain the phase retrieval of the sample.

- An untrained neural network parameterizes the sample reconstruction. Additional constraints like support, relative illumination intensities, and scaling are incorporated.

Contributions:
- LoDIP performs single-image phase retrieval by effectively combining experimental and computational ideas. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods like HIO and GPS for simulated and experimental datasets.

- It achieves higher quality reconstructions especially in low-dose conditions in terms of metrics like PSNR, SSIM while preserving resolution (comparable FRC).

- Unlike other deep learning methods, it does not need a large training set and works across different sample types. Easy to modify for different experimental settings.

In summary, the paper makes useful contributions in enabling reliable nanoscale imaging under low-dose conditions by combining ideas from optical setup design and untrained neural priors.
