## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper content, the main contribution appears to be proposing a deep learning based model that uses 1D representations of targets and drugs for predicting drug-target binding affinity. Specifically, the paper describes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model protein sequences and compound representations, and shows this is an effective approach for the drug target binding affinity prediction task. The key novelty highlighted is the use of 1D target and drug representations with CNNs.
