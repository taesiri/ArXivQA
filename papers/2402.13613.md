# [Overview of the VLSP 2023 -- ComOM Shared Task: A Data Challenge for   Comparative Opinion Mining from Vietnamese Product Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13613)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper introduces the Comparative Opinion Mining from Vietnamese Product Reviews (ComOM) shared task, held as part of VLSP 2023 workshop. 
- The goal is to develop techniques to extract "quintuples" (Subject, Object, Aspect, Predicate, Comparison Type Label) from comparative sentences in Vietnamese product reviews. 
- This is an important but challenging NLP task, and there has been limited prior work on comparative opinion mining for Vietnamese.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct a new dataset called VCOM with 120 documents and 2468 comparative opinions annotated with quintuples.
- They define a standardized task format and comprehensive set of evaluation metrics. 
- Baseline models consisting of a Pipeline model and Generative model are provided.
- Participating teams develop their own models aiming to extract quintuples and are evaluated on an unseen test set.

Key Outcomes:
- 20 teams with 48 registered members from universities and industry participated.
- The best performing system achieved 23.73% F1 score on exact match macro-averaged quintuple metric, surpassing the Generative baseline.
- 11 teams exceeded the Pipeline baseline, showing promising progress.  
- The new VCOM dataset and evaluation framework will facilitate future research on this task.

In summary, this paper introduced a novel shared task to promote comparative opinion mining research for Vietnamese, provided new annotated data and baselines, and obtained initial encouraging results through an open challenge that attracted active participation.
