# [Benchmarking Continual Learning from Cognitive Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03309)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes desiderata (desired capabilities) for continual learning models based on cognitive properties that support human lifelong learning. The desiderata include adaptability (the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks while retaining old knowledge), sensitivity (the ability to identify relationships between tasks), and efficiency (minimal memory usage and training time). The authors design comprehensive evaluation protocols to assess whether state-of-the-art continual learning models satisfy these desiderata. Experiments across eight benchmarks show that no existing method fulfills all desiderata. While some methods exhibit adaptability and efficiency to an extent, none can effectively handle long task sequences or identify task relationships to achieve an optimal balance between learning similarities and differences across tasks. The authors discuss factors influencing model performance and provide guidance for improving continual learning models, such as developing adaptive solutions that can reach equilibrium states in dynamic environments, using graph neural networks to explicitly model evolving task relationships, and achieving better efficiency-performance trade-offs. Overall, this work establishes desiderata grounded in cognitive science to characterize the capabilities required for human-like continual learning, demonstrates current methods' limitations, and offers perspectives to inspire future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes cognitive desiderata and a systemic evaluation paradigm for assessing continual learning methods, revealing that current methods fail to identify dynamic task relationships or achieve strong adaptability and efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing desiderata (requirements) for continual learning models derived from neurocognitive theories. These desiderata include adaptability, sensitivity, and efficiency.

2. Proposing a systemic and comprehensive evaluation paradigm composed of protocols designed to assess the performance of continual learning methods with respect to the desiderata from a cognitive perspective. 

3. Conducting experiments across eight benchmarks to reveal that no existing method satisfies all the desiderata. The experiments analyze the strengths and weaknesses of methods regarding different desiderata. 

4. Discussing possible factors influencing model performance on different desiderata and providing guidance for improving continual learning models based on the experimental findings.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new evaluation paradigm and protocols for continual learning methods based on cognitive desiderata, along with experiments and analysis to examine state-of-the-art methods from this new perspective. The goal is to provide a more comprehensive framework to assess if and how well methods realize human-like continual learning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Continual learning - The core problem of enabling machine learning models to continuously learn over time from a stream of data distributions without forgetting previously learned knowledge.

- Desiderata - The criteria or requirements proposed that continual learning models should fulfill, derived from theories of human learning. The three desiderata proposed are adaptability, sensitivity, and efficiency.

- Adaptability - The ability of a model to rapidly transfer knowledge to new tasks while retaining knowledge about old tasks, measured by accuracy across tasks and backward transfer.

- Sensitivity - The ability of a model to identify relationships between tasks and handle different types of task variations, including different continual learning scenarios and varying task granularity.  

- Efficiency - The memory usage and time efficiency of a model during continual learning. Measured by performance with different replay buffer sizes and number of training epochs.

- Evaluation protocols - The model-agnostic ways of evaluating continual learning methods proposed with respect to each of the desiderata.

- Regularization-based methods - Methods that constrain model updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting, such as EWC and SI. 

- Replay methods - Methods that store or generate samples from previous tasks to replay when learning new tasks, such as iCaRL, A-GEM and GSS.

- Dynamic architectures - Methods that allocate separate model capacities to different tasks, such as HAT.

In summary, the key ideas focus on proposing desiderata and evaluation protocols for continual learning based on theories of human learning, and analyzing a range of existing methods with respect to these.
