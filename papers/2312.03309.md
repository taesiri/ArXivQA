# [Benchmarking Continual Learning from Cognitive Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03309)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes desiderata (desired capabilities) for continual learning models based on cognitive properties that support human lifelong learning. The desiderata include adaptability (the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks while retaining old knowledge), sensitivity (the ability to identify relationships between tasks), and efficiency (minimal memory usage and training time). The authors design comprehensive evaluation protocols to assess whether state-of-the-art continual learning models satisfy these desiderata. Experiments across eight benchmarks show that no existing method fulfills all desiderata. While some methods exhibit adaptability and efficiency to an extent, none can effectively handle long task sequences or identify task relationships to achieve an optimal balance between learning similarities and differences across tasks. The authors discuss factors influencing model performance and provide guidance for improving continual learning models, such as developing adaptive solutions that can reach equilibrium states in dynamic environments, using graph neural networks to explicitly model evolving task relationships, and achieving better efficiency-performance trade-offs. Overall, this work establishes desiderata grounded in cognitive science to characterize the capabilities required for human-like continual learning, demonstrates current methods' limitations, and offers perspectives to inspire future research.
