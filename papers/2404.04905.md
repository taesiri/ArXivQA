# [Review for Handling Missing Data with special missing mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of methods for handling missing data, with a particular focus on special missing mechanisms and imputation techniques for tabular data. 

The paper first introduces key concepts related to missing data, including missing rates, patterns, and mechanisms. It then explains the three main missing mechanisms - Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not at Random (MNAR). MAR and MNAR are referred to as "special missing mechanisms" and require more complex handling compared to MCAR.  

The paper categorizes existing methods into deletion methods, imputation methods, and representation learning methods. The review mainly focuses on imputation techniques, which aim to fill in missing values while preserving data integrity. Within imputation methods, statistical approaches, machine learning models, neural networks, and optimization algorithms are covered. Representative techniques from each category are analyzed in detail regarding their ability to handle special missing mechanisms across different data types.

A central finding is that most existing works concentrate primarily on MCAR data instead of more intricate MAR and MNAR cases. The paper hence strongly advocates increased research attention on special missing mechanisms. It also notes a lack of standardized missing data generation methods for MAR and MNAR in past literature, hindering fair evaluation and comparison between techniques.  

To advance the field, the paper makes three main contributions - (1) Comprehensively reviewing methods tailored for special missing mechanisms, especially neural network-based approaches suitable for large, complex data (2) Summarizing different missing data generation techniques from literature (3) Providing future research directions such as extending methods to handle multi-mechanism data, benchmarking, and incorporating domain knowledge.

Overall, this extensive review serves as a valuable resource for researchers by consolidating knowledge on special missing mechanisms, analyzing suitable deep learning-based imputation methods across data types, and laying out impactful areas for further exploration. The paper ultimately aims to promote the adoption of effective missing data handling techniques in diverse real-world applications.
