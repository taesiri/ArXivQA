# [Regression with Multi-Expert Deferral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19494)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Learning to defer predictions to multiple experts is important in many applications, but existing approaches focus on classification tasks. Regression presents unique challenges due to the continuous label space.
- Existing classification approaches like score-based formulations don't apply to regression. There is a need for new methods tailored to regression with deferral to multiple experts.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a novel predictor-rejector formulation for regression with deferral to multiple experts.
- Derive new single-stage and two-stage surrogate losses with strong consistency guarantees. These apply to arbitrary bounded regression losses, accommodate label and instance dependent costs, and multiple experts.
- The formulation includes recent regression with abstention work as a special case.
- Direct minimization of the losses gives new principled deferral algorithms.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis and new algorithms for regression with deferral to multiple experts. 
- Versatile framework addressing key practical issues - supporting multiple experts, instance and label dependent costs, pre-trained predictors, etc.
- Strong consistency guarantees for the surrogate losses. Established as better than Bayes consistency.
- Empirical evaluation showing the effectiveness of the algorithms on real-world datasets.
- Foundation for future research on deferral methods in both regression and classification settings.

In summary, this paper tackles the novel and challenging problem of regression with deferral through a principled predictor-rejector approach. The proposed formulations are general and lead to algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees as well as empirical performance.
