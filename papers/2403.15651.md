# [GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15651)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing inverse rendering techniques for scenes captured with a co-located camera and flashlight can reconstruct geometry of individual objects well, but fail for multi-object scenes. This is because effects like near-field illumination (different objects receive different brightness from the flashlight) and global illumination (interreflections between objects) become much more prominent in multi-object scenes. Prior methods like IRON and WildLight do not model these effects robustly.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a two-stage neural inverse rendering approach called GaNI that can reconstruct high-quality geometry and reflectance for multi-object scenes captured with a co-located camera and flashlight:

Stage 1: Reconstruct geometry using an improved neural volumetric rendering approach based on NeuS. It implicitly models near-field effects by conditioning radiance on distance to the flashlight. It also uses a surface angle weighting loss to handle strong specularities.

Stage 2: Extract reflectance using a neural surface rendering approach based on InvNeRAD. A light position-aware radiance cache is proposed to handle the moving flashlight. A roughness regularization loss is added to prevent noise.

Main Contributions:

1) Implicitly model near-field illumination in the radiance field to enable geometry reconstruction under varying brightness

2) Surface angle weighting loss to reduce impact of specularities during geometry optimization

3) Light position-aware radiance cache to enable modeling of global illumination under a moving flashlight 

4) Roughness regularization to prevent noise in areas with imperfect geometry

5) Evaluations showing the approach reconstructs better geometry and reflectance compared to prior arts like IRON and WildLight for multi-object scenes. It also enables co-located capture to achieve better results than ambient or natural illumination.
