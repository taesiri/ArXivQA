- Partial LoRA applies additional LoRA parameters only to image tokens, preserving language model integrity.
- Curates high-quality, diverse pretraining data for general semantic alignment, world knowledge alignment and vision capability enhancement.  
- Supervised fine-tuning incorporates multi-task training on various QA datasets and free-form text-image composition on in-house data.

Main Contributions:
- Significantly advances text-image composition capabilities to handle complex instructions and customization.
- Sets new SOTA benchmarks on multiple multimodal understanding tasks, outperforming existing models.
- Matches or exceeds performance of GPT-4V and Gemini Pro APIs on several assessments.  
- Partial LoRA effectively balances language and vision capabilities.
- High quality, diverse pretraining data collection method. 
- Publicly released InternLM-XComposer2 model enables customizable content creation.

In summary, the paper presents a cutting-edge technique for long-form text-image generation and comprehension that has both research and practical impact. The unique Partial LoRA design and pretraining methodology enable the model to excel on benchmarks while keeping language model integrity.
