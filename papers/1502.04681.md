# [Unsupervised Learning of Video Representations using LSTMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04681)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we learn good video representations in an unsupervised manner using recurrent neural networks?More specifically, the authors explore using LSTM encoder-decoder models to learn representations of video sequences in an unsupervised way. The key questions and goals include:- What recurrent neural network architectures are most effective for learning useful video representations without supervision? They explore autoencoder models, future prediction models, and composite models.- How do different design choices like conditional vs unconditional decoders affect the learned representations?- Can the learned representations capture useful structure like motion and appearance information to allow tasks like reconstructing inputs and predicting future frames?- Do the learned features transfer to improve performance on supervised tasks like action recognition, especially when training data is limited?- How do the learned models perform on longer timescales vs what they were trained on? Can they generalize? - What do the learned input and output features look like? Can we interpret what is being represented?So in summary, the key research question is around developing and analyzing recurrent neural network models that can learn spatiotemporal representations from video in an unsupervised manner, and using the learned features to improve video understanding tasks. The models, objectives, architectures and analyses are focused on this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing unsupervised models based on LSTMs for learning useful video representations. Specifically:- The paper proposes and compares several LSTM-based models for unsupervised learning on videos, including an autoencoder, a future predictor, and a composite model combining both objectives. - The learned representations are analyzed qualitatively by visualizing model reconstructions, predictions, and features. The models are able to generate persistent motions beyond the timescales seen during training. - The usefulness of the representations is evaluated by using them to initialize supervised action recognition models. This transfer learning approach outperforms training from scratch, especially when labeled data is limited.- Comparisons show the composite model works best overall. Conditioning the decoder on its own predictions is also generally helpful.- The approach is shown to work on both image patches and higher-level "percepts" from pretrained convnets.In summary, the key contribution is developing and analyzing LSTM-based approaches for unsupervised video representation learning, and showing these can improve performance on downstream tasks like action recognition. The techniques help capture structure and motion in videos for transfer learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes unsupervised learning models based on LSTM encoder-decoder architectures that learn video representations by reconstructing input frames and predicting future frames, and shows these learned representations can be used to improve action recognition when finetuned with limited labeled data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research on unsupervised video representation learning:- The use of LSTM networks as encoders and decoders builds on the sequence-to-sequence learning framework of Sutskever et al. However, this paper applies it in an unsupervised setting for videos rather than supervised translation.- It explores different variants like autoencoders, future predictors, and composite models. Using future prediction as an unsupervised task is similar to approaches by Ranzato et al. and Srivastava et al. However, this paper systematically compares different architectures.- The inputs explored include raw image patches as well as pre-trained convolutional network features. Using pretrained features builds on prior work extracting useful video representations from convolutional nets.- For evaluation, the paper nicely combines both qualitative visualization and analysis as well as quantitative experiments finetuning for action recognition. This provides a more comprehensive assessment compared to just looking at one.- The quantitative action recognition results are comparable but not state-of-the-art at the time. However, the focus is more on consistently showing improvements from unsupervised pretraining across settings.- Compared to contemporaneous work on large-scale supervised video classification, this paper takes a complementary unsupervised approach to learn generally useful representations.Overall, the paper makes solid contributions in a thorough exploration of LSTM autoencoder models for unsupervised video representation learning. It builds nicely on previous sequence learning and video analysis work. The analysis and comparisons between different models are quite valuable.
