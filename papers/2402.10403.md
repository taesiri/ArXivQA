## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on developing a method to analytically extract a mesh representation from neural implicit surface networks that utilize non-linear positional encodings like trilinear interpolation. 

Existing mesh extraction techniques rely on the piecewise linearity of continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) functions like ReLU networks. However, recent advancements in neural surface representation learning use non-linear encodings like trilinear interpolation to address issues like spectral bias. This poses challenges in applying CPWA-based mesh extraction. 

The paper specifically looks at trilinear interpolation methods for positional encoding. The key contributions are:

1) Provides novel theoretical insights showing that under the eikonal constraint commonly used to regularize signed distance functions, the hypersurfaces within a trilinear region transform into flat planes. 

2) Introduces a method to approximate the intersection points between three hypersurfaces, using two hypersurfaces and a diagonal plane. This enables broader applications.

3) Empirically validates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed analytical mesh extraction technique using metrics like chamfer distance and angular distance. Shows the correlation between eikonal loss and planarity of hypersurfaces.

The proposed technique can extract a parsimonious mesh representation from piecewise trilinear networks like those using HashGrid or TensorRF for positional encoding. It balances detail preservation and efficiency. The method also facilitates applications like normal map visualization, baking, and geometric loss.

Limitations include further scope to optimize the face extraction process. Curved surfaces are also challenging to represent and may need more strategic vertex allocations. Overall, this work provides a novel mesh extraction technique for trilinear neural networks and establishes a foundation for future research in decision boundary visualization and analysis.
