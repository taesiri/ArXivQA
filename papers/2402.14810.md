# [GeneOH Diffusion: Towards Generalizable Hand-Object Interaction   Denoising via Denoising Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14810)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenging problem of denoising hand-object interactions (HOI). Given an erroneous HOI sequence with incorrect hand trajectories, the goal is to refine the hand trajectory to remove artifacts like unnatural poses, spatial penetrations, and temporal inconsistencies. This is an ill-posed problem due to the complexity of interaction noise and the need to generalize to diverse interactions involving new objects, motions, and noise patterns.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes GeneOH Diffusion, a novel approach with two key components:

1. GeneOH: A contact-centric HOI representation that encodes hand trajectory, spatial relations, and temporal relations. It highlights noise, aligns diverse interactions, and canonicalizes using the interaction region's frame.

2. Diffusion-based Denoising: A domain-generalizable scheme involving a canonical denoiser trained to project whitened noisy samples onto the data manifold. The input is first diffused to the whitened space before cleaning with the denoiser.

Additionally, a progressive strategy with separate stages for denoising motion, spatial relations, and temporal relations is used to handle complex noise.

Main Contributions:

- GeneOH representation that parameterizes HOI effectively for denoising and generalizability 

- Domain-generalizable diffusion-based denoising scheme to handle diverse noise patterns

- Progressive multi-stage strategy to tackle complexity of interaction noise  

- State-of-the-art performance on multiple HOI datasets with real and synthetic noise

- Promising qualitative results for refining trajectory estimates and retargeted motions

The method achieves unprecedented generalization capability to novel objects, motions, and noise distributions through the innovative representation and denoising scheme. Both quantitative metrics and human studies demonstrate significant improvements over prior arts.
