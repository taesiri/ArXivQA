# [Unpacking Human-AI interactions: From interaction primitives to a design   space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for new ways to design interactions as we transition from human-computer to human-AI interactions. Current frameworks and guidelines provide high-level suggestions but lack specifics to guide the actual design and implementation of interactions.

- There is a gap between human and machine understanding of what an interaction entails. Need a way to specify interactions that bridges this gap.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop a system of interaction primitives and patterns that can encode the interactions between users and AI models as exchanges of understandable information.

- Interaction primitives capture intent (provide/request) and type (input/output/feedback) of communicated information. These are combined into crisply defined actions.

- Actions are further combined into sequential interaction patterns that reflect common structures like queries, requests, explanations etc.

- Patterns act as mid-level constructs, reusing lower level actions to capture intent while being understandable to humans.

Contributions:
- Review of dominant HAI paradigms and extraction of communicative acts

- Formalized vocabulary of primitives, types and actions to encode interactions as exchanges of meaningful information  

- Demonstrated application to specify interactions from a range of existing systems

- Compiled library of reusable actions and patterns for designing HAI interactions

- Discussed prototyping interactions and differences in patterns towards a design space that links concepts to technical realities

In summary, the paper develops a formalized system to crisply specify HAI interactions as sequences of understandable information exchanges. This bridges the gap between guidelines and implementation, providing constructs reusable across systems and scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework of interaction primitives and patterns to formally describe different types of information exchanges between humans and AI systems, with the goal of supporting the design and implementation of human-AI interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a semi-formal design space for Human-AI interactions, built on interaction primitives and patterns that specify the communication between users and AI systems. More specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A review of HAI interaction paradigms, design frameworks and guidelines, focusing on the different types of HAI communication.

2) A system of HAI primitives and types that encode the interactions between users and AI models as actions and message passing, capturing the intent and type of information exchanged.

3) A collection of interaction patterns as sequences of messages that capture common interactional structures and can serve as design patterns for human-AI interactions.

4) A demonstration of how this approach can be used towards a design space for HAI that creates possibilities for new interaction designs, keeps track of implementation issues, and bridges the gap between human and machine understanding of interactions.

In summary, the main contribution is formalizing a design space for Human-AI interactions built on primitives and patterns that aim to support the design and implementation of such interactions.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Human-AI interaction
- Design patterns
- Interaction primitives

- Semantic interaction
- Communicative protocols
- Information exchange
- Intent and type of communication
- Interaction requirements
- Design space
- Prototyping interactions
- Implementation concerns

The paper aims to develop a formalism and design space for specifying interactions between humans and AI systems using a set of interaction primitives and patterns. It reviews different paradigms like XAI, HITL, and hybrid intelligence, and explores how to characterize the communication between users and models based on intent and data type. The goal is to support the design and implementation of human-AI interactions by providing a repertoire of reusable interaction building blocks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a set of "interaction primitives" to specify the intent and type of information exchanged during human-AI interactions. How are these primitives defined formally? What are some examples of interaction primitives for common actions like providing input or requesting output?

2. The interaction primitives are combined into "interaction patterns" which capture common sequences of information exchange. What are some of the key interaction patterns identified in the paper through analysis of existing human-AI interaction systems? How do they relate to paradigms like Explainable AI and Human-in-the-Loop ML?

3. The paper claims interaction patterns can help explore new possibilities for human-AI interactions. How exactly can systematically exploring combinations and sequences of interaction primitives lead to new ideas or possibilities for interactions? Can you give some hypothetical examples not discussed in the paper?

4. What are some of the limitations of the proposed formalism for interaction primitives and patterns that the authors discuss? How can those limitations be addressed in future work to make the formalism more useful from an implementation perspective?  

5. The paper relates the proposed interaction primitives to ideas from agent communication languages. What specifically inspired the creation of interaction primitives? How does the proposed approach differ from typical agent communication protocols?

6. How does the proposed set of interaction primitives and patterns aim to bridge the gap between design guidelines/suggestions and actual implementation requirements for human-AI systems? What role do the modifiers play in capturing implementation details?

7. The paper demonstrates how the same interaction primitive/pattern can manifest differently in multiple human-AI interaction scenarios. What causes these differences in manifestation across use cases? How can modifiers help capture those differences?

8. The paper envisions the creation of a large library or design space consisting of reusable interaction building blocks. What are some ways such a library could be leveraged by designers and developers of human-AI systems? What kinds of functionality would be useful?

9. The overview relating patterns to requirements discusses how patterns map to choices around things like explanation methods and learning mechanisms. Does the set of relationships seem exhaustive? What other mappings between patterns and requirements might be useful to explore?

10. The paper envisions linking interaction requirements not just to patterns but also to model/data operations like model fitting, data preprocessing etc. What are some examples of such operations that might map to common interaction patterns like requesting explanations or providing evaluations?
