# [Evaluating Fairness Metrics Across Borders from Human Perceptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fairness in AI systems is an important issue, with examples like gender bias in algorithms. Group fairness aims to ensure fair outcomes between groups.
- Many fairness metrics have been proposed but it's impossible to satisfy all simultaneously. So which metrics align with human perceptions of fairness? 
- Prior survey studies were limited in scope to a few hundred participants from one country. Larger and more diverse studies are needed.

Methods:
- 4,000 participant survey across China, France, Japan and US (1,000 each)
- Survey covers demographics, explanation of 4 fairness metrics (quantitative parity, demographic parity, equal opportunity, equalized odds), and 3 decision scenarios (hiring, art project awards, employee awards)
- Participants rate agreement on applicability of metrics in each scenario, and choose most appropriate one

Results: 
- Country has biggest influence on choice of metric. France favors quantitative parity more. Japan/US choose equal opportunity more.
- Gender has small influence - males slightly favor demographic parity, females equalized odds
- Religion has little impact but ethnicity trends differ between countries
- In France, agreement levels on metrics did not vary much 

Limitations:
- Participant demographics may not perfectly match populations
- Compared Asia to Western countries, but trends differed between France and US

Contributions:
- Large international study on human perceptions of AI fairness metrics
- Key findings on influence of country, gender, religion, ethnicity on metric preferences
- Provides guidance for selecting appropriate fairness metrics in different contexts

The paper makes an important contribution in evaluating human perceptions of fairness metrics across diverse populations and scenarios to help guide the appropriate selection of metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper conducts a large-scale international survey with 4,000 participants from China, France, Japan, and the US to evaluate preferences and perceptions towards different fairness metrics across countries and demographic groups in various decision-making scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is conducting a large-scale international survey with 4,000 participants from China, France, Japan, and the United States to evaluate the appropriateness of various fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. The key findings are:

1) The choice of fairness metrics is most significantly influenced by the country of the participants. Participants from France demonstrate a preference for quantitative parity compared to other countries. 

2) Gender differences in metric selection are not significant, though some minor trends are observed. Males tend to favor demographic parity while females inclined towards equalized odds.

3) Religion does not have a large impact while ethnicity in different countries shows some varying trends in the choice of fairness metrics. 

In summary, this paper provides new insights into the relationships between personal attributes like country, gender, religion etc. and preferences for fairness metrics through a very large international survey.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Fairness metrics - The paper evaluates different definitions and measures of fairness, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, equalized odds, etc.

- Human perceptions - The goal is to understand which fairness metrics align with human notions and perceptions of fairness.

- International survey - The study collects questionnaire responses from 4000 participants across China, France, Japan and the United States. 

- Decision-making scenarios - Participants evaluate fairness metrics across three distinct scenarios related to hiring, art project awards, and employee awards.

- Personal attributes - The analysis explores how choice of fairness metrics relates to participants' country, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, education level, etc. 

- Statistical differences - A key aim is to leverage the large dataset to uncover statistically significant differences in fairness metric preferences based on personal attributes.

- Country influence - One major finding is that a participant's country has the most significant influence on which fairness metrics they view as most appropriate.

So in summary, the key terms cover fairness metrics, human perceptions, international survey, decision scenarios, personal attributes, statistical differences, and country influence on fairness views. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper conducts an international survey across 4 countries to evaluate perceptions of fairness metrics. What are some limitations or challenges with using online surveys for this type of cross-cultural research? How could the methodology be improved?

2. The paper defines a new fairness metric called "quantitative parity" that aims for equal positive predictions across groups. Why do you think this metric has not been extensively studied in prior fairness literature? What are some potential applications where it could be useful?  

3. The survey results show noticeable differences in fairness metric preferences between countries. What factors might explain why certain metrics resonate more in some national contexts versus others? 

4. The paper hypothesizes cultural influences from major religions can shape perceptions of fairness even among non-practitioners in a country. Do you agree with this view? Why or why not? What evidence supports or contradicts it?

5. Table 1 shows a summary of prior empirical studies on fairness metrics. How does the scale and scope of this paper's survey methodology compare? What new insights does this international approach enable versus single country studies?

6. The results reveal only minor differences in fairness metric preferences across demographic factors like gender, age and religion within each country. Why do you think national context has a bigger influence than these personal attributes?

7. The survey scenarios cover hiring, art contests and employee awards. Do you think the choice of scenario significantly impacts preferred fairness metrics? Why or why not?

8. The paper excludes some responses due to failures in comprehension checks on the metrics. Could this exclusion introduce any biases into the remaining analyzed results? Why or why not?

9. Do you think the reported country-level differences in this study would persist over time? Or could views on fairness shift, especially in younger generations? What evidence supports your perspective?  

10. The paper focuses on cross-national comparisons. What other cultural factors beyond nationality could influence preferences for algorithmic fairness metrics? How would you study such influences?
