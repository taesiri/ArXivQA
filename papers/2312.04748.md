# [Forcing Generative Models to Degenerate Ones: The Power of Data   Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Growing use of large language models (LLMs) trained by third parties raises concerns about their security vulnerabilities. Prior work has shown LLMs can be attacked via data poisoning, but implications for generative models on natural language generation (NLG) tasks are not well understood.

Solution:
- The paper performs a comprehensive exploration of various poisoning techniques and metrics to assess their effectiveness for attacking LLMs on NLG tasks like text summarization and completion. 

- It introduces metrics to quantify success and stealthiness of attacks tailored to NLG tasks, including Target Match to measure attacker-chosen phrases in model outputs.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates successful poisoning attacks on LLMs during fine-tuning using as little as 1% poisoned data for text summarization and 5% for text completion.

- Finds relative length and position of triggers critical for attack success and stealthiness. Full fine-tuning can be more or less vulnerable than prefix-tuning depending on the task.

- Shows text summarization is generally easier to attack than text completion. Metrics adapted for generative tasks better capture attack success than directly comparing model outputs to target outputs.

- Provides first systematic study of data poisoning attacks on LLMs for NLG, proposes suitable metrics, compares vulnerability of full vs prefix fine-tuning, and analyses factors affecting attack effectiveness.

The paper helps understand and defend against emerging data poisoning threats for generative LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

The paper demonstrates that it is possible to successfully poison large language models during fine-tuning using only 1% poisoned data through careful trigger design and evaluation metrics tailored to assess attack success on generative tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Evaluating a variety of triggers with varying lengths and target outputs across different aspects, such as relative length of the trigger, relative position of triggers in a sample, and analyzing their correlation with the overall effectiveness of the attacks.

2) Proposing evaluation metrics to gauge the performance of a poisoned generative model from two crucial perspectives: the success and the stealthiness of the attacks.

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the poisoning attacks through extensive experiments on two major NLG tasks: text summarization and text completion using two types of LLMs: encoder-decoder transformer T5-small and decoder-only causal LLM GPT-2. Showing that it is possible to successfully poison an LLM during the fine-tuning stage using as little as 1% of the total tuning data samples.

4) Presenting the first systematic approach to comprehend poisoning attacks targeting NLG tasks considering a wide range of triggers and attack settings. The findings are aimed at assisting the AI security community in devising appropriate defenses against such threats.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive analysis and characterization of data poisoning attacks on large language models for natural language generation tasks.

The paper explores data poisoning attacks against large language models fine-tuned on natural language generation tasks like text summarization and text completion. It looks at different techniques for crafting trigger sentences and inserting them into the training data, as well as appropriate metrics to evaluate the attacks' success and stealthiness. Key factors studied include the relative token length ratio of triggers and effectiveness of different tuning methods like full fine-tuning vs prefix tuning. The development of suitable metrics for generative models is also a focus, such as target match rates for attack success and clean accuracy for attack stealthiness. Overall, the paper provides a systematic analysis to understand vulnerabilities of LLMs to data poisoning attacks in the context of NLG applications.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using the token length ratio (R) between the trigger sentences and input sentences as a key factor influencing attack success. How exactly is this ratio calculated? What range of values for R were explored and what was the impact on attack success?

2. The paper evaluates 3 different strategies for inserting trigger sentences - fixed, floating, and pieces. Can you explain in more detail the difference between these 3 insertion strategies? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each? 

3. The paper introduces two new evaluation metrics - Target Match and Sneaky Perplexity. Explain in detail how each of these metrics is calculated and what specific aspects of attack success they aim to capture. 

4. For the text completion task, the paper shows prefix tuning is more vulnerable to attack than full fine-tuning. What differences between these two tuning methods may account for this finding?

5. The triggers used in the experiments are sentences about Mars. Did the paper experiment with other types of trigger sentences as well? If so, how did factors like topic, length, and position impact results?

6. The paper demonstrates successful attacks using as little as 1% poisoned data. Did the paper try even lower percentages? Is there a minimum level of poisoned data below which attacks become ineffective? 

7. The target outputs used medical terminology. Were other types of target output tested as well? How would you expect attack success rates to change with different target output choices?

8. The metrics introduced in this paper are tailored to natural language generation tasks. Could these metrics be further improved or generalized to other types of generative models? What modifications would be needed?

9. For real-world systems, what defenses could be introduced to protect against the types of data poisoning attacks demonstrated in this paper? What are some challenges associated with defending large language models?

10. The study was limited to two datasets per task and two model architectures. How could the analysis be extended to determine if the findings generalize more broadly across models, tasks, and data distributions?
