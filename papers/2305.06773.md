# [Towards a Better Understanding of the Computer Vision Research Community   in Africa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06773)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Computer vision is an important field with applications relevant to African communities, yet African researchers' contributions make up only 0.06% of top-tier publications in the last 10 years. 
- There is a lack of understanding of the current state of computer vision research conducted in Africa.
- There are questions around whether there is equity in access to research opportunities for African researchers.

Methods:
- The authors perform a bibliometric study on 63,000 Scopus publications related to computer vision from Africa over 2012-2022. 
- They analyze publication trends over time, collaboration patterns between African countries vs internationally, author contribution roles, and frequently used keywords.
- They also manually inspect subsets of the data to verify accuracy of African authorship and topic relevance.

Key Findings:  
- The vast majority (85%) of publications come from Northern and Southern Africa, with very little from Central Africa in particular. Recently Eastern and Western Africa's publications have grown.
- Only 0.06% of all top-tier venue publications are from Africa, with no consistent growth over time as seen in North America and Asia.  
- Most collaborations are international rather than across Africa. But most publications have key African author roles.
- Analysis of keywords shows alignment of some topics with region needs (e.g. remote sensing), but questions remain on whether research addresses the most urgent issues.

Main Contributions:
- First bibliometric study focused on documenting equity issues in African computer vision research 
- Novel method using author affiliation history to identify additional African authors in top conferences
- Quantitative analysis combined with community experiences to provide fuller picture of barriers facing researchers
- Laid groundwork to improve African computer vision research participation through future work on surveys, discussions, and bias studies

In summary, the paper provides a detailed data-driven view into the current limitations and strengths of computer vision research across Africa, while calling attention to the need for more equitable opportunities for African researchers and communities to actively participate and lead impactful work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents the first bibliometric study of African computer vision research, documenting inequities in publishing trends and opportunities across regions as well as gaps compared to other continents, as part of a grassroots effort to improve equity and access in the field across Africa.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) It presents the first bibliometric study on African computer vision research with the goal of better understanding the research landscape in Africa and documenting inequity in computer vision research. 

2) It documents discrepancies between publishing in top-tier and other computer vision venues, and demonstrates a novel way to use the affiliation history to identify some of the African researchers publishing in non-African institutions.

3) It analyzes the publishing temporal trends per African region, the collaboration patterns, and the most frequent keywords/topics distribution per region, followed by a discussion on equity in computer vision research.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of African computer vision research through bibliographic data to reveal strengths, weaknesses, and barriers facing researchers. It aims to question whether there is equity in access to research opportunities across different African regions. The analysis is done as part of a community effort focused on improving computer vision research capacity in Africa.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Computer vision
- Bibliometric study 
- Participatory approach
- Africa
- Equity in research
- Top-tier publications
- Geo-temporal analysis
- Collaboration patterns
- Keywords analysis
- Barriers in research
- Grassroots organizations

The paper presents a bibliometric study and analysis of computer vision research conducted in Africa over the past decade. It examines trends in publishing and collaboration patterns across different regions of Africa. A major focus is on assessing equity in access to publishing computer vision research, especially in top-tier venues. It also discusses potential barriers facing African computer vision researchers and highlights the role of grassroots organizations in improving the research ecosystem. The analysis employs a participatory approach to incorporate perspectives from the African research community. Overall, the key terms reflect the paper's emphases on bibliometrics, computer vision, equity, and community engagement within the African research context.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes both an automatic and a manual verification phase for the collected datasets. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of having a manual verification phase compared to solely relying on automatic verification?

2. In the manual verification phase, publications are verified based on topic relevance to computer vision and author affiliations. What other criteria could be considered in the manual verification process?

3. The paper uses the affiliation history of authors to identify additional African authors. What are some limitations of using affiliation history as a proxy for determining if an author is African?

4. Three datasets are collected in the paper - full, refined, and top-tier. Why is each of these datasets necessary and what specific insights do they provide? 

5. The co-occurrence matrix in Figure 6F shows connections between keywords that may not be intuitively clear. How could this matrix be further analyzed or visualized to derive additional insights?

6. Geo-temporal analysis is performed at the country and regional level. What additional geo-spatial analyses could provide further insights into equity of computer vision research across Africa?

7. International collaborations constitute a significant percentage of African computer vision research. What factors contribute to this and how could pan-African collaborations be further encouraged?

8. What data sources or publication databases beyond Scopus could be leveraged to provide additional insights into African computer vision research?

9. The discussion section provides qualitative insights from community members. How could the themes identified here be validated through a large-scale survey of African computer vision researchers?

10. Three initiatives are proposed based on the results - a survey of barriers, an academic committee for computer vision education, and studying biases in peer review. How would the outcomes of this bibliometric study specifically inform each of these initiatives?
