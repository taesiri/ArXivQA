# [Key-Point-Driven Data Synthesis with its Enhancement on Mathematical   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in complex reasoning tasks, but their performance is often limited by the scarcity of high-quality, reasoning-focused training data. 
- Prior efforts to augment math reasoning data have issues like limited diversity, reliance on constructed knowledge, and lack of reasoning steps.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Key-Point-Driven Data Synthesis (KPDDS), a new framework to synthesize question-answer pairs by extracting key points and exemplar pairs from authentic data. 
- KPDDS ensures generation of novel questions with rigorous quality control and scalability.

Key Contributions:
- KPDDS extracts topics and key points from seed data, computes topic co-occurrence patterns, and uses these to guide synthesis.
- The paper presents KPMath, the largest synthetic math reasoning dataset with over 1 million diverse and quality-controlled question-answer pairs.
- KPMath significantly boosts performance when used to fine-tune language models. Mistral-7B model fine-tuned on KPMath-Plus outperforms 7B models without coding and even some 34B models.
- A dual quality control mechanism with self-scoring and consensus voting is introduced and shown to improve reliability.

In summary, the paper proposes a new data synthesis paradigm that extracts knowledge structures to guide the scalable creation of novel, diverse and reliable synthetic reasoning data. The resulting KPMath dataset pushes state-of-the-art in math reasoning for 7B language models.
