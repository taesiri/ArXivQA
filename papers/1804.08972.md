# [FaceShop: Deep Sketch-based Face Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08972)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a novel system for sketch-based face image editing. The central goal is to enable users to intuitively edit face images by providing sketch and color strokes as input. The key research question is how to train a deep neural network to render high-quality and realistic image edits that correspond to the user's sketch and color input. 

The main hypothesis is that combining conditional image completion with image translation in a unified framework will lead to a system that can synthesize contextually coherent image edits with fine-grained user control. More specifically:

- Training the network on image completion with additional sketch and color constraints will enable control over the synthesized image region via the user strokes.

- Transforming photos to an ambiguous sketch domain during training will improve generalization to imperfect user sketches.

- Jointly training on image completion and translation tasks will enable the model to leverage both image context and user strokes to render realistic image edits.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that a conditional image completion framework trained with an appropriate ambiguous sketch domain will lead to a system that can generate high-quality, controllable image edits from sketch and color strokes provided by users. The paper presents experiments and results to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a novel system for sketch-based face image editing. The main contributions are:

- A new framework that enables intuitive local image editing by sketching strokes on top of an image. This allows users to edit images by providing geometry and color constraints.

- A sketch domain and training procedure for convolutional neural networks that generalizes well to real user sketches. This is achieved by introducing ambiguities between the sketch domain and real image structures during training.

- Formulating the problem as a combination of image completion and image translation. The system is trained end-to-end on these two tasks jointly. 

- A network architecture and training procedure that enables stable training on high-resolution images.

- An intuitive sketch-based interface that allows interactive editing in real-time.

- The ability to perform smart copy-paste editing by copying sketch representations from one image to another. This provides robustness to illumination and texture mismatches.

- High-quality editing results on a variety of operations like changing facial features, expressions, and colors. The system produces globally consistent edits without visible seams or other artifacts.

In summary, the key contribution is a new deep learning framework for interactive local image editing using sketching. This is enabled by technical contributions like the sketch domain, network architecture, and training procedure. The interface allows easy exploration of editing options and facilitates an efficient workflow.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for sketch-based face image editing using deep learning. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- Compared to unconditional image completion techniques like Iizuka et al. [1], this paper introduces sketch and color constraints to allow user control over the synthesis. The results are also higher resolution and have fewer artifacts. 

- Compared to image translation approaches like pix2pix [2], formulating the problem as conditional image completion is more robust. Direct translation struggles with ambiguities in converting the entire image to sketches, while this approach focuses only on completing the masked region.

- Compared to specialized techniques like eye inpainting [3], the proposed approach is more flexible by supporting editing of any facial regions. The smart copy-paste also subsumes approaches like eye opening.

- The sketch domain processing introduces ambiguities that improve generalization to real hand-drawn sketches compared to using raw edges. This allows the system to be more robust to imperfect user inputs.

- The proposed training procedure and architectures enable stable, high-quality training on higher resolution images than prior GAN-based approaches.

In summary, this paper combines concepts from image completion and translation in a novel way, leading to a flexible sketch-based editing system. The sketch domain and training process are designed to improve generalization. The results showcase significant improvements in quality, resolution, and flexibility compared to prior work.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Training the system on more diverse and higher resolution image datasets. The current model is trained only on face images at 512x512 resolution. Training on more varied image data at higher resolutions could improve the flexibility and quality of the system.

- Exploring additional user interaction tools and workflows. The current interface uses sketching for editing, but the authors suggest exploring other interaction modalities that could enable more intuitive workflows.

- Extending the system to video data. The current work focuses on image editing, but the authors propose exploring sketch-based editing techniques for video as well. Developing spatio-temporal models could enable video editing tools.

- Improving generalization capability to unseen content. The model currently struggles with generating completely new content like hairstyles. Exploring techniques to improve imagination and generalization could help address these limitations. 

- Combining with 3D modeling. The authors suggest combining the sketch-based interface with 3D modelling to enable editing from different viewpoints. This could improve editing flexibility.

- Optimization and efficiency improvements. To enable real-time editing, optimizations to improve run-time efficiency could be explored, such as network compression, pruning, and optimization strategies.

In summary, the main future directions are developing the system into a more flexible, higher-quality, and intuitive tool by expanding the data, interactions, output modalities, and efficiency of the underlying technology. Advancing these aspects could lead to more practical sketch-based editing capabilities.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a sketch-based framework for face image editing. At the core is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to perform conditional image completion. Given an input image with a masked region to be edited, sketch and color strokes from the user, and random noise, the CNN synthesizes the missing image content that is consistent with the user strokes and surrounding context. The CNN uses an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections. It is trained adversarially along with a discriminator network using a WGAN-GP loss function that encourages realistic image synthesis. The input sketch strokes are derived from an edge detection preprocessing step that adds ambiguity to improve generalization. The training procedure with random region masking and sketch/color transformation enables the CNN to perform context-aware image completion conditioned on user strokes. The interface allows iterative editing by interactively providing new strokes to guide the image synthesis.

This paper presents a novel system for intuitive sketch-based face image editing using generative adversarial networks (GANs). The system allows users to edit facial images by providing mask, sketch, and color stroke inputs to specify desired local changes. A conditional image completion network is trained on two tasks - image completion and image translation - to generate realistic edits that match the user inputs.
