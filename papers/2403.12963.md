# [FouriScale: A Frequency Perspective on Training-Free High-Resolution   Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Text-to-image diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL) are typically trained at a fixed image resolution. Directly using the pre-trained models to generate images at higher resolutions leads to issues like repetitive patterns and distortions. Prior approaches that stitch image patches or modify attention have limitations. The key challenge is to achieve structural and scale consistency across resolutions in convolution layers.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes FouriScale, a training-free approach to enable arbitrary-size high-resolution image generation from pre-trained diffusion models. FouriScale is based on frequency domain analysis and introduces two main modifications:

1) Dilated Convolution: By dilating convolution kernels with factors based on the resolution upscaling, structural consistency is achieved between low and high resolutions to preserve global structure. This is theoretically justified to be an ideal solution.

2) Low-Pass Filtering: This ensures scale consistency by removing high frequencies that can cause aliasing when downsampling features. Keeping low frequencies aligns feature distributions across resolutions.

Additionally, a padding-then-cropping strategy allows handling variable aspect ratios flexibly. FouriScale Guidance further improves image quality by using milder filtering for detail generation while retaining structural information.

Main Contributions:

- FouriScale enables pre-trained diffusion models to generate high-quality and high-resolution images of arbitrary sizes without any model retraining.

- It is simple, compatible across models, and does not need special pre-computations. Theoretical analysis provides insight into achieving structural and scale consistency.  

- Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness over prior training-free approaches across metrics and models. It also shows robustness across wide resolution upscaling factors.

- FouriScale sets a new benchmark and provides a frequency perspective to boost future research on ultra-high-resolution generative modeling.
