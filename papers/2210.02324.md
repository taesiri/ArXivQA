## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the fundamental question - is it promising or even possible to segment generic objects from real-world single images using existing unsupervised methods? To answer this, the paper systematically investigates the effectiveness of current unsupervised object segmentation models on challenging real-world images.

Proposed Solution and Main Contributions:

1. The paper first introduces 4 complexity factors (object color gradient, object shape concavity, inter-object color similarity and inter-object shape variation) to quantitatively measure the difficulty of objects and scenes in terms of appearance and geometry.

2. The paper implements 4 representative unsupervised segmentation models (AIR, MONet, IODINE, SlotAtt) and 1 supervised model (Mask R-CNN). Extensive experiments are conducted on 3 synthetic and 3 real-world datasets.

3. It is found that while existing models can achieve satisfactory results on synthetic datasets, they catastrophically fail on real-world images. By analyzing the distribution gaps of the 4 complexity factors between synthetic and real datasets, the failure is hypothesized to be caused by the differences in objectness biases.  

4. Through extensive ablative experiments on multiple groups of ablated real-world datasets, it is shown that the challenging distributions of both object- and scene-level biases in appearance and geometry are the key factors underlying the failure. The inductive biases in existing models do not match real-world objectness distribution.

5. The paper suggests two future directions: 1) exploit more discriminative objectness biases like motions; 2) leverage pretrained features from single-object images.

In summary, through quantitative analysis and systematic experiments, the paper shows that unsupervised segmentation of generic objects in real-world images is extremely challenging for existing methods. The work provides useful insights into future improvements.
