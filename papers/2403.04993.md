# [PromptIQA: Boosting the Performance and Generalization for No-Reference   Image Quality Assessment via Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) models struggle to adapt to new assessment requirements (preferences, criteria, etc.) for different application scenarios without being retrained or fine-tuned on large datasets made specifically for those requirements. However, making such datasets is time-consuming and labor-intensive. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a prompt-based NR-IQA framework (PromptIQA) that can effectively adapt to new assessment requirements using only a small number of image-score pairs (ISPs) as prompts, without needing fine-tuning after training.

The key idea is to use a sequence of ISPs, termed as image-score pair prompt (ISPP), to indicate the assessment requirement that the model should adapt to. The ISPP is encoded and fused with the image features before final quality regression. Two data augmentation strategies are used during training to enforce learning from the ISPPs: 1) random scaling - randomly rescale ISPP scores and GT labels by the same ratio, 2) random flipping - randomly flip ISPP and GT scores between MOS and DMOS types.

The PromptIQA is trained on a mixture of 12 IQA datasets to learn diverse requirements. During inference, new ISPPs can be provided to adapt the model to new requirements without retraining/fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a prompt-based NR-IQA method that can adapt to new assessment requirements using only a small number of ISP prompts, eliminating the need for fine-tuning.

- Introduces two data augmentation strategies to enforce learning assessment requirements from ISPPs during training.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple IQA datasets and shows excellent generalization ability to adapt to varied assessment requirements using ISPPs.

- Provides in-depth analysis and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of key components of the proposed method.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a prompt-based no-reference image quality assessment method that can effectively adapt to new assessment requirements using just a few image-score pairs as prompts, without needing to fine-tune the model after training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel NR-IQA framework called PromptIQA that can effectively adapt to new assessment requirements using just a small number of image-score pairs (ISPs) as prompts, without needing any fine-tuning after training. 

2. It introduces two data augmentation strategies (random scaling and random flipping) that make a strong correlation between the ground truth labels and the prompt, encouraging the model to effectively learn diverse assessment requirements from the prompts.

3. Experimental results demonstrate that the PromptIQA trained on a mix of 12 datasets using ISPPs shows outstanding performance and generalization. It can efficiently adapt to different assessment requirements through ISPPs, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In summary, the key innovation is the prompt-based framework that allows efficient adaptation to new IQA assessment requirements with minimal additional data, eliminating the need for fine-tuning or creating new specialized datasets. The data augmentation strategies and mixed dataset training further improve the model's ability to learn and generalize to varied requirements.
