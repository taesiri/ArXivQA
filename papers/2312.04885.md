# [VISAGE: Video Instance Segmentation with Appearance-Guided Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04885)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VISAGE, a novel online video instance segmentation method that enhances instance association by leveraging appearance information. The key insight is that existing query-based online VIS methods rely heavily on positional cues for tracking, leading to failures in complex scenarios. To address this, VISAGE introduces an additional "appearance query" that encapsulates visual characteristics of instances via mask pooling on backbone features. This appearance query, along with the standard object query, is trained using a contrastive loss to ensure more distinctive embeddings for robust matching. A simplified tracker is presented that computes similarity over both appearance and object embeddings, aided by a memory bank for temporal awareness. Extensive experiments on multiple VIS benchmarks demonstrate VISAGE's state-of-the-art performance. Notably, a synthetic dataset is introduced requiring appearance cues, where VISAGE significantly outperforms other methods. The simplicity yet effectiveness of enhancing tracking with appearance information is the main contribution. By recognizing and incorporating this overlooked cue, progress can be made on the challenging VIS task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VISAGE, a video instance segmentation method that enhances instance association by generating additional appearance queries to complement the object queries from a detector, and uses a simplified matching process guided by both object and appearance cues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel online video instance segmentation (VIS) method called VISAGE that enhances instance association by explicitly leveraging appearance information. Specifically:

- VISAGE introduces an additional "appearance query" that encapsulates the visual characteristics of an instance, in addition to the existing "object query". This appearance query is generated by performing mask pooling on the backbone feature maps.

- VISAGE employs contrastive loss to make the appearance and object embeddings more distinctive and improve association across frames. 

- VISAGE presents a simplified tracker that utilizes both object and appearance queries along with a memory bank to compensate for the lack of temporal awareness in online methods. This avoids complex post-processing heuristics used in previous trackers.

- Through experiments on VIS datasets like YouTube-VIS and OVIS, VISAGE demonstrates competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods. To better analyze the impact of leveraging appearance cues, the authors also generate a synthetic dataset where VISAGE significantly outperforms other methods.

In summary, the key innovation is enhancing online VIS by explicitly using appearance information to guide the association process, allowing more robust tracking than methods that primarily rely on positional cues.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current online video instance segmentation (VIS) methods rely heavily on query locations for tracking objects across video frames. This leads to failures in complex scenarios like shot changes or trajectory intersections where location information is ambiguous. 

- The paper analyzes this and finds that the object queries from detectors used in current VIS methods are imbalanced - they focus too much on positional cues and do not sufficiently embed object appearances.

- This is demonstrated by conducted experiments on flipped images, where despite distinct object appearances, existing methods still make association errors due to over-reliance on locations.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes VISAGE, a novel online VIS method that enhances instance association by explicitly leveraging object appearances in addition to locations. 

- It generates "appearance queries" that encapsulate visual characteristics of instances by performing mask pooling on backbone feature maps. Separate contrastive losses are used to make both appearance and object queries more distinctive.

- A simplified tracker is presented that matches current frame queries to memory bank queries using both appearance and object similarities, eliminating complex post-processing heuristics. 

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of appearance queries to alleviate imbalance between reliance on locations vs appearances in existing VIS methods

- A new VIS framework with appearance-guided enhancement that achieves strong performance across VIS benchmarks like YouTubeVIS and OVIS

- Analysis of effectiveness of appearance guidance using visualizations and performance comparisons on a novel pseudo dataset constructed to highlight need for appearance awareness

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive results on multiple datasets while using a simplified matcher and training process without complex heuristics
