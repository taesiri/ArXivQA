## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VISAGE, a novel online video instance segmentation method that enhances instance association by leveraging appearance information. The key insight is that existing query-based online VIS methods rely heavily on positional cues for tracking, leading to failures in complex scenarios. To address this, VISAGE introduces an additional "appearance query" that encapsulates visual characteristics of instances via mask pooling on backbone features. This appearance query, along with the standard object query, is trained using a contrastive loss to ensure more distinctive embeddings for robust matching. A simplified tracker is presented that computes similarity over both appearance and object embeddings, aided by a memory bank for temporal awareness. Extensive experiments on multiple VIS benchmarks demonstrate VISAGE's state-of-the-art performance. Notably, a synthetic dataset is introduced requiring appearance cues, where VISAGE significantly outperforms other methods. The simplicity yet effectiveness of enhancing tracking with appearance information is the main contribution. By recognizing and incorporating this overlooked cue, progress can be made on the challenging VIS task.
