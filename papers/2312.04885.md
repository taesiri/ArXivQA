# [VISAGE: Video Instance Segmentation with Appearance-Guided Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04885)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VISAGE, a novel online video instance segmentation method that enhances instance association by leveraging appearance information. The key insight is that existing query-based online VIS methods rely heavily on positional cues for tracking, leading to failures in complex scenarios. To address this, VISAGE introduces an additional "appearance query" that encapsulates visual characteristics of instances via mask pooling on backbone features. This appearance query, along with the standard object query, is trained using a contrastive loss to ensure more distinctive embeddings for robust matching. A simplified tracker is presented that computes similarity over both appearance and object embeddings, aided by a memory bank for temporal awareness. Extensive experiments on multiple VIS benchmarks demonstrate VISAGE's state-of-the-art performance. Notably, a synthetic dataset is introduced requiring appearance cues, where VISAGE significantly outperforms other methods. The simplicity yet effectiveness of enhancing tracking with appearance information is the main contribution. By recognizing and incorporating this overlooked cue, progress can be made on the challenging VIS task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VISAGE, a video instance segmentation method that enhances instance association by generating additional appearance queries to complement the object queries from a detector, and uses a simplified matching process guided by both object and appearance cues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel online video instance segmentation (VIS) method called VISAGE that enhances instance association by explicitly leveraging appearance information. Specifically:

- VISAGE introduces an additional "appearance query" that encapsulates the visual characteristics of an instance, in addition to the existing "object query". This appearance query is generated by performing mask pooling on the backbone feature maps.

- VISAGE employs contrastive loss to make the appearance and object embeddings more distinctive and improve association across frames. 

- VISAGE presents a simplified tracker that utilizes both object and appearance queries along with a memory bank to compensate for the lack of temporal awareness in online methods. This avoids complex post-processing heuristics used in previous trackers.

- Through experiments on VIS datasets like YouTube-VIS and OVIS, VISAGE demonstrates competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods. To better analyze the impact of leveraging appearance cues, the authors also generate a synthetic dataset where VISAGE significantly outperforms other methods.

In summary, the key innovation is enhancing online VIS by explicitly using appearance information to guide the association process, allowing more robust tracking than methods that primarily rely on positional cues.
