# [MERA: A Comprehensive LLM Evaluation in Russian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04531)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) for the Russian language. Existing benchmarks like Russian SuperGLUE and TAPE are becoming outdated as LLMs surpass human performance. 
- New benchmarking methodologies are needed that can reliably test advanced abilities of modern LLMs beyond classic NLP tasks, covering areas like reasoning, expert knowledge, ethics etc.

Proposed Solution - MERA Benchmark:

- Presents MERA (Multimodal Evaluation of Russian Architectures), a new benchmark with 21 textual tasks across 11 skill domains to evaluate generative models.

- Tasks are formatted as instruction datasets and categorized into problem-solving, exam-based and diagnostic datasets. Includes a mix of classification, multiple-choice, free-form answer and matching problems.

- Provides a robust evaluation methodology for LLMs with - fixed prompts to mitigate prompt tuning effects, few-shot evaluation strategy, and automatic metrics. 

- Offers a platform with scoring system, submission procedure and leaderboard for transparent LLM assessment.

Main Contributions:

- New standardized methodology and suite of 21 tasks for evaluating LLMs abilities in Russian across diverse skill dimensions.

- Covers abilities beyond classic NLP like reasoning, mathematical skills, expert knowledge, ethics etc. Serves as LLM benchmark oriented towards Russian language.

- Open-source codebase that promotes reproducibility by fixing evaluation parameters. Enables extension to other modalities.

- Public platform with submission system and leaderboard to track progress. Provides model baselines and comparison to human performance.

- Addresses risks of LLMs by including diagnostic datasets. Fosters development of safer and more reliable models.

In summary, MERA facilitates robust and reliable evaluation of modern LLMs for Russian language through its comprehensive benchmarking approach. Promotes transparency and mitigates risks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MERA, a new Russian language benchmark for evaluating large language models across 21 tasks in 11 skill domains, providing a standardized methodology, datasets, baseline models, and an open platform for fair and transparent benchmarking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing MERA (Multimodal Evaluation of Russian-language Architectures), a new benchmark for evaluating large language models and foundation models oriented towards the Russian language. Specifically, the paper:

- Presents a methodology for robustly evaluating LLMs in fixed scenarios to ensure reproducibility. This includes manually designing multiple prompts per task and fixing few-shot examples.

- Introduces 21 textual tasks covering 11 skill domains formatted as instruction datasets. The tasks aim to test different capabilities like language understanding, reasoning, world knowledge, etc. 

- Provides a platform with an automated scoring system and leaderboard for submitting and evaluating models on the benchmark tasks. 

- Establishes baseline results using open-source language models, multilingual models, and human evaluation. The analysis shows current models are still far from human-level performance on many of the tasks.

- Offers the benchmarks and platform as an open-source project to guide future research on developing and evaluating Russian language models. The goal is to standardize evaluation while also addressing potential risks.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of MERA, a comprehensive benchmark and platform for standardized evaluation of foundation models' capabilities on a diverse set of tasks in Russian.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed MERA benchmark aim to improve upon limitations of existing Russian language model evaluations like Russian SuperGLUE and TAPE? What new capabilities does it seek to measure?

2. What motivated the inclusion of exam-based tasks alongside problem-solving tasks? How do these different categories of tasks complement each other in evaluating language models?

3. The paper mentions mitigating the influence of prompt selection in evaluations. Can you elaborate on the methodology used for manually designing variative prompt sets? What steps were taken to reduce bias?  

4. Why was the instruction format chosen for framing the tasks? What are the advantages of this format compared to a standard input-output format?

5. The paper utilizes both likelihood-based assessment and greedy text generation. What are the tradeoffs in using these two strategies and how were tasks assigned to each one?

6. What considerations went into determining the appropriate number of few-shot examples to use for evaluation for each task? How were those numbers motivated?

7. Beyond accuracy metrics, what other metrics are used to quantify performance? Why were those metrics deemed suitable for certain tasks over other options?

8. How exactly is the overall benchmark score calculated from the multiple metrics? What steps are taken to normalize across disparate tasks and metrics?

9. What limitations remain in the proposed benchmark methodology and how might those be addressed in future work? 

10. The paper aims to standardize evaluation and address reproducibility issues seen in other benchmarks. What aspects of the methodology specifically tackle these problems? How does the submission procedure aid reproducibility?
