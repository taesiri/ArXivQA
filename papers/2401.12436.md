# [Wasserstein Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Wasserstein Differential Privacy":

Problem:
Existing differential privacy (DP) frameworks like pure DP, approximate DP, and Rényi DP tend to overestimate privacy budgets. This is because their privacy losses are based on divergences like KL divergence, which focus on the entire distribution rather than individuals. Also, their privacy losses do not satisfy properties like symmetry and triangle inequality to become metrics. This limits deriving tighter basic privacy properties and accurately computing cumulative privacy loss under composition.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Wasserstein Differential Privacy (WDP), which measures privacy loss using Wasserstein distance between outcomes of a randomized algorithm on neighboring datasets. Unlike divergences, Wasserstein distance focuses on transporting individual data points, hence captures privacy risk better. Also, WDP satisfies symmetry, non-negativity and triangle inequality, making it a metric. 

Key Contributions:

1. Introduction of WDP framework that forms a metric type of differential privacy using Wasserstein distance to capture privacy loss.

2. Proof that WDP satisfies excellent properties like symmetry, non-negativity, triangle inequality, monotonicity, post-processing, group privacy etc. making privacy analysis under WDP theoretically sound.

3. Derivation of advanced composition for adaptive algorithms, privacy loss of Gaussian mechanism, absolute moment for Gaussian distributions, and Wasserstein accountant tailored to track privacy budgets for stochastic gradient descent.  

4. Empirical analysis showing WDP produces lower and more stable privacy budgets across different scenarios like basic mechanisms, compositions, and CNN training, thus avoiding overestimation.

In summary, WDP forms a robust theoretical foundation for differential privacy using metric properties of Wasserstein distance. It allows tighter basic privacy guarantees and accounting under composition. Experiments validate improved privacy budget estimates under WDP compared to divergences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Wasserstein differential privacy, an alternative differential privacy framework based on Wasserstein distance that satisfies the properties of a metric, derives properties and accounting methods, and shows it can avoid overstating privacy budgets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new differential privacy framework called Wasserstein differential privacy (WDP) based on Wasserstein distance. WDP satisfies properties like symmetry, triangle inequality and non-negativity, allowing the privacy loss under WDP to become a metric. 

2. It proves that WDP has 13 excellent properties, including basic sequential composition, group privacy derived from triangle inequality. This shows the advantages of WDP as a metric differential privacy.  

3. It derives advanced composition, privacy loss formula, and absolute moment for WDP. It also develops Wasserstein accountant to track and account for privacy budgets in machine learning algorithms like SGD.

4. It evaluates WDP on basic mechanisms, compositions, and deep learning tasks. Results show WDP can avoid overestimating privacy budgets and lead to more stable privacy guarantees compared to other differential privacy frameworks.

In summary, the paper proposes Wasserstein differential privacy as an improved differential privacy framework with better mathematical properties. It develops the supporting theory and methods for implementing WDP, and shows its advantages empirically.

In summary, the key focus is on proposing and analyzing Wasserstein differential privacy as a metric-based definition of privacy with better properties compared to divergence-based definitions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the Wasserstein differential privacy method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims that Wasserstein differential privacy (WDP) satisfies the properties of a metric, including symmetry and triangle inequality. Why are these properties useful? What advantages does WDP gain by satisfying them?

2. How does the Wasserstein accountant derived for WDP compare to the moments accountant and Bayesian accountant? What are the key differences in how they track privacy loss? 

3. The paper shows connections between WDP and other differential privacy definitions like RDP and DP. What is the intuition behind these connections? How tight are the relationships between the different definitions?

4. In the basic mechanisms experiments, what explains the stability in privacy budgets for WDP across different orders? Why do the RDP privacy budgets show much more variance?

5. The paper hypothesizes that WDP can avoid overestimating privacy budgets. What evidence from the experiments supports this? Are there cases where WDP could potentially underestimate budgets?

6. How does the performance of WDP in the deep learning experiments compare to DP and BDP? Does the faster convergence suggest benefits beyond lower privacy budgets?  

7. The composition experiments claim WDP privacy budgets grow slower than DP/BDP. What properties of WDP lead to this slower growth? How does the growth rate change with more steps?

8. What optimization challenges need to be addressed to make the calculation of Wasserstein distances scalable and efficient for large databases?

9. Could the stability of privacy budgets under WDP potentially have disadvantages? For example, does it make WDP less adaptive in some cases?

10. The paper mentions WDP could release small budgets for very small databases. How could this limitation be addressed while retaining the benefits of WDP?
