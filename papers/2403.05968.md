# [IMU as an Input vs. a Measurement of the State in Inertial-Aided State   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In robotics, IMU measurements are often treated as inputs to a motion model and then preintegrated between pairs of estimation times. This avoids having to estimate the state at each IMU measurement time. 
- However, this approach has some drawbacks:
   1) It conflates IMU noise with process noise
   2) Unclear how to propagate state if IMU measurements dropout
   3) Doesn't easily incorporate multiple high-rate sensors

Proposed Solution: 
- Treat IMU as a measurement of acceleration and angular velocity which are part of the state vector
- Use a continuous-time trajectory representation based on Gaussian processes 
- Perform preintegration of heterogeneous factors (unary IMU factors + binary motion prior factors) between pairs of estimation times
- Achieve same computational complexity as classic preintegration (linear in number of measurements)

Contributions:
1) Detailed comparison of treating IMU as input vs measurement on a 1D simulation - show identical performance if hyperparameters properly tuned
2) Demonstrate preintegration of heterogeneous factors using Gaussian process interpolation  
3) Present novel lidar-inertial odometry using Singer motion prior 
   - Include acceleration in state
   - Treat gyro & accelerometer as measurements
   - Show improved performance over lidar-only odometry in simulation
4) Provide experimental validation on Newer College dataset
   - Unable to show lidar-inertial outperforms lidar+gyro
   - Discuss potential reasons and outline future work

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to incorporate IMU measurements in state estimation by treating them as measurements rather than inputs. Though experimental validation remains a challenge, simulation results are promising. The framework offers benefits in terms of modeling flexibility and computational efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper compares treating an IMU as an input to a motion model against treating it as a measurement of the state in a continuous-time estimation framework, shows they perform identically in simulation, and applies the measurement approach to lidar-inertial odometry with mixed results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A detailed comparison of treating an IMU as an input to a motion model vs. as a measurement of the state on a 1D simulation problem. The paper shows that these two approaches perform identically.

2. A demonstration of how to perform preintegration using heterogeneous factors (a combination of binary and unary factors) in continuous-time state estimation. 

3. A novel approach to lidar-inertial odometry using a Singer prior which includes body-centric acceleration in the state, along with results in simulation and on the Newer College Dataset.

So in summary, the main contributions relate to comparing IMU modeling approaches, showing a new preintegration technique, and presenting a method for lidar-inertial odometry. The key result is that treating IMU as a measurement rather than an input is a viable and promising approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it are:

- IMU (inertial measurement unit)
- Input vs measurement 
- Preintegration
- Continuous-time state estimation
- Gaussian processes
- Motion models
- Lidar-inertial odometry
- Singer prior
- Sliding window filtering
- Factor graphs
- Body-centric acceleration

The paper compares treating an IMU as an input to a motion model versus treating it as a direct measurement of acceleration and angular velocity. It introduces a method for "preintegrating" heterogeneous factors using continuous-time state estimation with Gaussian processes. The paper applies these concepts to lidar-inertial odometry using a Singer motion prior, and presents simulation and experimental results. Key terms like IMU, preintegration, Gaussian processes, factor graphs, and Singer prior are central to describing the techniques and contributions in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares treating an IMU as an input to a motion model versus as a measurement of the state. What are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of each approach that the paper discusses? How might the performance differ in practice?

2. The paper proposes a general approach to "preintegration" that can incorporate both binary factors (between pairs of states) and unary factors (for individual states). How does this approach retain the same linear time complexity as classic preintegration while being more general? 

3. The paper leverages a Singer motion prior that can model a range of motion from white-noise-on-acceleration to white-noise-on-jerk. What are the key parameters of this prior? How does the choice of prior affect factors such as smoothness and consistency?  

4. For the 1D simulation example, the paper shows the IMU-as-input and IMU-as-measurement approaches achieve identical performance when properly tuned. What implications does this finding have for treating IMUs as measurements in higher dimensional state spaces?

5. The lidar-inertial simulation shows improved performance over lidar-only, but the real-world experiments do not replicate this. What are some potential reasons for why the simulated performance gains did not translate to the real world?

6. The paper approximates the SE(3) trajectory using a sequence of local Gaussian processes. What are the limitations of this approximation in the context of preintegration and marginalization? How might a global Gaussian process formulation differ?

7. For the Newer College Dataset experiments, what might account for the lack of visible benefit when adding IMU acceleration measurements compared to just gyroscope measurements?

8. The paper proposes future work in creating a new dataset with vicon ground truth for high dynamic motions. What characteristics would this dataset need to properly evaluate high fidelity lidar-inertial odometry?

9. Could the proposed preintegration approach that supports heterogeneous factors be applied to other sensor combinations besides lidar-inertial, such as visual-inertial odometry? What considerations would come into play?

10. The paper discusses the potential to leverage control inputs like motor torques by incorporating them into the Gaussian process motion model. How might this benefit state estimation for drones or other actively controlled robots?
