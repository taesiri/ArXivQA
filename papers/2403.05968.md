# [IMU as an Input vs. a Measurement of the State in Inertial-Aided State   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In robotics, IMU measurements are often treated as inputs to a motion model and then preintegrated between pairs of estimation times. This avoids having to estimate the state at each IMU measurement time. 
- However, this approach has some drawbacks:
   1) It conflates IMU noise with process noise
   2) Unclear how to propagate state if IMU measurements dropout
   3) Doesn't easily incorporate multiple high-rate sensors

Proposed Solution: 
- Treat IMU as a measurement of acceleration and angular velocity which are part of the state vector
- Use a continuous-time trajectory representation based on Gaussian processes 
- Perform preintegration of heterogeneous factors (unary IMU factors + binary motion prior factors) between pairs of estimation times
- Achieve same computational complexity as classic preintegration (linear in number of measurements)

Contributions:
1) Detailed comparison of treating IMU as input vs measurement on a 1D simulation - show identical performance if hyperparameters properly tuned
2) Demonstrate preintegration of heterogeneous factors using Gaussian process interpolation  
3) Present novel lidar-inertial odometry using Singer motion prior 
   - Include acceleration in state
   - Treat gyro & accelerometer as measurements
   - Show improved performance over lidar-only odometry in simulation
4) Provide experimental validation on Newer College dataset
   - Unable to show lidar-inertial outperforms lidar+gyro
   - Discuss potential reasons and outline future work

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to incorporate IMU measurements in state estimation by treating them as measurements rather than inputs. Though experimental validation remains a challenge, simulation results are promising. The framework offers benefits in terms of modeling flexibility and computational efficiency.
