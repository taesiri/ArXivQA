# [Embodied Task Planning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01848)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper focuses on the task of embodied task planning for robots and agents using large language models (LLMs). The key research question is: How can we enable embodied agents to generate executable action plans for complex tasks in general indoor environments based on natural language instructions and visual perception of the surroundings? The central hypothesis is that by combining the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs with grounded visual scene information, the agent can produce more feasible and plausible action sequences to complete human instructions compared to using just the LLM alone.Specifically, the paper proposes:1) A method to construct a large-scale multimodal dataset of visual scenes, instructions, and action plans for training the task planner. This is done by prompting the GPT-3.5 LLM to generate grounded instructions and plans based on object lists representing the scenes.2) A framework called TaPA that finetunes a pretrained LLM (LLaMA) on this dataset to serve as the task planner. It takes as input the instruction and predicted objects from an open-vocabulary detector over multi-view images. 3) An evaluation benchmark measuring task planning success on complex instructions (more steps compared to prior datasets like ALFRED).The key hypothesis is that by grounding the LLM's knowledge with visual perceptions, the TaPA agent can produce more executable plans than using the LLM alone or other large multimodal models. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis and the advantages of the overall approach.In summary, the paper tackles the research problem of task planning for embodied agents by grounding LLMs with visual scene information, via a new dataset, model architecture, and benchmark. The central hypothesis is that this combination will yield more feasible plans.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors propose a task planning agent called TaPA for generating executable action plans grounded in physical scenes. This allows the agent to accomplish complex household tasks based on natural language instructions. 2. They construct a large-scale multimodal dataset containing triplets of visual scenes, instructions, and corresponding action plans. This is used to fine-tune pre-trained large language models as the task planner.3. They evaluate different large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) on embodied task planning using their proposed benchmark. Their method outperforms baselines by a significant margin.4. They study different strategies for representing the visual scene, such as collecting multi-view RGB images and using open-vocabulary object detection. This allows grounded action plans to be generated based on the objects that exist in the real environment.5. The embodied tasks considered are more complex and diverse compared to prior work, involving longer action sequences for tasks like making sandwiches. The proposed method can generate plausible plans for such complex instructions.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a framework and benchmark for embodied task planning that can leverage large pre-trained models and ground them in physical scenes via multi-view perception. This enables generating executable plans for complex household tasks based on natural language instructions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately without the full text of the paper, it's impossible for me to provide an accurate summary. However, based on the LaTeX code provided, it seems this paper introduces a method for embodied task planning with large language models. The key ideas appear to be:- Constructing a multimodal dataset of visual scenes, natural language instructions, and executable action plans. This dataset is generated using GPT-3.5 and careful prompt design.- Finetuning a large language model (LLaMA) on this dataset to create a task planning agent (TaPA) that can generate grounded, executable plans. - During inference, using open vocabulary object detection on multi-view RGB images to perceive the scene and generate a list of objects. - Feeding the instruction and object list to the finetuned TaPA agent to generate an executable plan grounded in the perceived environment.In summary, the paper proposes an approach to enable large language models to generate feasible plans for embodied agents by grounding the models in visual perception of the environment. But without the full paper text, it's difficult to provide more specifics. The core idea seems to be aligning language models with perception for embodied task planning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:- This paper focuses on embodied task planning, which aims to generate executable action plans for robots to complete complex instructions in real-world environments. This is an active area of research, with other recent works like SayCan and LLM-Planner also exploring grounded task planning. However, this paper argues that prior methods are limited to simpler tasks or constrained environments.- The key distinction of this work is the focus on more complex and diverse household tasks, such as making sandwiches or setting a table. The proposed TaPA method is designed to generate longer, multi-step plans that can handle more open-ended instructions. This represents an advance over methods that only work for basic manipulation tasks.- The paper introduces a new multimodal dataset of visual scenes, instructions, and action plans for training and evaluating TaPA. Compared to existing datasets like ALFRED, the collected data contains more complex tasks with longer action sequences, making for a more challenging benchmark.- While some prior works also combine language models with visual perception for planning, this paper employs an open-vocabulary object detector to build object lists representing the scene. This allows handling novel objects not seen during training. The ablation studies analyze different strategies for visual scene representation.- The proposed TaPA framework integrates large language model capabilities with grounded visual perception. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over previous state-of-the-art language and multimodal models like LLaMA and LLaVA on the complex planning benchmark.In summary, the key contributions are tackling more complex embodied tasks, introducing a new challenging dataset, and integrating language modeling with open-vocabulary perception to advance the state of the art in grounded task planning for robots. The proposed TaPA system and evaluation benchmark move forward the capabilities for real-world instruction following.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper does not seem to have explicit sections on future work or research directions. However, based on the content, here are some potential future research directions that could be suggested:- Developing more efficient architectures for the task planning agent (TaPA) to effectively embed scene information with fewer images/lower computational cost. The current approach of collecting multi-view RGB images and running object detection on all of them is computationally expensive. More efficient scene representation and active perception strategies could be explored.- Enlarging the multimodal dataset and enhancing the quality of the plans. The authors mention that sometimes the language model generates infeasible actions during dataset creation. Iterative prompt engineering and conversation could help the model correct itself and produce higher quality plans. - Designing a target-driven visual navigation framework to automatically find required objects in the generated plan, including novel/open-vocabulary objects. This could build on top of the current object detection pipeline.- Physically implementing the generated plans in more complex simulated environments. The current simple environments may not support all the diverse actions in the plans, so developing more capable simulators could be useful.- Exploring different modalities beyond just vision, like sound, touch, etc. to provide additional perception capabilities and scene understanding.- Validating the approach on physical robots in real-world environments, not just simulation. This would require addressing additional challenges like unknown/changing environments.- Extending the framework to accomplish collaborative or interactive tasks between two agents based on natural language communication.- Applying the grounded planning abilities to new application domains like robot-assisted surgery, home services, education, etc.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes an embodied task planning approach with large language models. The key steps are:1. Construct a multimodal dataset containing triplets of indoor scenes, instructions and action plans. The scenes are represented by object name lists. Carefully designed prompts and example action plans are provided to GPT-3.5 to generate a large number of grounded instructions and plans based on the object lists. 2. Finetune a pre-trained large language model (LLaMA) on the generated dataset to predict action plans given the instruction and object list. This serves as the task planning model.3. During inference, multi-view RGB images are collected at different locations in the environment. An open-vocabulary object detector is applied on the images to generate a list of objects in the scene. 4. The predicted object list and human instruction are fed to the finetuned LLaMA model to generate an executable action plan grounded in the physical scene.5. The approach is evaluated on a suite of indoor scenes and complex instructions. It outperforms baselines like GPT-3.5 and LLaVA in producing successful executable plans, showing the effectiveness of grounding language models with visual perception for embodied task planning.
