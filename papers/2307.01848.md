# [Embodied Task Planning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01848)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be: 

How can we develop an embodied task planning agent that can generate feasible action plans grounded in visual perceptions of the surrounding environment?

In particular, the paper proposes a framework called TaPA (Task Planning Agent) that aims to address the challenges of:

1) Generating complex and executable action plans based on natural language instructions and visual scene understanding. 

2) Grounding the generated plans in the physical environment by utilizing visual scene representations acquired through multi-view image collection and open-vocabulary object detection.

3) Outperforming state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and GPT-3.5 in producing successful action plans for embodied tasks.

The central hypothesis appears to be that by combining the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs with grounded visual scene representations, the proposed TaPA agent can produce action plans that are more feasible and implementable for embodied tasks in real indoor environments compared to existing methods. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by evaluating the proposed approach on a new benchmark dataset containing complex household tasks and comparing against other LLMs/LMMs.

In summary, the key research question is how to develop an agent that can effectively plan executable actions for embodied tasks by grounding language models to visual perceptions - which the paper aims to address through the proposed TaPA framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

- They propose the first benchmark for complex embodied task planning that is practical for realistic indoor deployment scenarios. 

- They design a framework to generate a large-scale multimodal dataset containing 80 indoor scenes with 15K instructions and corresponding action plans. This dataset is used to train the task planner based on pre-trained large language models (LLMs).

- They evaluate different LLMs and large multimodal models (LMMs) on embodied task planning using their benchmark. They also conduct ablation studies to determine the optimal representation of visual scenes for generating executable actions. 

- They propose a Task Planning Agent (TaPA) that can generate grounded action plans for complex household tasks without constraining the task types or target objects. TaPA combines human instructions with visual perception of the scene to produce executable plans.

- TaPA achieves higher success rates on generating feasible action plans compared to state-of-the-art LLMs and LMMs when evaluated on their embodied task planning benchmark.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel benchmark and framework (TaPA) for complex embodied task planning that grounds LLM-generated plans to physical scenes using visual perception. This enables executable planning for diverse practical indoor tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in embodied task planning:

- Compared to prior work that only addresses simple manipulation tasks like placing objects, this paper tackles more complex household activities like making sandwiches and setting tables. The tasks are more diverse and require longer action sequences, making the problem setting more practical but also more challenging.

- The paper constructs a new multimodal dataset for training the task planning agent, while much prior work relies on existing datasets like ALFRED. Generating customized data allows creating more complex and naturalistic instructions compared to using pre-defined simulators. The data generation process with GPT-3.5 and prompt design is an interesting contribution.

- Most prior methods only perform task planning in constrained environments like kitchens or single rooms. This paper aims to enable planning across indoor scenes like living rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Planning across diverse spaces requires more generalizable policies.

- Using open vocabulary object detection to perceive scenes makes the approach more generalizable to novel objects, compared to methods relying on fixed object vocabularies. The image collection strategies are also more thorough than just using single viewpoints.

- The paper shows superior performance over strong LLMs like GPT-3.5 and LLaMA, as well as multimodal models like LLaVA. This demonstrates the benefits of instructional tuning and grounding for complex embodied planning.

- The approach still relies on simulated environments for evaluation. Testing the framework on physical robots in real home environments would be an important next step towards deployment.

Overall, the key strengths seem to be enabling more complex and generalizable planning compared to prior work, through instruction tuning, diverse training data, open vocabulary perception, and evaluation across multiple scene types. Testing the limits of the approach on real robots could further demonstrate its reliability and practical benefits.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper does not seem to contain explicit suggestions for future work. However, based on the content and approach presented, some potential future research directions could include:

- Expanding the multimodal dataset with more complex instructions and longer action sequences to train the task planner on an even broader range of real-world tasks.

- Exploring different prompts and prompt engineering techniques to further improve the quality and plausibility of the action plans generated by the language model. 

- Designing more sophisticated scene representation methods beyond just object lists, such as relation graphs or 3D scene graphs, to provide richer contextual information.

- Developing an active perception and navigation framework to more efficiently collect visual information needed to represent the scene and discover required objects.

- Moving beyond simulation to test the framework on real robotic platforms and in real-world environments. This could uncover new challenges with grounding the generated plans.

- Enabling the agent to ask clarifying questions or otherwise interact with users to resolve ambiguities or gather additional information needed for planning.

- Scaling up the framework with larger language and vision models as they become available to take advantage of their increased capacity.

In summary, expanding the dataset diversity, improving the language grounding, active perception, real-world testing, human interaction, and model scaling seem like promising directions for future work based on this paper. The authors have presented an intriguing first step towards practical embodied task planning with large language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main method used involves the following key steps:

- The authors construct a multimodal dataset containing triplets of indoor scenes, instructions, and corresponding action plans. They represent the visual scenes by a list of existing objects and design text prompts for the GPT-3.5 model to generate 15K instructions and action plans grounded to the scenes. 

- This generated dataset is used to fine-tune the pre-trained LLaMA model as a task planner. During inference, the task planner takes as input the human instruction and a list of objects predicted from multi-view RGB images of the physical scene collected by an embodied agent. 

- To acquire the object list, the agent visits different achievable standing points to collect RGB images capturing the scene from various views. These images are fed into an open-vocabulary object detector to generate the list of objects existing in the scene. 

- The finetuned LLaMA model takes the human instruction and predicted object list as inputs and generates an executable action plan grounded to the objects present in the physical scene.

- Experiments show this approach allows the agent to produce action plans with higher success rates compared to state-of-the-art LLMs and LMMs when evaluated on complex household tasks. The method enables generating grounded plans without constraints on task types or target objects.

In summary, the key innovation is using prompt engineering and multimodal data generation with GPT-3.5 to create a large dataset for training an LLM-based task planner that can produce executable plans by grounding them to the surrounding physical environment perceived through embodied vision.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper does not seem to provide enough context to summarize its main idea or contributions. However, based on the LaTeX code and package imports, I can make some guesses about the general topic:

- It appears to be a conference paper submission, perhaps for an AI/robotics conference like CoRL (Conference on Robot Learning).

- It is using AI2-THOR, which is a simulator for indoor scenes and robotics research. So this is likely about embodied AI and robotics in indoor environments.

- It imports some computer vision and deep learning packages like PyTorch and Detectron2. So it probably involves training visual perception models like object detectors. 

- It defines prompts and formats related to instructions, actions, plans, etc. So a main focus seems to be generating executable plans or instructions for embodied agents.

Without more context from an abstract, introduction, or methodology section, it is difficult to pinpoint the specific problem being addressed. But in general, this seems to be a paper about enabling embodied AI agents to follow complex instructions and generate feasible action plans in realistic indoor environments like homes, using visual perception and natural language interaction. The key ideas are likely around grounding language models with visual inputs, generating suitable training data, and designing systems that can take high-level instructions and output executable low-level action sequences. More specifically, the contributions are not possible to discern from just the preamble.
