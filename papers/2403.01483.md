# [BronchoCopilot: Towards Autonomous Robotic Bronchoscopy via Multimodal   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01483)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure to inspect lung airways and diagnose diseases. It requires physicians to carefully maneuver flexible instruments through complex and narrow airway structures to reach distal lung lesions. This demands extensive training and skills. Existing methods for autonomous robotic bronchoscopy rely on either vision or proprioception alone, limiting performance in challenging scenarios. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes BronchoCopilot, a multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) agent for autonomous robotic bronchoscopy. BronchoCopilot leverages both visual data from the bronchoscope camera and estimated robot pose information to determine optimal manipulation actions. A 3-stage training approach is used:

1) Stage I: Extract compact representations for visual and proprioceptive data separately using reconstruction tasks.

2) Stage II: Fuse the representations using a cross-modal attention mechanism into a joint state representation.

3) Stage III: Learn manipulation policy using proximal policy optimization RL algorithm based on state representation.   

Main Contributions:

- First work to apply multimodal RL for autonomous control of interventional surgical robots

- Novel 3-stage training framework with cross-attention based multimodal fusion to handle heterogeneity and improve convergence 

- Detailed experiments in realistic simulator showing BronchoCopilot reaches ~90% success for complex 5th generation airway access with smooth motions

- Rapid adaptability - end-to-end fine-tuning to new patient cases takes only ~45 mins on average

- Performance improved greatly over vision or proprioception only methods, highlighting benefits of multimodality

The method represents a key advancement in autonomous bronchoscopy, especially for challenging distal lung access. Next steps are validation on physical robots and clinical translation.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:
