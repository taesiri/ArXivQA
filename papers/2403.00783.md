# [On the Roles of LLMs in Planning: Embedding LLMs into Planning Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00783)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent works have shown that large language models (LLMs) have some emergent planning capabilities, but they are still quite limited when tried to solve planning problems completely autonomously. 
- However, using the (often incorrect) plans generated by LLMs as "seed" plans for traditional planners can improve the planners' efficiency. 
- This suggests LLMs may have useful knowledge to assist in the planning process, but it's not clear how to best utilize LLMs to aid existing planning techniques.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new approach called "LLMs4Plan" which deeply integrates LLMs into the graph-based planning framework in two key ways:
   1) Using LLMs to prune the action selection when expanding each level of the planning graph 
   2) Using LLMs to sort the candidate action sets during backtracking search to prioritize more promising sets
- This allows leveraging the strengths of both the graph planning framework and the reasoning/common sense knowledge of LLMs.

Contributions:
- Proposes a novel planning framework that deeply embeds LLMs within the graph planning algorithm to enhance efficiency and supplement reasoning.
- Empirically demonstrates that the approach improves planning performance over both standard graph planning and having the LLM try to solve problems independently.
- Provides new insights into effectively utilizing LLMs to assist existing planning techniques, rather than just treating them as black-box solvers.
- Shows the potential of combining reasoning capabilities of neural models with structured planning frameworks.

Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary. I aimed to capture the core essence of the problem, proposed approach and contributions in a detailed yet accessible way.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel planning framework, LLMs4Plan, which deeply embeds large language models into graph-based planning by using LLMs to help select promising actions when expanding planning graphs and build non-mutual action sets when backtracking from goal states, demonstrating improved efficiency and effectiveness over traditional graph planning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel planning framework called LLMs4Plan that deeply embeds large language models (LLMs) into two critical levels of a graph-based planning framework:

1) Selecting promising actions when expanding each action layer of the planning graph. This helps prune less useful actions and reduces search space.

2) Building non-mutual action sets when backtracking from the last state layer containing goals. This helps select only the most promising action sets to backtrack instead of enumerating all valid action sets, further reducing search space.

By embedding LLMs in these two key steps of graph planning, the paper shows improved planning effectiveness and efficiency compared to using LLMs or graph planning alone. The main insight is on identifying complementary strengths of LLMs and planning frameworks and combining them for better performance. This provides a new direction for tightly integrating LLMs into existing planning techniques instead of just using them as black boxes.

In summary, the core contribution is the LLMs4Plan framework that deeply embeds LLMs into graph planning and demonstrates their usefulness in playing particular roles to enhance planning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Planning graphs
- Graph-based planning
- Embedding LLMs into planning frameworks
- Selecting promising actions
- Building non-mutual action sets
- Mutual constraints 
- Prompt generation
- Effectiveness of combining LLMs and planning techniques

The main ideas explored are using LLMs to assist with certain steps of graph-based planning by generating prompts to help select promising actions to expand the graphs and build non-mutual action sets. This aims to demonstrate that simply using LLMs on their own for planning is ineffective, but embedding them in planning frameworks can utilize their strengths while overcoming limitations. The key goal is studying the roles LLMs can play to improve planning techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes embedding LLMs into two levels of the planning graph - mutual constraints generation and constraints solving. What are some other levels in the planning graph framework where LLMs could potentially be embedded to further improve performance?

2. The prompts designed for the LLMs seem to simply convert the planning graph information into text format. Could more structured prompts specifically designed to leverage the strengths of LLMs lead to better performance? 

3. The paper compares against finetuning LLMs with training data. How do you think the sample efficiency of this method compares to finetuning, especially as problem complexity increases?

4. Could the ideas proposed in this paper be extended to probabilistic planning frameworks? What changes would need to be made?

5. The authors identify runtime as an issue due to multiple LLM calls. What optimization strategies could help mitigate this limitation?

6. How suitable is this approach for replanning in dynamic environments where the problem changes over time? Would the LLMs need to be queried from scratch each time?

7. The authors mention more complex planning languages like PDDL. How challenging would it be to extend this approach to handle expressive planning constructs like numeric fluents, durative actions, etc? 

8. How robust is this approach to errors in the domain model provided to the planner? Could the LLMs potentially help detect or correct flaws in inaccurate domain models?

9. What mechanisms could make this approach more sample efficient compared to methods that finetune LLMs with planning demonstration data?

10. The paper studies classical planning. Do you think similar ideas could apply to decision-theoretic planning frameworks like MDPs and POMDPs by leveraging the predictive capacities of LLMs?
