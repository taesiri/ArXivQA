# [On the Roles of LLMs in Planning: Embedding LLMs into Planning Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00783)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent works have shown that large language models (LLMs) have some emergent planning capabilities, but they are still quite limited when tried to solve planning problems completely autonomously. 
- However, using the (often incorrect) plans generated by LLMs as "seed" plans for traditional planners can improve the planners' efficiency. 
- This suggests LLMs may have useful knowledge to assist in the planning process, but it's not clear how to best utilize LLMs to aid existing planning techniques.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new approach called "LLMs4Plan" which deeply integrates LLMs into the graph-based planning framework in two key ways:
   1) Using LLMs to prune the action selection when expanding each level of the planning graph 
   2) Using LLMs to sort the candidate action sets during backtracking search to prioritize more promising sets
- This allows leveraging the strengths of both the graph planning framework and the reasoning/common sense knowledge of LLMs.

Contributions:
- Proposes a novel planning framework that deeply embeds LLMs within the graph planning algorithm to enhance efficiency and supplement reasoning.
- Empirically demonstrates that the approach improves planning performance over both standard graph planning and having the LLM try to solve problems independently.
- Provides new insights into effectively utilizing LLMs to assist existing planning techniques, rather than just treating them as black-box solvers.
- Shows the potential of combining reasoning capabilities of neural models with structured planning frameworks.

Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary. I aimed to capture the core essence of the problem, proposed approach and contributions in a detailed yet accessible way.
