# [A Rational Analysis of the Speech-to-Song Illusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06992)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The speech-to-song illusion is a phenomenon where repeating a spoken phrase makes it sound increasingly musical, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In particular, it is unclear (i) why repetition causes the effect on average, (ii) why the strength increases with more repetitions, (iii) why some phrases transform readily while others resist transformation. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose analyzing the problem from a statistical inference perspective - specifically, determining whether a repeated stimulus is more probable under a generative model of speech or song lyrics. 
- They model this using Bayesian inference to compute the log-odds ratio between the probabilities under song vs speech models. Higher positive values indicate the stimulus is more song-like.
- They apply this model to textual corpora, using word repetition statistics in speech and song transcripts as a proxy for melodic repetition.  

Main Contributions:
- Provides a computational framework based on rational analysis to model the speech-to-song illusion and explain its key properties based on statistical regularities in speech and song.
- Analysis of textual corpora is sufficient to reproduce transformation effects and differential phrase sensitivity found empirically.
- The framework further predicts and confirms existence of a "prose-to-lyrics" textual illusion that does not require acoustic stimuli.
- Overall, helps explain the illusion as optimal Bayesian inference given learned statistical expectations of repetition in speech vs song.

In summary, the paper offers a principled computational account of the speech-to-song illusion grounded in statistical patterns underlying language and music. The theory-driven approach also led to the discovery of a new purely textual version of the illusion.
