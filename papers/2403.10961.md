# [Energy-Based Models with Applications to Speech and Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of energy-based models (EBMs), which are an important class of probabilistic models for various applications in speech and language processing. 

Problem:
EBMs are radically different from other popular self-normalized probabilistic models as they are un-normalized and involve a partition function. This uncontrolled normalization admits greater modeling flexibility but also introduces difficulties in likelihood evaluation, parameter learning, and sampling. These challenges have limited the practical application of EBMs.

Solution:
This paper reviews algorithmic progress and applications of EBMs for speech and language processing. It covers basics of EBMs including classic examples like Ising models and restricted Boltzmann machines as well as modern parameterizations using neural networks. Various learning algorithms are described ranging from maximum likelihood with Monte Carlo methods to noise contrastive estimation. Sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo and self-normalized importance sampling are also introduced.

The paper then shows how EBMs can be developed for marginal, conditional and joint distributions with applications in:
- Language modeling 
- Speech recognition
- Sequence labeling in NLP
- Text generation
- Semi-supervised learning
- Calibrated natural language understanding

Challenges particular to speech and language data like trans-dimensional modeling and label bias are addressed. Models tailored for discrete sequential data like the trans-dimensional random field LM are covered. The paper shows how conditional random fields can be upgraded to joint random fields for semi-supervised sequence labeling.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive review of EBMs for speech and language processing
- Covers EBM basics, algorithms, architectures and a wide range of applications
- Explains trans-dimensional modeling for sequences of varying lengths
- Describes upgrades from conditional models like CRFs to joint models like JRFs
- Discusses label bias, exposure bias and overcoming them with global normalization

The paper will serve as a highly useful resource for understanding capabilities of EBMs and guide development of new models and applications, especially for speech and language tasks involving sequential data.
