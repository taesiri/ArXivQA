# Personalized Dialogue Generation with Diversified Traits

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to incorporate explicit personality traits into conversational agents to generate more human-like, personalized dialogues. Specifically, the paper proposes a new task of generating personalized dialogues by conditioning response generation on explicit personality traits represented as key-value pairs (e.g. age, gender, location). The key research questions include:- How can personality traits be modeled and incorporated in neural conversational models to generate personalized responses? - How can different traits be captured and addressed dynamically based on contexts during the dialogue?- How to construct a large-scale dialogue dataset with speaker personality traits to facilitate research on this task?To address these questions, the paper makes the following main contributions:1) Constructs a new large-scale Chinese dialogue dataset "PersonalDialog" containing over 20M sessions with speaker personality traits.2) Proposes persona-aware models to incorporate explicit traits using a trait fusion module and persona-aware decoding approaches. 3) Evaluates the models' ability to generate responses expressing appropriate traits through automatic metrics and human evaluation.In summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling explicit personality traits can improve the personalization and human-likeness of dialogue agents. The paper explores methods to incorporate such traits in neural models and provides a new dataset to facilitate further research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new task of generating personalized dialogues by incorporating explicit personality traits, in order to build more human-like conversational systems. 2. It constructs a large-scale dialogue dataset called PersonalDialog, containing over 20 million sessions with diversified personality traits for each speaker. This facilitates research not just on personalized dialogues but also on computational sociolinguistics.3. It develops persona-aware dialogue generation models within the sequence-to-sequence learning framework, using a trait fusion module and techniques like persona-aware attention and persona-aware bias. Experiments show the models can capture personality traits and choose proper traits based on context.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the novel task, constructing a large personalized dialogue dataset to facilitate related research, and developing persona-aware models that show promising results on incorporating personality traits for personalized dialogue generation. The paper lays the groundwork in this new research direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a large-scale dialogue dataset called PersonalDialog that contains rich personality traits for each speaker, and proposes persona-aware models to generate personalized responses by explicitly capturing diversified traits like gender, age, and location using a trait fusion module and persona-aware decoding techniques.
