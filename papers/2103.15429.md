# [Efficient Explanations from Empirical Explainers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15429)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be whether efficient "Empirical Explainers" can be trained to approximate the attribution maps of more computationally expensive explainers, as a way to mitigate the computational burden and ecological impact of generating neural explanations. 

Specifically, the authors propose using feature attribution modelling to train Empirical Explainers that learn from data to predict the attribution maps that would be generated by expensive explainers like Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values. They then evaluate whether these Empirical Explainers can generate explanations with significant accuracy compared to the expensive methods, but at a much lower computational cost.

The central hypothesis appears to be that Empirical Explainers can model expensive explainers with enough fidelity to be useful in applications where some approximation error is tolerable, thereby providing a more efficient way to generate explanations for neural models. The authors test this hypothesis by training and evaluating Empirical Explainers on language tasks.

In summary, the main research question is whether efficient Empirical Explainers can be trained to approximate expensive explainers well enough to mitigate the computational costs and ecological impacts of generating neural explanations in certain applications. The hypothesis is that this is feasible, which the authors evaluate empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing the task of feature attribution modelling to efficiently approximate expensive attribution methods like Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values.

2. Introducing Empirical Explainers - models trained to predict the attribution maps of expensive explainers, which require only a single pass through the Empirical Explainer at test time rather than multiple passes through the original model. 

3. Evaluating Empirical Explainers on four language tasks with Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values as the target explainers. The results show the Empirical Explainers can approximate the attributions of the expensive methods fairly accurately, while being much more efficient.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be introducing the idea of training efficient Empirical Explainers to model the behavior of expensive attribution methods, providing a way to get approximate explanations much more efficiently. The proposed Empirical Explainers demonstrate this is feasible in the language domain, providing a path to greener and more efficient explanations in cases where approximation errors are tolerable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes training Empirical Explainers, smaller neural models that efficiently approximate the attribution maps of computationally expensive explanation methods for neural networks, as a way to reduce the ecological impact of generating explanations in production environments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in explainable AI:

- The focus on energy efficiency and environmental impact is novel. Most work in explainable AI focuses on faithfulness, human interpretability, etc. Looking at the ecological impact and "green AI" is an important new perspective.

- The idea of training "Empirical Explainers" to approximate expensive explanation methods is creative. Much research on efficient explanations focuses on modifying the explanation algorithms themselves. Training a separate model is a clever approach.

- The evaluation rigorously compares efficiency and accuracy. Many papers introduce new explanation methods but don't systematically evaluate the tradeoffs. The comparison of model passes, runtimes, training costs, convergence curves, etc. is thorough.

- The scope on feature attribution methods for NLP models is reasonably narrow. Many papers try to cover multiple explanation types across different domains. Focusing on one domain allows more depth.

- The open-source release of code and models enables reproducibility. Many papers lack code/data release, which hinders reproducibility. The open release is a strength.

Overall, I'd say the novel focus on efficiency/environmental impact, creative Empirical Explainer idea, rigorous evaluation, reasonable scope, and open release help this paper advance the state of explainable AI research in a valuable way. The approach seems promising and the thorough analysis provides a solid contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Testing Empirical Explainers on out-of-domain data to investigate their robustness and generalizability. The authors note that they only trained and tested the Empirical Explainers on in-domain data. Evaluating them on out-of-domain data could provide more insight into their behavior.

- Considering additional input features for the Empirical Explainers beyond just the input tokens, such as the gradients with respect to the inputs. This may require an extra pass through the model but could potentially improve the accuracy of the Empirical Explainers.

- Exploring the use of more sample efficient attribution methods as targets for training the Empirical Explainers. The authors suggest that some explanation methods require fewer samples than the Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values tested in the paper. Using more efficient target explainers could potentially improve the efficiency even further.

- Incorporating the efficiency term from the cost function (Equation 1) directly into a differential training framework, rather than just addressing it via model design. This could allow automatic optimization of the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff.

- Testing the framework on additional domains beyond language, such as computer vision, time series, etc. The current experiments focus on NLP but the approach could likely be applied more broadly.

- Investigating other model architectures and training procedures for the Empirical Explainers. The authors made some design choices in their experiments but the framework allows room for alternate approaches.

So in summary, the key directions mentioned are evaluating out-of-domain generalization, incorporating additional input features, using more efficient target explainers, directly optimizing for efficiency, expanding to new domains, and exploring alternative model architectures/training. The framework proposed allows for significant further research to build on the initial experiments presented.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Empirical Explainers - a method to efficiently approximate computationally expensive attribution methods for neural network explainability. It motivates the approach by highlighting how many popular attribution methods like Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values require multiple passes through the model, quickly exceeding the computation cost for model training and inference. To address this, Empirical Explainers train a separate model to predict the attributions from the expensive methods, requiring only a single pass through the Empirical Explainer at test time. The authors formally define Empirical Explainers, discuss their properties, and present experiments on language tasks with BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa and ELECTRA models. The results show the Empirical Explainers can approximate the expensive methods surprisingly well, with varying degrees of error. The authors argue Empirical Explainers could be a viable energy-efficient alternative to expensive explainers in applications where some approximation error is acceptable. They also discuss limitations, related work, and future directions. Overall, the paper makes a novel contribution in modeling feature attributions for efficient neural network explanations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using Empirical Explainers to efficiently approximate computationally expensive feature attribution methods for explaining neural network predictions. Empirical Explainers are neural networks trained to predict the attribution maps output by expensive explainers. This allows empirical explanations to be generated with just a single forward pass through the Empirical Explainer network, rather than multiple passes through the original neural network required by methods like Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values. 

The authors evaluate Empirical Explainers on language tasks using BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA classifiers. They find the empirical explanations achieve significant accuracy in modeling the expensive explanations, while requiring only a fraction of the computation. Quantitative results show the Empirical Explainers match the accuracy of the expensive methods with many fewer samples. Qualitative examples also show the empirical heatmaps closely match the patterns in the target explanations. This indicates Empirical Explainers could be a more efficient alternative for applications where some approximation error is acceptable. Their approach highlights a way to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the computational burden of neural network explanations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes training Empirical Explainers to efficiently approximate the attribution maps of computationally expensive explainers like Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values. Empirical Explainers are neural networks that take the same inputs as a classifier (e.g. tokens for an NLP model) and are trained to predict the attribution scores that would be assigned to each input by the expensive explainer. This allows the Empirical Explainer to generate an approximate attribution map with a single forward pass, compared to the multiple passes through the classifier required by methods like Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values. The Empirical Explainers are trained by generating attribution maps using the expensive explainer on the training data, and then fitting the Empirical Explainer parameters to predict these target attribution maps. Experiments in the paper show Empirical Explainers can model expensive explainers well while being much more efficient, at the cost of some approximation error.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is how to make neural network explanations more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. Specifically, it focuses on the computational expense of prominent explanation methods like Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values, which require multiple passes through a model to generate explanations. 

The key questions the paper seems to be exploring are:

1) Can we develop more efficient ways to generate explanations that require fewer computations and less energy, while still providing useful explanations?

2) Can we train "Empirical Explainers" that learn to predict the explanations of costly methods using only a single pass through a model?

3) How accurately can these Empirical Explainers approximate the attributions of expensive explainers, and does this provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and explanation quality?

So in summary, the main problem is the energy and computation costs of neural network explanations, and the key questions are around developing more efficient empirical explainers that can approximate expensive explanation methods. The overall motivation appears to be making neural network explainability more environmentally friendly and sustainable.

This paper proposes a method called Empirical Explainers to efficiently generate approximate explanations for complex machine learning models. The key idea is to train a separate neural network model called an Empirical Explainer to predict the attribution maps that would be generated by a more expensive explanation method like Integrated Gradients or Shapley Values.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using Empirical Explainers to efficiently approximate computationally expensive explainability methods like Integrated Gradients and Shapley Values. Empirical Explainers are models trained on data to predict the attribution maps of expensive explainers, requiring just a single pass through the Empirical Explainer versus multiple passes through the full model for the expensive methods. Experiments in the language domain show Empirical Explainers can model expensive explainers surprisingly well at a fraction of the computational cost, indicating they could help mitigate the high costs of neural explanations where approximation errors are acceptable. The paper argues this is an important direction for "greener" explainable AI, since many popular explainability techniques have high computational burdens that can exceed model training and inference costs in production if explanations are needed for most predictions. Overall, the paper introduces Empirical Explainers as an efficient way to approximate expensive explanations while still providing useful feature attributions.
