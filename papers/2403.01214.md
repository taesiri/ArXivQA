# [Boosting Box-supervised Instance Segmentation with Pseudo Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Instance segmentation aims to classify and segment objects, but requires extensive pixel-level mask annotations which are costly to acquire. Weak box supervision can reduce annotation efforts, but lacks detailed shape and region information leading to poor performance. 

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce pseudo-depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf depth predictor to provide coarse 3D shape cues to aid the mask prediction process and distinguish foreground regions. Specifically:

1) Integrate a depth estimation layer into the mask prediction head to jointly predict masks and depth. This enables the network to perceive depth features for improved segmentation. 

2) Apply a depth consistency loss to enforce the network to produce consistent predictions for regions with similar depth, thereby exploiting depth coherence within objects.

3) Incorporate depth in mask assignment during self-distillation through a proposed depth matching score. This selects higher quality masks for refinement.

Main Contributions:
- Propose using readily available coarse pseudo-depth maps to improve mask prediction in box-supervised segmentation
- Design a depth-guided mask prediction head to jointly predict masks and depth
- Introduce depth consistency loss and depth-aware mask assignment to leverage depth cues
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on COCO and Cityscapes under box supervision constraints, demonstrating the ability to boost segmentation networks by exploiting depth

In summary, this work effectively utilizes pseudo-depth maps to overcome box supervision limitations in instance segmentation. By guiding the network to perceive and exploit depth features, mask prediction quality is significantly enhanced, leading to notable performance gains under weak box-level supervision constraints.
