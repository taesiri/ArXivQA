# [REAL: Representation Enhanced Analytic Learning for Exemplar-free   Class-incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13522)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Class-incremental learning (CIL) allows models to continuously learn from new data without accessing previous data. However, CIL suffers from catastrophic forgetting where the model forgets previously learned knowledge upon learning new information. Existing solutions either store previous data samples (replay-based methods) or impose constraints on model parameters (regularization-based methods), both having limitations. Recently, analytic learning (AL) based CIL has shown promise by reformulating CIL as a recursive least squares problem, but relies on a frozen feature extractor which limits representation discriminability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Representation Enhanced Analytic Learning (REAL) for exemplar-free CIL. REAL enhances the feature extractor's representations while retaining the benefits of AL-based CIL. It consists of:

1) Dual-stream base pretraining (DS-BPT): Pretrains the backbone via both supervised learning and self-supervised contrastive learning to acquire general knowledge. 

2) Representation enhancing distillation (RED): Transfers label knowledge from the supervised model to the self-supervised model to adapt and enhance representations.

3) Analytic CIL: Conducts CIL by recursively solving a least squares problem to update the classifier, achieving performance on par with joint training.

By enhancing representations while retaining analytic learning benefits, REAL achieves both stability in preserving old knowledge and plasticity in learning new concepts.

Contributions:
- Proposes REAL framework to enhance representations for AL-based exemplar-free CIL
- DS-BPT provides general knowledge for transferability and adaptability  
- RED enriches representations with label knowledge while retaining generality
- Experiments show REAL outperforms state-of-the-art EFCIL methods and is comparable with replay-based methods
- Ablations verify contributions of enhanced representations to both stability and plasticity

In summary, this paper presents a novel algorithm to address limitations of existing AL-based CIL by enhancing representations, while retaining desirable properties of analytic learning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art techniques.
