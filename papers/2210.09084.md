# [Multi-Agent Automated Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09084)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: How to effectively optimize different modules in an automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline in a joint manner? 

The key hypothesis is that modeling the AutoML modules as cooperative agents in a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework can enable effective joint optimization of the modules.

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called Multi-Agent Automated Machine Learning (MA2ML). The key ideas are:

- Model each AutoML module (e.g. data augmentation, neural architecture search, hyperparameter optimization) as an agent. The joint action of all agents defines an ML pipeline. 

- Use the final validation accuracy as the shared reward to train all agents jointly using MARL.

- Introduce credit assignment to differentiate each agent's contribution to the shared reward.

- Employ off-policy RL to improve sample efficiency.

The hypothesis is that by modeling the cooperative relationship between AutoML modules and using techniques like credit assignment and off-policy RL, MA2ML can achieve effective joint optimization and improve end-to-end performance of ML pipelines. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR validate this hypothesis and show state-of-the-art results.

In summary, the central research question is how to achieve effective joint optimization of AutoML modules. The key hypothesis is that modeling it as a cooperative MARL problem with credit assignment and off-policy RL can enable joint optimization and improve pipeline performance.
