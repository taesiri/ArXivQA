# [Software Vulnerability and Functionality Assessment using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08429)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Code reviews are an integral part of software development, but can be tedious and costly. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can aid in automating parts of code reviews, specifically in (i) flagging security vulnerabilities and (ii) validating functionality against requirements.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors experiment with 3 proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, Text-Davinci) and 6 smaller open-source LLMs on code snippets from 3 datasets: HumanEval, MBPP for clean code, and SecurityEval containing expert-written vulnerable code. 

For vulnerability detection, they use a zero-shot prompt to classify snippets as having vulnerabilities or not. For functionality validation, they validate whether snippets meet their documented functionality through a second zero-shot prompt. They also combine both tasks through chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, they evaluate whether models can describe the detected vulnerabilities.

Main Contributions:

- The proprietary models substantially outperform the smaller open-source models on all tasks. GPT-4 achieves 96% accuracy on detecting vulnerabilities. The top models also exceed 88% on functionally validating code.

- Chain-of-thought prompting improves performance over zero-shot prompting alone when combining vulnerability detection and functionality validation.

- GPT-4 generated vulnerability descriptions that could be matched to real vulnerabilities 37% of the time, showing promise in providing actionable feedback.

In summary, the results demonstrate that large proprietary LLMs show promise in automating parts of code reviews, but smaller open-source models still have substantial room for improvement on these tasks. The paper provides a methodology for evaluating LLMs on code quality and security.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates whether large language models can aid with code reviews by flagging security vulnerabilities and validating software functionality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an experimental framework to investigate how large language models (LLMs) can aid in code reviews, with a focus on two key tasks: (1) flagging code with security vulnerabilities and (2) performing software functionality validation to ensure code meets its intended functionality. 

The paper tests the performance of several proprietary LLMs from OpenAI as well as smaller open-source LLMs on these tasks using datasets of code snippets. The results show that the proprietary models, especially GPT-4, significantly outperform the open-source models in accurately flagging vulnerabilities and validating functionality. The paper also demonstrates that GPT-4 can provide reasonably accurate natural language descriptions of identified vulnerabilities over 36% of the time.

In summary, the paper's experiments demonstrate promising capabilities of large proprietary LLMs to automate aspects of code reviews, especially security checks and functional validation. The main contribution is developing and evaluating an approach to apply modern LLMs to a practical software engineering challenge.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes both open-source and proprietary LLMs. What are the key differences between these models in terms of performance on the proposed tasks? What factors might explain the differences?

2. The paper employs zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and multi-class zero-shot prompting approaches. How do these approaches work and what are their relative merits and limitations? 

3. The paper applies perturbations to code snippets between experimental runs. What is the motivation for this and what effect does this have on the robustness of the results?

4. For the software functionality validation task, the paper uses nearest neighbor search to construct "wrong but similar" task descriptions. What is the intuition behind this approach and what are its limitations?  

5. The paper matches LLM-generated vulnerability descriptions to CWE vulnerabilities using cosine similarity. What are the limitations of this approach and how might the mappings be further improved?

6. What threats to internal and external validity does the paper identify and how might future work address these?

7. The paper focuses on code snippets with single functions. How might the approach be extended to larger codebases and what challenges might this introduce?

8. The paper uses datasets with a small proportion of vulnerable code snippets. How would results likely change if applied to more realistic datasets and why?

9. The paper considers general purpose LLMs. How might specialized models for code compare and why?  

10. The paper focuses on two core aspects of code reviews. What other aspects could the approach be extended to cover and what challenges might this introduce?
