# [Reduce Information Loss in Transformers for Pluralistic Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05076)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to reduce information loss in transformers for pluralistic image inpainting. Specifically, the paper identifies two main sources of information loss in existing transformer-based image inpainting methods:1. Downsampling the input image to lower resolutions, which causes loss of fine details and misalignment of region boundaries when upsampling back to the original resolution. 2. Quantizing the RGB pixel values into a small number of discrete tokens before feeding into the transformer. This causes loss of information in the pixel values.To address these issues, the paper proposes two key solutions:1. A patch-based autoencoder called P-VQVAE that encodes the image into non-overlapping patches at the original resolution, avoiding downsampling. It uses a dual codebook to separately represent masked and unmasked patches. 2. An unquantized transformer (UQ-Transformer) that takes the continuous encoder features as input without quantization and only uses quantized tokens as prediction targets. This avoids information loss during transformer processing.The overall framework combines P-VQVAE and UQ-Transformer to maximize information retention for the transformer, in order to achieve better fidelity and diversity for pluralistic image inpainting, especially on complex images and large masked regions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new transformer-based framework called PUT for pluralistic image inpainting. PUT contains two key components:- P-VQVAE: A patch-based autoencoder that converts the input image into non-overlapped patch tokens using an encoder, quantizes the patch tokens with a dual-codebook, and reconstructs the image from the quantized tokens using a decoder. This avoids input image downsampling and disturbance between masked and unmasked regions.- UQ-Transformer: A transformer that takes the unquantized features from P-VQVAE encoder as input and predicts quantized tokens as targets. This avoids the information loss caused by feature quantization.2. Compared to existing methods, PUT reduces the information loss from the input image in two aspects:- By using a patch-based encoder, it avoids input downsampling and thus preserving full resolution information.- By feeding unquantized features to the transformer, it avoids quantization loss.3. Extensive experiments show PUT achieves state-of-the-art performance on image fidelity and diversity, especially for large masks and complex datasets. It outperforms previous transformer-based methods by a large margin.4. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed P-VQVAE and UQ-Transformer components. The unquantized transformer is shown to be critical for preserving information and achieving high inpainting quality.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the PUT framework that reduces information loss compared to prior arts by avoiding input downsampling and feature quantization, leading to improved performance on pluralistic image inpainting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from this paper:The paper proposes a new transformer-based image inpainting method called PUT that uses a patch-based autoencoder (P-VQVAE) and an unquantized transformer (UQ-Transformer) to process high-resolution images without downsampling or quantization, in order to reduce information loss and achieve better synthesis results compared to prior methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a new transformer-based approach for pluralistic image inpainting. Here are some key ways it compares to other recent work in this field:- It focuses on reducing information loss in transformers for inpainting. Many recent inpainting papers use transformers, but the authors argue these have issues with downsampling input images and quantizing pixels into discrete tokens. Their method aims to avoid these issues.- It proposes a patch-based autoencoder (P-VQVAE) and an unquantized transformer (UQ-Transformer). The autoencoder converts the image into patch tokens while avoiding downsampling. The transformer takes continuous features as input instead of discrete tokens to avoid quantization loss. - Experiments show it outperforms recent CNN and transformer methods, especially for large masks and complex datasets like ImageNet. The results suggest avoiding downsampling and quantization helps preserve information and generate higher fidelity inpaintings.- Most prior transformer inpainting methods rely on an additional CNN for upsampling and refinement. Their approach avoids this by operating directly on high-res images in the P-VQVAE.- For diversity, it uses a sampling strategy based on Gibbs sampling, similar to recent transformer image generation models.- The limitations are mainly the inference speed due to the auto-regressive transformer, which is common for such models. And it may sometimes generate artifacts like color distortion.Overall, this paper demonstrates the advantages of avoiding downsampling and quantization in transformers for inpainting. The proposed techniques seem effective for reducing information loss, leading to improved fidelity and diversity compared to recent methods. It provides a new direction for leveraging transformers in image inpainting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:- Improving inference speed of transformer-based auto-regressive methods like PUT. They note the main limitation currently is slow sampling speed to generate multiple diverse results. They suggest exploring more efficient transformer architectures or sampling strategies. - Mitigating potential misuse cases of generating manipulated images, such as using existing synthesized image detectors.- Exploring variants and extensions of the P-VQVAE and UQ-Transformer architectures. For example, using different encoder, decoder, and transformer designs tailored for image inpainting.- Applying the core ideas of PUT - using patch-based processing and continuous representation learning - to other vision tasks beyond just inpainting.- Evaluating PUT on higher resolution images beyond 256x256 pixels. The authors note it can likely be scaled up.- Comparing to other recent state-of-the-art methods like CoModGAN and LaMa on benchmark datasets.- Mitigating artifacts like color distortion and black regions that can sometimes occur in PUT's results.- Exploring unconditioned image generation with PUT by sampling latent codes, rather than conditioned inpainting.In summary, the main future directions are improving efficiency,scaling up resolution, reducing artifacts, comparing to latest methods, and extending the approach to other tasks and image generation settings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper: The paper proposes a new transformer-based framework called PUT for pluralistic image inpainting. The framework contains two main components - a Patch-based Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (P-VQVAE) and an Un-Quantized Transformer (UQ-Transformer). P-VQVAE converts the input image into non-overlapping patch tokens using its encoder, and reconstructs the masked image regions while keeping unmasked regions unchanged using its decoder. This avoids disturbance between masked and unmasked regions. UQ-Transformer takes the continuous feature vectors from P-VQVAE as input without quantization and only uses quantized vectors as prediction targets. Compared to using quantized tokens as input, this avoids information loss and enables better prediction. Experiments on FFHQ, Places2 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate PUT's superiority over existing methods, especially for large masked regions and complex datasets. The main benefits are attributed to using high-resolution input without quantization, which preserves maximal information to generate high fidelity results.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new transformer-based framework called PUT for pluralistic image inpainting. The framework consists of two main components - P-VQVAE and UQ-Transformer. P-VQVAE is a specially designed patch auto-encoder with a patch-based encoder, dual-codebook, and multi-scale guided decoder. The patch-based encoder converts the input image into non-overlapped patch tokens to avoid disturbance between masked and unmasked regions. The dual-codebook separately represents masked and unmasked patches with different codebooks to learn more discriminative features. The multi-scale guided decoder reconstructs the image by utilizing unmasked regions as references. UQ-Transformer takes the continuous features from P-VQVAE as input without quantization and only uses the quantized tokens as prediction targets. This avoids the information loss caused by quantization in previous methods.The method is evaluated on FFHQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets. Results show it outperforms existing CNN and transformer based pluralistic inpainting methods, especially for large masks and complex scenes. The main advantage is attributed to processing high-resolution images without quantization, which preserves more information to generate realistic results. The limitation is the slower inference speed compared to previous transformer solutions due to the auto-regressive sampling. Overall, the proposed PUT effectively reduces information loss in transformers and achieves new state-of-the-art performance for pluralistic image inpainting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a new transformer-based framework for pluralistic image inpainting called PUT. The key components are:1) Patch-based Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (P-VQVAE). It contains a patch-based encoder to convert the image into non-overlapping patch tokens, a dual-codebook to quantize masked and unmasked patches separately, and a decoder to reconstruct the image while keeping unmasked regions unchanged. 2) Un-Quantized Transformer (UQ-Transformer). It takes the continuous features from P-VQVAE encoder as input without quantization to avoid information loss. The quantized tokens are only used as prediction targets.To summarize, P-VQVAE avoids downsampling the input image so the transformer can work at original resolution. The patch-based design also prevents interference between masked and unmasked regions. Meanwhile, UQ-Transformer removes the quantization of inputs to reduce information loss. Experiments show PUT outperforms previous methods, especially for large masks and complex datasets.
