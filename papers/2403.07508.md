# [MoAI: Mixture of All Intelligence for Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current large language and vision models (LLVMs) have not fully leveraged detailed and comprehensive real-world scene understanding available from specialized computer vision (CV) models for visual perception tasks like segmentation, detection, scene graph generation, and OCR. Instead, they rely mainly on large model capacity and emergent capabilities of language model backbones. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new LLVM called \textbf{M}ixture \textbf{o}f \textbf{A}ll \textbf{I}ntelligence (\includegraphics[width=0.025\textwidth]{figure/moai.pdf} \textbf{MoAI}) that utilizes auxiliary visual information from external CV models - segmentation, detection, scene graph, and OCR models. Two new modules are introduced: 

1) \textit{MoAI-Compressor}: Aligns and condenses verbalized outputs of CV models into efficient auxiliary features.

2) \textit{MoAI-Mixer}: Blends visual, auxiliary, and language features using the concept of Mixture of Experts with 6 expert modules (cross- and self-attentions) and gating networks.

This allows MoAI to effectively leverage comprehensive real-world scene understanding for complex question answering without scaling up model or dataset size.

Main Contributions:

1) Introduces a way for LLVMs to utilize diverse auxiliary visual information from specialized external CV models.

2) MoAI significantly enhances visual perception capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot VL performance by blending multiple intelligence sources, demonstrating the importance of comprehensive real-world scene understanding.

In summary, the paper presents a novel LLVM architecture that leverages external CV models and blends multi-modal intelligence to achieve exceptional visual perception ability and overall VL performance without requiring additional model/data scaling.
