# [Going Beyond Word Matching: Syntax Improves In-context Example Selection   for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19285)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In-context learning (ICL) is a popular prompting strategy for large language models (LLMs) where example demonstrations are provided in the context to elicit the model's capabilities on a task without finetuning. 
- Selecting good examples is crucial for the effectiveness of ICL. 
- For machine translation (MT), prior works on example selection use superficial word-level features while ignoring syntactic information.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a syntax-based method to select examples for ICL on MT by computing syntactic similarity between dependency parse trees using Polynomial Distance. 
- Also propose an ensemble strategy that combines examples selected by both word-level similarity (BM25) and syntax-level similarity (Polynomial Distance).

Main Contributions:
- First work to incorporate syntactic information for in-context example selection on MT.
- Show that syntax helps find better examples and improve MT quality under ICL setting.
- Proposed methods obtain highest COMET scores on 11 out of 12 translation directions between English and 6 languages.
- Demonstrate that combining word-level and syntax-level criteria for example selection is an effective ensemble strategy.
- Highlight the importance of syntactic information for syntax-rich tasks like MT when using ICL.

In summary, this paper introduces a syntax-based method and an ensemble technique for selecting in-context examples to improve MT performance without any finetuning. The key insight is that syntactic similarity is as important as word-level similarity for finding useful demonstrations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a syntax-based in-context example selection method for machine translation that computes the syntactic similarity between dependency trees using Polynomial Distance, and also presents an effective ensemble strategy combining examples selected by both word-level and syntax-level criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel syntax-based in-context example selection strategy for machine translation, which selects examples most similar to the test source sentence in terms of syntactic similarity based on polynomial distance between dependency trees. 

2) It presents an ensemble strategy to combine in-context examples selected from different criteria (word-level overlap and syntactic similarity), taking advantage of both types of signals.

3) Through experiments on English-X translation (X = German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Russian, Chinese), it shows that incorporating syntactic information is effective in finding better in-context examples and improving the performance of language models on machine translation when using the in-context learning prompting strategy.

In summary, the key contribution is using syntax to enhance in-context example selection for machine translation, and showing that syntax can improve language models' ability for this task. The paper calls for more attention to be paid to syntactic knowledge when applying language models.

To summarize, this paper explores using syntax-based features to select informative in-context examples to improve machine translation performance of large language models through in-context learning. It proposes selecting similar examples based on dependency tree similarity measured by polynomial distance. It also proposes an ensemble strategy to combine word-level and syntax-level example selections. The key focus is on using syntactic information to find better examples for eliciting the translation abilities of large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a syntax-based in-context example selection method for machine translation. How exactly is the syntactic similarity between dependency trees computed using Polynomial Distance? Can you explain the steps in detail?

2. The paper also proposes an ensemble strategy that combines examples selected by both word-level and syntax-level criteria. What is the intuition behind this ensemble strategy? Why would combining these two types of examples help improve performance?

3. When converting dependency trees to polynomials, the paper uses two variable sets X and Y. What do these variable sets represent and why are two separate sets needed to encode the tree structure? 

4. The computation of the Polynomial Distance relies on representing the polynomials as sets of term vectors. What exactly constitutes a term vector here and how is the distance computed using these term vectors?

5. The paper experiments with 6 different languages - German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Russian and Chinese. Are there any differences in how effective the proposed syntax-based method is across these languages? Why might we expect differences?

6. Could the proposed syntax-based selection method be applied to other natural language processing tasks beyond machine translation? What challenges might arise in adapting this approach to other tasks?

7. The paper compares against several baselines including BM25, R-BM25 and a prior method CTQScorer. What are the key differences between the proposed approach and these baseline methods for example selection?

8. How sensitive is the performance of the syntax-based selection approach to the choice of dependency parser? Have the authors experimented with different parsers and if so what differences were observed?

9. Have the authors experimented with any alternative tree similarity metrics besides Polynomial Distance? If so, how did they compare in determining syntactic similarity for this application?

10. The ensemble strategy in the paper simply concatenates examples from BM25 and Polynomial Distance selections. Could more sophisticated ensemble approaches be beneficial, e.g. learning weighted combinations?
