# [Cobra Effect in Reference-Free Image Captioning Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11572)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing reference-free image captioning metrics demonstrate high correlation with human judgment, but may still have unknown flaws. This paper investigates whether using these metrics as rewards to guide caption generation can expose deficiencies.

- Experiments using mainstream reference-free metrics as rewards improve metrics scores but result in incoherent and repetitive captions, indicating flaws in properly evaluating these issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- A new Self-Improving method that uses problematic captions generated by the metrics during reinforcement learning as negative examples to retrain the metrics. This allows the metrics to self-discover issues and self-repair.

- Retrained metrics are then used to provide better rewards to guide caption generation, resulting in higher quality and more coherent descriptions based on GPT-4V evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- Discloses flaws in existing reference-free image captioning metrics when used as rewards, despite high human correlation.

- Introduces a Self-Improving technique to identify problematic captions and retrain metrics to address deficiencies. Achieves state-of-the-art GPT-4V scores.  

- Presents a new Flaws Caption benchmark to evaluate robustness of metrics against various caption interferences. Self-Improving method substantially outperforms existing metrics.

In summary, this paper conducts an in-depth investigation into potential flaws of reference-free image captioning metrics. The key innovation is a Self-Improving method that enables metrics to self-discover and resolve their own vulnerabilities through retraining on problematic negative examples. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
