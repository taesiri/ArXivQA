# [AI in Supply Chain Risk Assessment: A Systematic Literature Review and   Bibliometric Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in supply chain risk assessment (SCRA). 

The paper first provides background on supply chain disruptions and the critical need for effective risk assessment and management, especially in light of major events like the COVID-19 pandemic. It discusses the limitations of traditional SCRA methods and the potential for AI techniques like machine learning to enhance predictive capabilities. 

Four key research questions are then formulated to guide the literature review: (1) current state of research on AI/ML in SCRA, (2) common AI/ML techniques used, (3) key findings and trends, and (4) research gaps and future directions.

The authors conduct a rigorous SLR methodology, searching major databases and applying inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify 48 high-quality research articles for analysis. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis is also performed using visualization tools to uncover publication trends, influential authors/journals, etc.

The review explores various AI techniques applied in SCRA, like neural networks, SVM, ensemble methods like Random Forest, deep learning models, and hybrid approaches. A table summarizes the techniques and key metrics/findings from the literature. The paper discusses managerial implications, emphasizing integration of advanced ML models to bolster risk assessment accuracy.

The limitations of data availability, model interpretability, and dynamic risk factors are highlighted. Future research directions are proposed around improving model explainability, using hybrid AI approaches, democratizing supply chain data access, and developing adaptive real-time risk assessment models.

In conclusion, this SLR makes valuable contributions by reviewing the AI/ML application landscape in SCRA, identifying pivotal trends and techniques, outlining research gaps, and providing a roadmap to fortify risk management strategies leveraging AI. The managerial insights offer practical guidance for supply chain professionals seeking to integrate AI-driven solutions.
