# [A general approach to enhance the survivability of backdoor attacks by   decision path coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Backdoor attacks inject hidden vulnerabilities into deep neural networks (DNNs) during training, allowing attackers to misclassify samples with specific trigger patterns at test time. Mainstream defenses attempt to eliminate backdoors via model reconstruction techniques like unlearning or pruning. However, existing attacks lack survivability against such defenses. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Venom, a novel generic enhancer that improves the survivability of existing backdoor attacks against model reconstruction defenses, without compromising attack effectiveness or model utility. 

Key ideas:
1) Formulate the enhancement as a binary-task optimization problem with two goals: preserve original attack capability (task 1) and improve attack survivability (task 2).

2) For task 2, generate the target crucial decision path (TCDP) from a clean model that is important for classifying benign samples. 

3) Propose a novel attention imitation loss that forces the decision paths and activations of poisoned samples in the backdoored model to couple with the TCDP. This makes the backdoor difficult to eliminate without sacrificing classification accuracy.

Main Contributions:
1) First generic approach to enhance existing attack survivability against model reconstruction defenses.

2) Extensive evaluation with 8 attacks and 8 defenses on 2 DNNs and 3 datasets shows Venom significantly improves attack survivability from 39.10% to 62.45% on average.

3) Open source the implementation to facilitate future research.

The key innovation is formulating enhancement as a binary task optimization problem and using attention imitation loss to tightly couple the backdoor with model utility. By forcing overlap between benign and poisoned samples' decision paths, Venom makes defenses ineffective without largely decreasing accuracy.
