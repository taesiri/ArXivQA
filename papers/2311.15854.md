# [A systematic study comparing hyperparameter optimization engines on   tabular data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15854)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an extensive comparison of 11 major hyperparameter optimization (hyperopt) engines on tabular data, using the Ray Tune library which provides a unified API. The methodology involves precomputing a grid search to enable running a large number of trials across 5 models and 5 datasets. Two metrics are introduced for evaluation: a rank-based metric measuring if engines beat random search, and a score-based metric quantifying improvement over random search. The results reveal that most engines outperform random search, but 3 engines clearly stand out as top performers - Huawei's HEBO, Microsoft's BlendSearch, and Meta's AX. On average, the top engines accelerate random search by 2-3x or reduce the gap to full grid search by 50%. An interesting finding is that some engines seem to specialize for certain models, making model comparisons sensitive to the choice of hyperopt engine. The paper provides useful practical guidelines for choosing an optimization engine, and highlights the need for larger scale studies on real-world datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically compares 11 hyperparameter optimization engines on 5 models and 5 tabular datasets, finding that HEBO, BlendSearch, and AX consistently perform the best, while some engines specialize in optimizing certain models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

1) Running an independent comparison of all hyperparameter optimization (hyperopt) engines available in the Ray Tune library. This is an experimental integration study rather than introducing a new technique.

2) Introducing two ways to normalize and aggregate statistics across data sets and models to compare the engines:
- A rank-based metric that answers the question: what is the probability an engine performs better than random search? 
- A score-based metric that measures how much the engines improve over random search on a scale normalized between random search and full grid search.

3) Using these metrics to rank the engines, determine how much they improve over random search, and make recommendations on which engine works best with different learning algorithms. 

4) Key findings that most engines beat random search (with three standing out: HEBO, AX, and BlendSearch), and that some engines specialize in optimizing certain models, making it tricky to use hyperopt engines in comparison studies between models.

So in summary, the main contribution is running a systematic study to compare various hyperparameter optimization engines on tabular data using robust experimental methodology and metrics.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that discretizing the hyperparameters can make algorithms simpler and more robust. Do you think there are cases where continuous hyperparameters would be preferable? What types of problems might benefit more from continuous spaces?

2. The overall ranking of the hyperparameter optimization engines shows HEBO, BlendSearch, and AX as the top performers. Based on the description of these methods, what factors do you think contribute most to their strong performance? 

3. The paper finds that some engines specialize in optimizing certain types of models, like BayesOpt performing well on tree-based methods. Why do you think this specialization occurs for some techniques but not others? 

4. What are the potential drawbacks of using a predefined grid search space instead of allowing the optimization methods to freely explore? When would the restrictions of a grid search outweigh the benefits described in the paper?

5. How could the performance comparison be extended to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each optimization engine? What additional experiments or analysis would you suggest?  

6. The paper argues that the training set size used is relevant for many real-world problems. Do you think the conclusions would change significantly on much larger datasets? Why or why not?

7. The two evaluation metrics measure different things - ranking probability and score improvement over random search. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each metric? When would one be preferred over the other?

8. The paper finds that HEBO, AX, and BlendSearch can accelerate random search by 2-3x. Is this a significant real-world improvement in your view? What problems might still benefit from better optimizations?

9. The results find that only 3 out of 11 engines clearly outperform random search. Why do you think developing better performing hyperparameter optimization is so challenging?

10. The paper studies sequential optimization methods. How suitable do you think these conclusions are for parallel/distributed hyperparameter tuning settings? What changes might need to be made?
