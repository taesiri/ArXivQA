# [Generating Aligned Pseudo-Supervision from Non-Aligned Data for Image   Restoration in Under-Display Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06019)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high-quality and well-aligned pseudo training pairs for under-display camera (UDC) image restoration. The key idea is to learn to "copy" details from a high-quality reference image and "paste" them onto the corresponding UDC image in a spatially aligned manner.

The main hypothesis is that using such pseudo training pairs generated from real non-aligned stereo data will lead to improved performance and generalizability for UDC image restoration networks compared to previous approaches like using synthetic data or unpaired training schemes.

To test this hypothesis, the authors propose AlignFormer, a Transformer-based framework to generate aligned pseudo pairs by mitigating both the domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment between UDC and reference images. The effectiveness of the generated pseudo pairs is then evaluated by training a baseline restoration network and comparing against other datasets and methods.

In summary, the central research question is how to create high-quality spatially aligned pseudo pairs from non-aligned real stereo data to improve UDC image restoration. The key hypothesis is that AlignFormer can generate such useful training data better than previous approaches.
