# Human-AI Collaboration: The Effect of AI Delegation on Human Task   Performance and Task Satisfaction

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is studying the effect of AI delegation on human task performance and task satisfaction in a controlled experiment. Specifically, the paper finds that:- AI delegation improves human task performance compared to humans or AI working alone. The combined human-AI team performance exceeds the individual performance of both. - AI delegation increases human task satisfaction compared to humans working alone.- Increased self-efficacy mediates the positive effects of AI delegation on task performance and satisfaction. In other words, AI delegation boosts people's confidence in their abilities, which in turn improves performance and satisfaction.- The positive effects occur regardless of whether the human is aware of the AI delegation taking place. The paper proposes a behavioral model based on organizational research and tests it in an experiment with image classification. Overall, it provides initial evidence that AI delegation can be an effective form of human-AI collaboration, with benefits for both task performance and human perceptions like satisfaction. The findings highlight the potential of allowing AI models to take on more management responsibilities in workplaces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents an experimental study showing that AI delegation of task instances improves human task performance and satisfaction by increasing self-efficacy, regardless of whether the human is aware of the delegation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on human-AI collaboration and AI delegation:- The paper provides an experimental study validating the benefits of AI delegation for improving human task performance and task satisfaction. Prior work has mainly studied AI delegation through simulations with synthetic or context-independent human predictions.- It investigates the underlying mechanism (self-efficacy) explaining why AI delegation improves task outcomes. Most prior work focused only on the direct effects of AI delegation on performance. - The study designs the delegation algorithm to learn both the AI model's and the human's capabilities. Some previous experiments used simpler algorithms that do not account for the human.- It examines both the effect of actual delegation by the AI as well as communicating the delegation. Many studies did not distinguish these two aspects. - The paper studies the effect of AI delegation on task satisfaction, going beyond just task performance. Considering perceptions like satisfaction is still rare in research on human-AI collaboration.- It uses a generic image classification task and non-expert participants. Most work in human-AI collaboration, including on AI delegation, relies on specialized high-stakes tasks and domain experts.Overall, this paper provides an extensive experimental analysis of AI delegation, investigating its effect on multiple outcomes of interest through an underlying mechanism. It expands the current understanding of human-AI collaboration by considering additional perceptual factors beyond just task performance. The experimental approach using a generic task likely provides more generalizable insights compared to studies using specialized high-stakes tasks and experts.
