# Human-AI Collaboration: The Effect of AI Delegation on Human Task   Performance and Task Satisfaction

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is studying the effect of AI delegation on human task performance and task satisfaction in a controlled experiment. Specifically, the paper finds that:- AI delegation improves human task performance compared to humans or AI working alone. The combined human-AI team performance exceeds the individual performance of both. - AI delegation increases human task satisfaction compared to humans working alone.- Increased self-efficacy mediates the positive effects of AI delegation on task performance and satisfaction. In other words, AI delegation boosts people's confidence in their abilities, which in turn improves performance and satisfaction.- The positive effects occur regardless of whether the human is aware of the AI delegation taking place. The paper proposes a behavioral model based on organizational research and tests it in an experiment with image classification. Overall, it provides initial evidence that AI delegation can be an effective form of human-AI collaboration, with benefits for both task performance and human perceptions like satisfaction. The findings highlight the potential of allowing AI models to take on more management responsibilities in workplaces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents an experimental study showing that AI delegation of task instances improves human task performance and satisfaction by increasing self-efficacy, regardless of whether the human is aware of the delegation.
