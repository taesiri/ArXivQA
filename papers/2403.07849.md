## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Iterative Graph Neural Network Enhancement via Frequent Subgraph Mining of Explanations":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have limited representation power due to the restrictions of the Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) algorithm. Extending their power is an important challenge.
- One approach is to add structural information as node features, e.g. by counting subgraph patterns. However, selecting useful patterns is difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the Explanation Enhanced Graph Learning (EEGL) system for iterative enhancement of GNNs using explanations. 
- EEGL has four main modules: GNN learning, node explainer, pattern extraction, and feature annotation. It works iteratively.
- In each round, it first trains a GNN model. Then it generates an explanation subgraph for each node using GNNExplainer. 
- It mines frequent subgraph patterns from the explanations for each class. The top patterns are selected and used to annotate nodes with new features.
- In the next round, the enhanced features are used to retrain the GNN. This process repeats.

Contributions:
- Provides an automated, application-dependent solution to select useful GNN subgraph patterns from explanations. This was posed as an open problem.
- Applies frequent connected subgraph mining to explanations for model improvement.
- Proposes a general framework for iterative enhancement of GNNs using explanations.
- Empirically evaluates EEGL on synthetic and real graphs. Shows it can iteratively improve itself and outperform baselines.
- Analyzes the effect of different relationships between 1-WL symmetries and label partitions.

In summary, the paper provides a novel XAI-based approach for enhancing representation power and prediction performance of graph neural networks. The explanation-driven feature enrichment allows going beyond limitations of standard GNNs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an approach called Explanation Enhanced Graph Learning (EEGL) to iteratively improve graph neural networks for node classification by using frequent subgraph mining to extract meaningful patterns from explanation subgraphs and incorporate them as node features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called Explanation Enhanced Graph Learning (EEGL) for iteratively enhancing the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification. Specifically, EEGL utilizes explanations from a GNN model to extract frequent subgraph patterns, selects useful patterns, and uses them to define new node features. This allows augmenting the node distinguishing power and representation capacity of the original GNN model. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs, the paper shows that EEGL can iteratively improve GNN models, outperforming other feature initialization methods and a subgraph-based GNN model. A key aspect is providing an automated, application-dependent solution to the problem of selecting useful graph patterns to extend GNNs, which has been posed as an open problem previously. Overall, the main novelty is using an explainability-driven approach to overcome inherent limitations of GNNs via self-improvement.

The main focus of the paper is on using explanations from graph neural networks to iteratively improve their predictive performance via frequent subgraph mining. Key ideas include extracting patterns from explanation subgraphs, using those patterns to define new features, and retraining the model in an iterative fashion. The method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world graph datasets.

Some other key terms that come up in the paper include different graph symmetry types, the node distinguishing power of GNNs, comparisons to other subgraph-based methods like shaDow-GNN, and an analysis of the training dynamics. But the main key ideas have to do with using XAI and frequent subgraph mining to improve GNN models.
