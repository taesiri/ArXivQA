# [A minimal coalition logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14704)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Coalition Logic (CL) is used for strategic reasoning, but its models (concurrent game models) make three assumptions that are too strong: independence of agents, seriality, and determinism. 
- Independence of agents means joint actions of disjoint coalitions can always be merged. But some joint actions are conditional on other agents' simultaneous actions.  
- Seriality means coalitions always have available joint actions. But sometimes there are no actions, like when a game terminates.
- Determinism of the grand coalition's joint actions does not always hold either.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a minimal coalition logic called MCL based on more general concurrent game models that do not assume independence of agents, seriality or determinism. 
- Give semantics and axiom system for completeness of MCL.
- Compare MCL to CL. Formulas and validities differ due to the dropped assumptions.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and argue against three assumptions of CL models: independence of agents, seriality and determinism.  
- Define general concurrent game models without these assumptions.
- Develop a Minimal Coalition Logic (MCL) sound and complete over the more general class of models.
- Show how validities differ between MCL and CL due to differences in models.
- MCL seems to be a minimal logic for strategic reasoning without unnecessarily strong assumptions.

In summary, the paper identifies and relaxes three assumptions of Coalition Logic that are too strong for representing all strategic scenarios. It develops a Minimal Coalition Logic over more general models without those assumptions and shows it is sound and complete.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a minimal coalition logic MCL based on general concurrent game models without the assumptions of independence of agents, seriality, and determinism that are present in standard Coalition Logic CL.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It argues that the standard models of Coalition Logic (concurrent game models) make three assumptions that are too strong: independence of agents, seriality, and determinism. It provides examples showing that these assumptions do not always hold. 

2) It presents a new logic called Minimal Coalition Logic (MCL) which is based on more general models (general concurrent game models) that do not make those three assumptions.

3) It formally defines the syntax, semantics, and axiomatization of MCL and shows that it is sound and complete. 

4) It compares MCL to standard Coalition Logic, highlighting the key differences in terms of validity of certain formulas. It argues that MCL seems to be a "minimal" coalition logic for strategic reasoning by giving up those three assumptions.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting and analyzing a more general coalition logic that relaxes some of the strong assumptions typically made in models of strategic reasoning. The paper shows this minimal logic is still complete while allowing more flexibility in modeling real-world strategic scenarios.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Coalition Logic (CL)
- Concurrent game models
- Independence of agents
- Seriality 
- Determinism
- General concurrent game models
- Minimal coalition logic (MCL)
- Soundness and completeness

The paper discusses Coalition Logic (CL), which is used for strategic reasoning, and argues that the concurrent game models used to model CL make three assumptions that are too strong - independence of agents, seriality, and determinism. The paper then presents a minimal coalition logic (MCL) based on more general concurrent game models that do not make these assumptions. It compares MCL to CL, and proves the soundness and completeness of MCL. So the key focus is on logics for strategic reasoning, differences in assumptions between models, and properties of the logics such as completeness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper argues that concurrent game models make three assumptions that are too strong - independence of agents, seriality, and determinism. Can you elaborate on why exactly each of these assumptions is problematic and provide some concrete examples of scenarios that violate these assumptions?

2. The paper presents a new logic called MCL that is sound and complete over "general concurrent game models" that do not make the three assumptions mentioned above. What specifically does giving up each assumption allow these new models to represent that concurrent game models cannot? Give examples. 

3. Explain in detail the differences in semantics between coalition logic (CL) formulas that use the coalition modality and the same formulas interpreted in MCL. How does the meaning of unconditional versus conditional joint action affect the truth conditions?

4. The paper shows completeness of MCL using filtrations and a series of “downward validity” and “upward derivability” lemmas. Can you walk through the key ideas behind one of these lemmas and explain how it is used in the completeness proof?  

5. What motivated the definitions of the two types of “standard formulas” presented in the paper and how do these specifically facilitate the completeness proof?

6. The paper mentions that MCL seems to be a "minimal" coalition logic in the context of strategic reasoning. What exactly does this mean? Why can none of the MCL axioms be easily given up?

7. The related work section mentions that strategy logic and alternating-time temporal logic are extensions of coalition logic that add additional operators. What might some of the advantages be of instead starting with MCL as a base logic and adding temporal or strategy operators?

8. One could imagine trying to give up just one or two of the three assumptions instead of all three. What are some logics “in between” MCL and CL that would be worth investigating further that you might propose?

9. The granularity of actions can affect whether independence of agents or determinism holds. Explain this issue further and discuss whether it limits the applicability of MCL.

10. The paper focuses on semantic issues related to modeling games. How might one start to bridge the gap to considerations of computational complexity for model checking and strategy synthesis algorithms for logics like MCL?
