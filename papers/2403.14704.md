# [A minimal coalition logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14704)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Coalition Logic (CL) is used for strategic reasoning, but its models (concurrent game models) make three assumptions that are too strong: independence of agents, seriality, and determinism. 
- Independence of agents means joint actions of disjoint coalitions can always be merged. But some joint actions are conditional on other agents' simultaneous actions.  
- Seriality means coalitions always have available joint actions. But sometimes there are no actions, like when a game terminates.
- Determinism of the grand coalition's joint actions does not always hold either.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a minimal coalition logic called MCL based on more general concurrent game models that do not assume independence of agents, seriality or determinism. 
- Give semantics and axiom system for completeness of MCL.
- Compare MCL to CL. Formulas and validities differ due to the dropped assumptions.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and argue against three assumptions of CL models: independence of agents, seriality and determinism.  
- Define general concurrent game models without these assumptions.
- Develop a Minimal Coalition Logic (MCL) sound and complete over the more general class of models.
- Show how validities differ between MCL and CL due to differences in models.
- MCL seems to be a minimal logic for strategic reasoning without unnecessarily strong assumptions.

In summary, the paper identifies and relaxes three assumptions of Coalition Logic that are too strong for representing all strategic scenarios. It develops a Minimal Coalition Logic over more general models without those assumptions and shows it is sound and complete.
