# [GLIGEN: Open-Set Grounded Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07093)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main focus of this paper seems to be on developing an approach for adding grounding capabilities to existing pretrained text-to-image diffusion models, in particular enabling them to incorporate additional inputs like bounding boxes, keypoints, maps, etc. beyond just text captions. The key research question seems to be:

How can we expand pretrained text-to-image diffusion models to enable more controllable and grounded image generation using additional input modalities, while still retaining the models' original knowledge and generation quality?

The authors propose an approach called GLIGEN that inserts additional trainable layers to incorporate new grounding inputs into a pretrained model like Stable Diffusion, while freezing the original weights to preserve the models' knowledge. The main hypothesis seems to be that this method can enable these models to generate images that accurately reflect spatial and semantic grounding signals like bounding boxes, without compromising on image quality or text grounding ability. 

The experiments then aim to validate whether GLIGEN can effectively enable open-set grounded generation on new concepts, accurately reflect spatial grounding inputs like bounding boxes even on novel layouts/configurations, and generalize well to unseen datasets. The authors also showcase grounded generation on diverse modalities beyond bounding boxes. Overall, the central focus seems to be researching how to effectively expand pretrained models to incorporate grounding signals for more control, while minimizing negative impacts on quality or generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Gligen (Grounded-Language-to-Image Generation) that endows new grounding capabilities to existing pretrained text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- The paper proposes to inject new conditional inputs like bounding boxes, keypoints, reference images etc. into pretrained diffusion models to provide more control over text-to-image generation. 

- To prevent forgetting the knowledge in the pretrained weights, the original model is frozen and new trainable modules are added that gradually fuse the grounding information into the model using gated self-attention.

- This approach allows open-world grounded text2img generation, where the model can generalize to novel concepts and spatial configurations not seen during training.

- The method is flexible and achieves strong results on various grounding inputs like bounding boxes, keypoints, reference images, edge maps etc.

- It significantly outperforms prior closed-set layout2image baselines on COCO and shows good generalization to unseen concepts on LVIS.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple yet effective approach to acquire controllability over frozen large-scale generative models like Stable Diffusion, while retaining their knowledge and generation quality. This opens up many future possibilities for building upon such foundation models.
