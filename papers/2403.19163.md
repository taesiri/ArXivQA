# [D'OH: Decoder-Only random Hypernetworks for Implicit Neural   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19163)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown promise for compressing various signals like images, video, audio etc into compact neural network models. However, achieving different rates of compression requires searching over different network architectures which is computationally expensive. Also, aggressive quantization of weights leads to rapid decline in reconstruction quality. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel decoder-only hypernetwork (called D'OH) to address these issues. At its core is a low-dimensional latent code that is projected via fixed random matrices to generate the weights of a target INR network. By varying just the latent code dimension, compression rate can be smoothly adjusted without needing neural architecture search. Also, tying all weights to a single latent code makes the model robust to aggressive quantization.

The key ideas are:
1) Avoid encoder-decoder hypernetworks that require offline training on signal class datasets. Instead directly optimize latent code at runtime using just the target signal.
2) Use linear random projections as the decoder. This enables very compact representation requiring only communication of latent code and projection seeds.
3) Initialize projections properly so target INR weights match standard variance initialization schemes. 

Contributions:
1) Introduce the decoder-only hypernetwork concept for runtime optimization of INRs without offline training data.
2) Demonstrate improved rate-distortion performance relative to baselines by smoothly interpolating compression via latent dimension.
3) Avoid expensive neural architecture search for varying compression rates by instead directly modifying latent dimension.
4) Show greater robustness to quantization by tying all weights to a single latent code.
5) Describe a distillation procedure to project pretrained INR into a decoder-only hypernetwork.

In summary, the paper presents decoder-only hypernetworks as an efficient way to compress implicit neural representations without needing external training data or neural architecture search.
