# [Improving Adversarial Transferability of Visual-Language Pre-training   Models through Collaborative Multimodal Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10883)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-language pretraining (VLP) models have shown great performance on various multimodal tasks but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. 
- Existing attacks on VLP models have limited transferability across models and tasks due to overlooking modality interactions during the attacks.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel attack called Collaborative Multimodal Interaction Attack (CMI-Attack) that enhances transferability by fully leveraging modality interactions.

- CMI-Attack has two key components:
    1) Embedding Guidance: Attacks text at embedding level using semantically similar words based on GloVe embeddings rather than attacking directly at the word level. This better preserves semantics and utilizes influence of images on text.
    
    2) Interaction Enhancement: Accumulates image gradients and uses them to enhance constraints on perturbations of both text and images. This mutually enhances attacks on both modalities.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis showing importance of modality interactions for attacking VLP models based on two key observations. 

- Proposal of CMI-Attack that effectively utilizes modality interactions through embedding guidance and interaction enhancement.

- Extensive experiments showing CMI-Attack achieves much higher attack transferability across diverse VLP models and tasks:
    - 8.11%-16.75% higher success rates on Flickr30K image retrieval
    - 7.2% better attack effectiveness on MSCOCO image captioning

- Analysis provides insights into vulnerability of VLP models against adversarial attacks and can motivate more robust model design.
