# [CogAgent: A Visual Language Model for GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08914)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces CogAgent, a visual language model designed for GUI understanding and planning tasks while retaining strong generalist abilities. CogAgent builds on CogVLM and addresses the challenges of training data and high image resolution by pre-training on a new largescale GUI and OCR dataset and introducing a cross-attention branch to trade off resolution and model size. Experiments show that CogAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on GUI understanding benchmarks, surpassing methods using structured text. It also sets new records on 9 general visual QA datasets. The modelâ€™s dual-branch design significantly reduces compute compared to single-branch models. Overall, CogAgent represents an advancement of visual agents that can perceive GUIs with human-level or better understanding, facilitated by advances in visual language modeling. The open-source release aims to promote future research into these highly capable visual agents.
