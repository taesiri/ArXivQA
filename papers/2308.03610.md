# [AvatarVerse: High-quality &amp; Stable 3D Avatar Creation from Text and Pose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03610)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we automatically generate high-quality, diverse, and stable 3D avatars from textual descriptions and pose guidance? The key hypotheses driving this work seem to be:1) Using DensePose as a conditioning signal for a 2D diffusion model can enable precise view consistency and pose control over 3D avatar generation, helping address issues like the Janus problem. 2) A progressive high-resolution generation strategy involving techniques like progressive voxel grids, focus modes, and decreasing camera radius can capture finer avatar details compared to global guidance.3) Surface smoothing of the voxel density grid during optimization can improve the visual quality of avatars by encouraging compact, smooth surfaces.4) The proposed AvatarVerse framework, through the combination of DensePose conditioning, progressive high-resolution guidance, and surface smoothing, can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating detailed, stable 3D avatars from text descriptions.The paper aims to validate these hypotheses through extensive experiments, ablation studies, and user evaluations. The overall goal is to push the boundaries of automatic 3D avatar creation to be more robust, higher-fidelity, and better controlled compared to prior text-to-3D generation techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Presenting AvatarVerse, a novel framework for generating high-quality and stable 3D avatars from just text prompts and poses. 2. Proposing the DensePose-conditioned score distillation sampling loss, which enables pose-aware 3D avatar synthesis and mitigates the Janus (multi-face) problem for more stable generation.3. Introducing a progressive high-resolution generation strategy involving techniques like progressive grid, progressive radius, and focus mode to enhance the fidelity and details of the synthesized avatars.4. Leveraging a smoothness loss to regularize the avatar surface and achieve globally coherent shapes during the voxel grid optimization. 5. Demonstrating through extensive experiments and user studies that AvatarVerse significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in crafting detailed 3D avatars in a stable manner.In summary, the key contribution is developing a fully automatic pipeline called AvatarVerse that can generate high-quality, stable 3D avatars from just text prompts and poses, setting a new standard for controllable avatar creation. The technical novelty lies in the proposed DensePose conditioning, progressive high-resolution generation, and surface smoothing strategies.
