# [MobileVLM V2: Faster and Stronger Baseline for Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision language models (VLMs) have shown great promise in multimodal understanding and reasoning. However, existing VLMs are computationally expensive and not suitable for deployment to edge devices. There is a need for efficient and fast VLMs that can achieve strong performance on par with or better than much larger models. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MobileVLM V2, a family of mobile-friendly VLMs optimized for speed and performance. The key aspects are:

1) Exploiting high-quality pretraining data: Uses 1.2 million diverse image-text pairs from ShareGPT4V dataset to improve image-text alignment.

2) Improved training strategies: Fully trains the projector and language model in both pretraining and multi-task stages to better harness the potential of superior data.  

3) Lightweight downsample projector (LDPv2): Introduces more efficient projector design with token reduction and positional encoding to bridge vision and language models using fewer parameters.

Main Contributions:

1) Achieves new state-of-the-art speed vs performance tradeoff on VLM benchmarks, outperforming models with up to 7x more parameters. 

2) MobileVLM V2 1.7B matches or exceeds much larger 3B models. The 3B version outperforms even 7B+ models on some tasks.

3) Training strategies and model architectural designs proposed allow small models to better exploit high-quality data and align vision-language modalities.

4) Strong performance combined with optimized mobile-friendly design makes the models suitable for deployment to edge devices, opening up more VLM applications.

In summary, through careful data curation, training methodology and model design optimizations, the paper pushes the frontier of small yet powerful VLMs for real-world usage. The open-sourced models and strategies can enable further research and applications with efficient on-device VLMs.
