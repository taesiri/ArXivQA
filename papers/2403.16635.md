# [V2X-PC: Vehicle-to-everything Collaborative Perception via Point Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16635)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) collaborative perception task, which aims to enhance the perception capability of individual vehicles by allowing them to exchange complementary information with surrounding traffic agents like other vehicles and roadside infrastructure. However, existing methods adopting bird's eye view (BEV) maps as the basic message unit suffer from three issues:

1) Object feature destruction during message packing due to channel compression or spatial selection to meet bandwidth constraints. This leads to loss of high-level semantic information. 

2) Inefficient message aggregation for long-range collaboration as the complexity grows quadratically with range expansion and unnecessary zero-padding is required to aggregate BEV maps.

3) Implicit structure representation communication since voxelization sacrifices geometric details compared to raw point clouds, limiting the precision of predicted box boundaries.

Proposed Solution:

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new collaborative message unit called "point cluster", which consists of:

1) Point coordinates representing object structure
2) A cluster center representing object position  
3) A cluster feature representing object semantics

Based on this, a collaborative perception framework V2X-PC is introduced. Key components include:

1) A Point Cluster Packing (PCP) module that reduces bandwidth usage by decreasing the number of points per cluster, avoiding high-level semantic information loss.

2) A Point Cluster Aggregation (PCA) module that matches and merges point clusters from different agents belonging to the same object into a complete representation. This avoids zero-padding and exhibits complexity only related to object number rather than range.

3) Solutions to handle pose error and time latency that align clusters across spatial and temporal dimensions in a parameter-free manner, enhancing robustness.


Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of point cluster as a new collaborative message unit that preserves object information during packing, enables efficient long-range aggregation, and supports explicit structure communication.

2) A complete V2X collaborative perception framework V2X-PC built on point clusters, encompassing the PCP and PCA modules.

3) Parameter-free solutions that adapt to different noise levels without finetuning to address robustness issues like pose error and time latency.

4) Superior performance over previous BEV-based methods on two datasets, especially under strict IOU thresholds, limited bandwidth and noisy settings. Fine-grained analysis also demonstrates enhanced collaboration capability.
