## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Facial emotion recognition is an important task with applications in areas like business, security, and human-computer interaction. However, designing an accurate facial recognition system comes with challenges. The paper explores using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address these challenges and accurately recognize facial expressions. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a CNN model for facial emotion recognition. The model has 3 convolution layers with batch normalization, max pooling, dropout, and ReLU activation functions. This is followed by a fully connected layer with 256 neurons and a softmax output layer for classification. The model is trained on the FER2013 dataset. Hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, epochs and optimizers are tuned to improve accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Implements and evaluates a CNN architecture for facial emotion recognition on the FER2013 dataset
- Tunes hyperparameters like epochs, batch size, learning rate and optimizers to improve model accuracy
- Achieves highest validation accuracy of 60.20% with 200 epochs using the SGD optimizer, outperforming the Adam optimizer
- Provides analysis of how different parameter settings impact model accuracy and loss
- Demonstrates feasibility of using CNNs for facial emotion recognition, sets baseline for future work on tuning the model and testing on other datasets

In summary, the paper explores using CNNs for facial emotion recognition, proposes a specific model architecture, tunes hyperparameters to improve accuracy, and analyzes performance across different parameter settings. It demonstrates the promise of CNNs for this task while highlighting areas for future work to further advance accuracy.
