# [$\texttt{Se}^2$: $\textit{Se}$quential Example $\textit{Se}$lection for   In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- In-context learning (ICL) for large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on appropriate demonstration examples to activate the model's capabilities. However, prior work on example selection predominantly follows a "select then organize" approach which neglects relationships between examples.

Proposed Solution  
- The paper proposes Se2, a novel method that formulates example selection as a sequential problem. Se2 utilizes an LLM's feedback on varying context to capture inter-relationships and sequential information between examples. 

- Se2 employs a sequential-aware model trained on LLM scoring data constructed across different context inputs. Beam search is used during inference to enhance sequence quality and diversity.

Main Contributions
- Proposes a new sequential paradigm for selecting demo examples that models relationships between them.

- Introduces Se2, a sequence-aware method that leverages LLM feedback on changing context to discern example relationships.

- Achieves significant gains over baselines on 23 NLP datasets, highlighting efficacy of modeling sequence information for ideal prompt construction.

- Analysis shows Se2's stability across tasks/models, ability to identify logically related examples, and transferability by scoring with smaller LLM.

In summary, the key innovation is formulating example selection as a sequential problem and using sequential signals from an LLM to discern relationships between examples. This facilitates superior prompt construction and downstream task performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Se2 for selecting optimal sequences of examples to include in prompts to improve in-context learning performance of large language models, using encoder models to score candidate examples and beam search to construct high-quality example sequences that capture relationships between examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It proposes a novel sequential example selection paradigm for in-context learning (ICL), departing from the traditional "select then organize" approach. 

2) It introduces Se2, a sequence-aware method that can select an ideal sequence of examples as an in-context prompt by modeling the conditional probability of the example sequence given the current context.

3) Se2 employs a sequential training process using a language model's feedback on varying context inputs and candidate examples. This allows it to capture interrelationships and sequential information.

4) During inference, Se2 uses beam search to construct high-quality and diverse example sequences.

5) Through extensive experiments on 23 NLP tasks, Se2 shows significant performance improvements over competitive baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling sequence information and example relationships for ICL.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new sequential approach to example selection that outperforms prior methods by leveraging sequence modeling and relationships between examples.
