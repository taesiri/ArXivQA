# [Can GPT Improve the State of Prior Authorization via Guideline Based   Automated Question Answering?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Health insurance companies have a time-consuming process called prior authorization (PA) where doctors must get pre-approval for procedures. Validating if requests meet criteria like patient age or condition is challenging. 

- Clinicians must search lengthy patient records to assess if criteria were met. This is burdensome when records can be 20-400 pages.

- There is a need to alleviate this manual search through records to match criteria, which would improve clinician workflow.

Solution:
- The paper examines whether the GPT language model can extract information from patient records and answer questions based on clinical guidelines frequently used for PA decisions. 

- Spine imaging guidelines are used as a test case since they are commonly requested and have multiple criteria to evaluate. 

- The problem is framed as a question answering task - prompting GPT to answer questions about criteria from patient records. 

Methods:
- Experiments compare conventional prompting approaches for GPT as well as a new proposed method called Implicit Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

- Implicit RAG first retrieves relevant segments of the patient record before reasoning over them to answer questions.

Results: 
- The Implicit RAG approach achieves the best performance with a mean weighted F1 score of 0.61, outperforming other methods.

- Human expert assessment finds agreement with Implicit RAG's outputs in most cases, demonstrating usefulness.

Contributions:
- Proposes a new prompting technique called Implicit RAG that improves performance for GPT question answering from patient records.

- Demonstrates feasibility of using GPT to validate criteria from guidelines, helping to alleviate clinician manual review and speed up prior authorization decisions.
