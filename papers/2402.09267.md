# [Self-Alignment for Factuality: Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs via   Self-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Self-Alignment for Factuality: Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs via Self-Evaluation":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) sometimes generate plausible but factually incorrect statements (hallucinations), even when they possess relevant knowledge. This undermines their reliability for real-world use.
- A key issue is the gap between the LLM "knowing" vs "telling" factual information. LLMs may fail to convey accurate information despite having the knowledge.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a self-alignment framework called "Self-Alignment for Factuality" (SAF) to mitigate factual hallucinations in LLMs by utilizing their self-evaluation capability.
- A factuality self-evaluation module (Self-Eval) is designed to prompt the LLM to validate the factuality of its own responses based solely on its internal knowledge. 
- To improve the LLM's confidence estimation and calibration for self-evaluation, a Self-Knowledge Tuning (SKT) method is proposed.
- The factuality scores from Self-Eval are used as reward signals to fine-tune the LLM via Direct Preference Optimization towards enhanced factuality.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes SAF, a self-alignment strategy to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs using their self-evaluation ability without external knowledge.
- Introduces SKT to improve LLM's confidence estimation and calibration, boosting its self-evaluation capability.  
- Shows SAF significantly enhances factual accuracy of Llama models across MCQA, short-form text generation, and long-form text generation tasks on TruthfulQA and BioGEN datasets.
- Outperforms existing decoding-based and consistency-based methods for hallucination mitigation.

In summary, the key novelty is guiding LLMs towards factuality by utilizing their intrinsic capability to self-evaluate the factual correctness of their responses. The proposed SAF framework demonstrates strong empirical performance in mitigating hallucinations across diverse knowledge-intensive tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a self-alignment framework called "Self-Alignment for Factuality" that leverages a language model's ability to self-evaluate the factuality of its generated responses to provide training signals to fine-tune the model to mitigate factual inaccuracies (hallucinations).


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a self-alignment framework called "Self-Alignment for Factuality" (SAF) that leverages a language model's ability to self-evaluate the factuality of its own generated responses. Specifically:

1) The paper introduces a factuality self-evaluation component called "Self-Eval" that prompts the language model to validate the factuality of its generated responses based solely on its internal knowledge. 

2) The paper also proposes "Self-Knowledge Tuning" (SKT) to improve the language model's confidence estimation and calibration for factuality evaluation.

3) The self-evaluated responses are then used to construct preference training data to fine-tune the language model using the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. This steers the model towards enhanced factuality.

In experiments, SAF showed substantial gains in factual accuracy over baseline models on question answering, short text generation, and long text generation tasks, without needing any external knowledge or human annotations. The key insight is to leverage the model's own self-evaluation capability to provide supervision for improving factuality.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Self-alignment - The main proposed framework that leverages an LLM's self-evaluation ability to mitigate hallucinations.

- Factuality self-evaluation (\self{}) - A component that prompts the LLM to validate the factuality of its own generated responses based solely on its internal knowledge. 

- Self-knowledge tuning (\skt{}) - A method to improve the LLM's confidence estimation and calibration to enhance its self-evaluation capabilities.

- Direct preference optimization (DPO) - The algorithm used to fine-tune the LLM on the self-annotated preference data towards improved factuality.

- Hallucinations - Factually incorrect statements generated by LLMs, which is the key phenomenon being addressed.

- TruthfulQA - One of the main datasets used to evaluate performance on multiple-choice QA, short-form text generation, and factuality metrics.  

- BioGEN - Key dataset for evaluating long-form text generation and factuality.

- FActScore - Automatic evaluation metric used to assess factual accuracy on the BioGEN dataset.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed methods like self-alignment, components like the factuality self-evaluator, algorithms like DPO, the problem being tackled - hallucinations, and the main datasets and metrics used for evaluation.
