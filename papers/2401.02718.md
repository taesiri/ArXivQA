# [Calibration Attack: A Framework For Adversarial Attacks Targeting   Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard adversarial attacks only focus on incorrect predictions but confidence scores, and hence model calibration, remain untouched. This leaves models vulnerable to attacks that induce miscalibration while maintaining accuracy.

Solution: 
- Propose 4 types of "calibration attacks" to deliberately miscalibrate models without changing predictions:
   1) Underconfidence attack - reduce confidence scores
   2) Overconfidence attack - increase confidence scores  
   3) Maximum miscalibration attack - maximize miscalibration 
   4) Random confidence attack - randomize confidence scores

- Implement attacks using Square Attack framework (black box) and projected gradient descent (white box) 

- Propose two defenses tailored to mitigate calibration attacks:
   1) Calibration Attack Adversarial Training (CAAT) 
   2) Compression Scaling (CS) 

Contributions:

- Introduce concept of calibration attacks - a new class of threats for ML models

- Demonstrate effectiveness of 4 calibration attacks on ResNet and Vision Transformer models across 3 datasets

- Analyze impact of attack hyperparameters (epsilon, iterations) and properties (under vs overconfidence)

- Show that calibration attacks can bypass common adversarial detection methods 

- Evaluate defenses like adversarial training and calibration methods against calibration attacks

- Propose two new defenses (CAAT and CS) that help mitigate calibration attacks more effectively

Overall, the paper highlights serious vulnerabilities in model calibration and provides frameworks to generate and defend against calibration attacks, opening up an important new area of research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces and investigates four types of calibration attacks (underconfidence, overconfidence, maximum miscalibration, and random confidence) that aim to trap deep learning models into being miscalibrated without affecting their accuracy, posing serious threats to model reliability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing and investigating a new form of adversarial attack called "calibration attack", which focuses on attacking the calibration of machine learning models by deceiving them to be over- or under-confident without modifying their prediction accuracy. 

2) Proposing and testing four specific types of calibration attacks: underconfidence attack, overconfidence attack, maximum miscalibration attack, and random confidence attack. The attacks are evaluated primarily in a black-box threat model on image classification tasks.

3) Showing the effectiveness of the proposed calibration attacks on typical deep learning models, demonstrating that they can cause significant miscalibration even with a relatively small number of queries.

4) Analyzing different aspects of calibration attacks, including the impact of attack hyperparameters, comparison to standard attacks, and detection difficulty.

5) Investigating the robustness of common adversarial defenses and calibration methods against these calibration attacks, revealing limitations that need to be addressed.

6) Devising two novel defense methods tailored to defending against calibration attacks: Calibration Attack Adversarial Training (CAAT) and Compression Scaling (CS).

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and comprehensively studying this new threat of calibration attacks, evaluating their effectiveness, analyzing their properties, testing existing defenses against them, and proposing initial defense strategies.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Calibration attack - The main concept introduced, a type of adversarial attack that targets model calibration rather than accuracy.

- Miscalibration - A key measure of performance, referring to the mismatch between a model's confidence scores and actual performance.

- Underconfidence attack - One of the four proposed calibration attacks, aimed at reducing model confidence. 

- Overconfidence attack - Another proposed attack, with the goal of increasing confidence scores.

- Maximum miscalibration attack - Aims to induce the highest possible miscalibration.

- Random confidence attack - Randomizes the confidence scores. 

- Expected Calibration Error (ECE) - A common metric used to quantify miscalibration.

- Kolmogorov-Smirnov Calibration Error - An alternative non-binning calibration metric.

- Query efficiency - Used to measure the efficiency of attacks in terms of number of queries.

- Adversarial training - A defense method based on including adversarial examples during training.

So in summary, the key terms cover the different types of attacks, metrics, defenses, and measures of performance relevant to studying these calibration attacks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new framework called "calibration attacks" that aim to trap models into being miscalibrated without changing their accuracy. Could you expand more on why this could be dangerous or problematic in real-world applications compared to regular accuracy-targeted attacks?

2. The paper introduces 4 types of calibration attacks: underconfidence, overconfidence, maximum miscalibration, and random confidence attacks. Can you explain the key difference between each one and why the maximum miscalibration attack tends to be the most effective? 

3. The paper tests these attacks under both white-box and black-box threat models. What are the key differences in how these attacks are implemented under each threat model? Which one poses a more realistic threat and why?

4. The paper proposes two novel defense methods against calibration attacks called CAAT and Compression Scaling. Can you explain how each method works to defend against calibration attacks? What are their relative strengths and weaknesses? 

5. The paper shows calibration attacks are much harder to detect using common adversarial detection methods compared to normal attacks. Why do you think this is the case? How could detection methods be improved to better handle calibration attacks?

6. The paper finds that model calibration and robustness are often at odds - well calibrated models before attacks become more miscalibrated after. However, some defenses compromise heavily on accuracy. How can this tradeoff between accuracy, robustness and calibration be better managed?

7. The paper shows the effectiveness of calibration attacks under different model architectures, datasets and norms. What factors tend to make models more robust or vulnerable to these attacks and why?

8. The overconfidence attacks in the paper actually don't increase miscalibration by much since accuracy is high. However, the paper warns they could still be highly dangerous by making confidence scores meaningless. Can you expand on how this could seriously affect real-world usage?

9. The paper finds calibration attacks to be very efficient, often requiring far fewer queries than a normal attack to cause miscalibration. What properties allow them to succeed with fewer queries compared to normal attacks?

10. The paper explores how factors like imbalanced training data affects robustness against calibration attacks. How significant is this effect and how could issues like class imbalance be better handled to improve robustness?
