# [s2s-ft: Fine-Tuning Pretrained Transformer Encoders for   Sequence-to-Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13640)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can pretrained bidirectional Transformers like BERT be effectively fine-tuned for sequence-to-sequence natural language generation tasks?The key hypothesis is that by using appropriate self-attention masks and fine-tuning approaches adapted from UniLM, the capabilities of powerful pretrained bidirectional models like BERT, RoBERTa, and UniLMv2 can be leveraged to achieve strong performance on conditional text generation tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes and compares three fine-tuning methods:1) Causal fine-tuning: Generates target text autoregressively using a causal self-attention mask, similar to a causal LM.2) Masked fine-tuning: Randomly masks some target tokens and predicts them based on context, similar to masked LM pretraining. 3) Pseudo-masked fine-tuning: Adds pseudo mask tokens for target words to enable a compromise between the above two approaches.The central hypothesis is that pseudo-masked fine-tuning will perform best by avoiding position shift discrepancies while enabling full backpropagation, which is evaluated empirically on summarization and question generation tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my analysis, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a new sequence-to-sequence fine-tuning toolkit called s2s-ft. It focuses on fine-tuning pretrained bidirectional Transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA and UniLM for conditional text generation tasks. - Most prior work has focused on unidirectional pretrained models like GPT-2 for text generation. There has been some work on using BERT-like pretrained models as encoders paired with randomly initialized decoders, but performance lags models like BART and T5 that are jointly pretrained.- This paper shows that by using techniques like causal language modeling, masked LM, and pseudo-masked LM, the s2s-ft toolkit can achieve strong performance competitive with BART and T5. For example, on XSum summarization, s2s-ft outperforms MASS, BERTSumAbs, and achieves similar ROUGE scores as PEGASUS.- A key novelty is directly fine-tuning bidirectional pretrained models for text generation through clever use of self-attention masks, rather than needing a separate decoder. This provides a simple and unified approach to leverage existing pretrained bidirectional Transformers.- Compared to concurrent work like UniLM, this paper focuses on conditional text generation tasks like summarization and question generation, rather than unconditional LM pretraining. The techniques and results on downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of s2s-ft.- The paper also shows s2s-ft works for multilingual generation by using XLM-RoBERTa, outperforming prior multilingual models like XNLG and XLM. This expands the applicability of leveraging pretrained bidirectional Transformers.In summary, s2s-ft provides a simple and effective toolkit for sequence-to-sequence generation by fine-tuning bidirectional Transformer models, advancing the capability of using them for conditional text generation across multiple languages. The techniques and strong empirical results advance the state-of-the-art in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest include:- Evaluating the performance of the s2s-ft toolkit on a broader range of sequence-to-sequence tasks beyond abstractive summarization and question generation. The authors mention machine translation, dialogue, and other text generation applications as promising avenues.- Applying the toolkit to even more languages by leveraging other multilingual pretrained models. The paper presents results on Chinese and French using XLM-RoBERTa, but the authors suggest exploring other languages.- Comparing additional pretrained bidirectional Transformer models as initialization checkpoints for fine-tuning. The authors experiment with BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and UniLM, but suggest trying others like XLNet or T5.- Exploring different fine-tuning strategies like adapter modules to efficiently adapt the pretrained models. The methods in the paper directly fine-tune all parameters, but more parameter-efficient approaches could be beneficial.- Leveraging reinforcement learning, data augmentation, or retrieval techniques to further boost performance on generation tasks when using the toolkit. The authors focus on supervised learning but suggest exploring those extensions.- Applying the methods to long text generation tasks like storytelling where maintaining coherence is challenging. The current tasks are limited in output length.In summary, the main directions are evaluating on more tasks and languages, comparing more pretrained models, trying more efficient fine-tuning approaches, incorporating more advanced training techniques, and tackling longer text generation problems. The flexibility of the toolkit provides many opportunities for future work.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:The paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence fine-tuning toolkit called \stosft{} for conditional natural language generation tasks. \stosft{} leverages pretrained bidirectional Transformer models like BERT by employing specialized self-attention masks to adapt them for sequence-to-sequence learning.
