# [Enhancing Ethical Explanations of Large Language Models through   Iterative Symbolic Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 still suffer from issues like factual errors, inference inconsistencies, and limited interpretability in their reasoning, especially for complex domains like ethical reasoning. 
- There is a need for techniques to enhance the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations produced by LLMs to underlying moral principles.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Logic-Explainer, a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with an external backward-chaining solver to refine and verify step-wise natural language explanations for ethical reasoning.
- It adopts an iterative symbolic refinement strategy to improve the correctness, completeness and non-redundancy of LLM-generated explanations.  
- At each iteration, the framework autoformalizes the explanation to logical rules, validates it using the solver, then performs abductive inference to add missing facts and deductive inference to revise the hypothesis if needed.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a novel neuro-symbolic framework for iterative refinement and verification of LLM-generated explanations for ethical reasoning.
- Extensive experiments showing Logic-Explainer can significantly improve logical validity, completeness and non-redundancy of explanations over baseline LLM methods.
- Release of a corpus of structured explanations for ethical reasoning (ExplainEthics) to support future research.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the promise of integrating neural and symbolic techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretability of reasoning in LLMs for complex ethical domains. The iterative refinement strategy is shown to be effective at iteratively improving explanation quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic framework called Logic-Explainer that integrates large language models with a backward-chaining solver to iteratively refine and verify the logical validity, completeness, and non-redundancy of natural language explanations for ethical reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The introduction of a neuro-symbolic framework for multi-step ethical reasoning and explanation generation that integrates Large Language Models with backward-chaining reasoning for iterative symbolic refinement.

2. An extensive set of experiments on multi-step NLI tasks in the ethical domain to investigate the effectiveness of such integration on LLMs' explanations. 

3. The release of a corpus of structured natural language explanations for ethical NLI (ExplainEthics) to augment existing datasets and encourage future work in the field.

In summary, the paper proposes a way to improve the logical validity, completeness, and non-redundancy of explanations generated by Large Language Models for ethical natural language inference. It does this by iteratively refining the explanations using a neuro-symbolic framework that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with the logical reasoning of a backward-chaining solver. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through experiments, and a new dataset is contributed to encourage further research.

The paper focuses on enhancing the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations produced by Large Language Models through a neuro-symbolic framework called Logic-Explainer. This framework integrates LLMs with a backward-chaining solver to iteratively refine explanations via abductive and deductive inference. The goal is to improve the correctness, completeness, and non-redundancy of explanations on ethical NLI tasks requiring commonsense reasoning. The released corpus "ExplainEthics" is also a key output. The integration of neural and symbolic methods is a core theme.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative refinement strategy to improve the logical validity and completeness of explanations generated by large language models. Can you elaborate on why existing methods like in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought fail to produce logically coherent explanations? What are the key limitations?

2. The core of the proposed Logic-Explainer framework is the integration of large language models with backward-chaining solvers. Can you walk through the workflow and specifically explain the role of abductive and deductive reasoning in iteratively refining the explanations? 

3. The paper evaluates the framework on ethical natural language inference tasks. Why is ethical NLI an interesting testbed? What types of reasoning capabilities does it require from AI systems?

4. One of the key ideas is to leverage semantic role labeling to construct structured prompts that elicit better interpretations of actions and participant roles from LLMs. Can you discuss the details of this semantic prompting strategy? What is the intuition behind it?

5. The paper uses autoformalization to translate natural language explanations into a formal representation in Prolog. What is the motivation behind this? How does the symbolic solver exploit the formalized knowledge?

6. One of the metrics used to evaluate explanation quality is logical validity. Can you clearly define what constitutes a logically valid or invalid explanation? What are the different categories used for classification?

7. For invalid explanations, the errors are further classified into "missing plausible premises" and "no discernible argument". What is the difference between these two categories and how are they identified?

8. The paper finds that logical validity plateaus after 2-3 refinement iterations. What factors contribute to this behaviour? Is there a way this limitation can be addressed?

9. The released ExplainEthics corpus contains verified explanations aligned with underlying moral principles. What is the envisioned value of this resource? How can the community build on it?

10. The conclusion discusses limitations around evaluating nuanced ethical perspectives. What enhancements would you suggest to expand the scope and rubric of evaluation to address ethical and cultural relativism?
