# [Visually Guided Self Supervised Learning of Speech Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04316)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn useful speech representations in a self-supervised manner using visual supervision. Specifically, the authors propose a framework for learning audio representations guided by the visual modality in the context of audiovisual speech. The key hypothesis is that by generating video of speech from audio, the audio encoder network will be driven to learn speech representations that capture information relevant for producing realistic facial movements and lip synchronization. These visually-guided speech representations can then be evaluated on downstream speech tasks like emotion recognition and speech recognition without requiring any manual annotation.

In summary, the main research question is: Can visual supervision be exploited to learn good self-supervised speech representations? The key hypothesis is that an audio encoder trained to generate video of speech will capture useful speech information like emotions and phonemes needed to produce proper facial expressions and lip movements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework for learning audio representations guided by the visual modality in the context of audiovisual speech. Specifically:

- They employ a generative audio-to-video training scheme where they animate a still image corresponding to a given audio clip and optimize the generated video to match the real video. 

- Through this process, the audio encoder network learns useful speech representations that they evaluate on emotion recognition and speech recognition tasks. 

- They achieve state-of-the-art results for emotion recognition and competitive results for speech recognition using their self-supervised audio features.

- This demonstrates the potential of using visual supervision, i.e. generating facial expressions and lip movements from audio, as a way to learn useful audio representations in a self-supervised manner. 

In summary, the key contribution is showing that visual modality can guide the learning of audio representations for speech in a cross-modal self-supervised approach, which has not been explored before. The results show this is a promising direction for unsupervised speech representation learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a framework for learning speech representations in an unsupervised manner by using visual information from faces as supervision. Specifically, it generates videos of facial movements from audio and optimizes the generated video to match real videos, which helps the audio encoder learn useful speech features that can be applied to emotion recognition and speech recognition tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key things I noticed about how this paper compares to other research in self-supervised speech representation learning:

- The main novelty of this paper is using visual information from facial movements during speech to guide the learning of audio representations. Most prior self-supervised speech work focuses just on the audio modality alone. Using cross-modal supervision from vision is a new approach.

- For emotion recognition, this method achieves state-of-the-art results on CREMA-D and Ravdess datasets, outperforming other audio-only self-supervised methods like CPC, APC, and PASE. This demonstrates the benefits of the visual guidance.

- For speech recognition, the results are competitive but not state-of-the-art compared to other self-supervised methods like PASE. This suggests there is room for improvement in learning speech representations tailored for ASR.

- The generative framework of animating faces conditioned on audio is similar to other cross-modal generation works, but the application to self-supervised representation learning is novel.

- The approach can leverage large amounts of unlabeled audiovisual speech data, which is a strength over supervised methods reliant on labeled data.

- The features learned could likely be further improved by using even larger and more diverse datasets for pretraining, as the results generalized decently from different pretrain/test splits.

In summary, the key novel contribution is using visual supervision from facial movements to guide audio representation learning in a generative framework. This shows promising results on emotion recognition but is currently still behind state of the art methods for speech recognition. The approach opens up an interesting new direction for exploiting cross-modal self-supervision.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluate the model on naturalistic and continuous affect recognition datasets, rather than just the acted and discrete emotion datasets used in this work. The authors state they would like to test the model on more realistic emotion data in the future.

- Investigate if video features from a model trained on predicting audio from silent video encode complementary information to the audio-only features proposed in this work. The authors suggest exploring using both modalities in the future. 

- Integrate the proposed visually-guided supervision approach into other self-supervised methods. The authors state the visual supervision proposed could easily be incorporated into other self-supervised frameworks.

- Use exponentially larger unlabeled datasets for self-supervised pretraining. The authors' method seems robust to different pretraining sets and they suggest it could benefit from larger amounts of unlabeled data.

- Explore other potential applications of the learned representations beyond emotion recognition and speech recognition. The authors state their visually-guided features have many other promising potential uses.

In summary, the main future directions highlighted are: evaluating on more naturalistic emotion data, combining both audio and video modalities, integrating the approach into other self-supervised methods, using larger datasets, and exploring additional applications of the learned features. The authors emphasize the potential of cross-modal visually-guided supervision as a fruitful area for future work.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for learning useful speech representations in a self-supervised manner by leveraging visual supervision. The method involves training a model to animate a still face image based on a corresponding audio clip, with the goal of generating a realistic synthetic video of the speech.

Overall, the work highlights the potential for using vision to supervise audio representation learning in a novel way not explored in prior self-supervised learning research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for learning speech representations in an unsupervised manner using visual information as guidance. The key idea is to train a model to generate a video of a talking face from a still image and corresponding audio clip. The model has three components - an audio encoder, an image encoder, and a video decoder. By training the model to reconstruct the facial movements and lip sync in the real video, the audio encoder is forced to learn useful speech representations that capture information about phonemes and emotion. 

The method is evaluated on emotion recognition and speech recognition tasks. For emotion recognition, features from the audio encoder are fed to an LSTM classifier. The proposed method outperforms other unsupervised methods like CPC, APC, and PASE on the CREMA-D and Ravdess datasets. For speech recognition using ESPNet, it achieves competitive word error rates on GRID and accuracy on SPC compared to other unsupervised methods, though still below a supervised MFCC baseline. The results demonstrate the potential of using visual information to guide unsupervised speech representation learning, which has not been explored before. The features could be pretrained on large unlabeled audiovisual data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised framework for learning audio representations guided by the visual modality in the context of audiovisual speech. The method uses a generative audio-to-video model that animates a still image of a face based on a speech audio clip. The model is trained to generate a video that matches the real video corresponding to the speech audio. Through this process of trying to accurately animate the face video using the audio, the audio encoder part of the model learns useful speech representations that capture information about facial and lip movements correlated with emotions and phonemes. After pre-training in this self-supervised manner, the audio encoder can be used to extract features from speech that are then evaluated on downstream tasks like emotion recognition and automatic speech recognition without needing any manually annotated labels.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of learning useful speech representations in a self-supervised manner, without requiring manual annotations. Specifically, it is exploring using visual information from facial expressions and lip movements to guide the learning of audio representations. 

The key questions the paper is investigating are:

- Can visual supervision from facial animations be used to learn good speech representations in a self-supervised way? 

- How do the learned audio features compare to other self-supervised methods on tasks like emotion recognition and speech recognition?

- Is there benefit in using cross-modal supervision between audio and video for self-supervised representation learning?

The main idea is to use a generative model that takes an audio clip and still face image as input, and generates a facial animation video. By training this model to generate realistic videos, the audio encoder part learns features that capture information relevant for facial expressions and lip movements. These features can then be evaluated on downstream audio-only tasks.

So in summary, the paper introduces and evaluates visual supervision for self-supervised speech representation learning, which has not been explored much before. The key novelty is using the inherent correlation between audio and visual modalities for faces to learn useful audio features without needing any manual labels.
