# [OlaGPT: Empowering LLMs With Human-like Problem-Solving Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16334)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can large language models (LLMs) be augmented with human-like problem solving abilities to better handle complex reasoning tasks?In particular, the paper proposes a framework called OlaGPT that aims to enhance LLMs by incorporating aspects of human cognition such as attention, memory, learning, reasoning, action selection, and decision making. The key hypotheses are:1. By aligning the reasoning process of LLMs with human cognitive frameworks, their performance on complex reasoning problems can be significantly improved. 2. Modules that approximate different facets of human cognition (e.g. active learning, memory, reasoning templates) can address key limitations of LLMs when solving intricate tasks.3. Drawing inspiration from how humans leverage past experiences, especially mistakes, an active learning mechanism based on 'notes' can enable LLMs to learn from errors.4. Providing LLMs with diverse reasoning templates tailored to different problems, along with a voting mechanism to choose the best approach, can enhance accuracy and robustness.The central goal is to develop a human-like intelligent agent framework that augments LLMs to better comprehend complex intentions, utilize knowledge and tools, learn actively, and reason flexibly - ultimately enabling more human-like problem solving. The paper presents OlaGPT as an implementation of this idea and evaluates it extensively on reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel framework called OlaGPT that enhances large language models (LLMs) with human-like problem-solving abilities. Specifically, OlaGPT approximates key aspects of human cognition including attention, memory, reasoning, learning, and decision-making. 2. The paper designs multiple reasoning templates based on common human thinking frameworks such as lateral thinking, sequential thinking, critical thinking, and integrative thinking. This allows the model to leverage different templates suitable for different types of questions.3. An active learning mechanism is introduced through a "notes library" which records challenging cases and expert explanations to enable the model to learn from past mistakes. The model can refer to relevant notes when encountering similar problems.4. A comprehensive decision-making mechanism with voting strategies is proposed to maximize model accuracy by consolidating the results of diverse reasoning templates.5. Extensive experiments conducted on mathematical and analogical reasoning datasets demonstrate that OlaGPT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, highlighting the efficacy of the overall human-inspired framework.In summary, the key contribution is a novel approach to empower LLMs with enhanced human-like problem-solving abilities by mimicking aspects of human cognition, reasoning, and learning. The proposed OlaGPT framework shows superior performance on complex reasoning tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here is how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper presents a novel framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with human-like problem-solving abilities. This aligns with an emerging focus in AI research on developing more human-centric capabilities. However, most current approaches concentrate narrowly on chains of thought and tool use. In contrast, this work attempts a more comprehensive integration of cognitive frameworks.- The paper highlights challenges faced in systematically imitating modules in human cognition and scheduling them in a practical manner. Other research has not delved as deeply into aligning human and AI reasoning processes. The proposed framework approximates aspects of cognition like attention, memory, reasoning, learning, and decision-making.- The paper introduces an innovative learning method for LLMs to evolve based on historical mistakes and expert solutions. This active learning approach is unique compared to common few-shot learning or retraining strategies. It is more incremental, flexible, and akin to human learning.- The paper designs customizable reasoning templates based on human thinking types like analogical, sequential, critical, and integrative. Most research relies on a fixed reasoning approach. Allowing flexible combinations caters to diverse problems better.- Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing augmented LLM methods. The ablation studies validate the efficacy of key modules like active learning, reasoning templates, and voting strategies. This level of thorough evaluation and analysis is lacking in prior works.In summary, this paper presents a novel and comprehensive human-cognition inspired framework to enhance LLMs. The integration of active learning, customizable reasoning templates, and voting surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches. The in-depth experiments and ablation studies also set it apart from other research. The proposed methods demonstrate promise for developing more human-like AI capabilities.
