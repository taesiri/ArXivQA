# [OlaGPT: Empowering LLMs With Human-like Problem-Solving Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16334)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can large language models (LLMs) be augmented with human-like problem solving abilities to better handle complex reasoning tasks?

In particular, the paper proposes a framework called OlaGPT that aims to enhance LLMs by incorporating aspects of human cognition such as attention, memory, learning, reasoning, action selection, and decision making. The key hypotheses are:

1. By aligning the reasoning process of LLMs with human cognitive frameworks, their performance on complex reasoning problems can be significantly improved. 

2. Modules that approximate different facets of human cognition (e.g. active learning, memory, reasoning templates) can address key limitations of LLMs when solving intricate tasks.

3. Drawing inspiration from how humans leverage past experiences, especially mistakes, an active learning mechanism based on 'notes' can enable LLMs to learn from errors.

4. Providing LLMs with diverse reasoning templates tailored to different problems, along with a voting mechanism to choose the best approach, can enhance accuracy and robustness.

The central goal is to develop a human-like intelligent agent framework that augments LLMs to better comprehend complex intentions, utilize knowledge and tools, learn actively, and reason flexibly - ultimately enabling more human-like problem solving. The paper presents OlaGPT as an implementation of this idea and evaluates it extensively on reasoning tasks.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is trying to address is the limited reasoning and problem-solving abilities of current large language models (LLMs) compared to human cognition. 

The paper points out that while LLMs have shown impressive fluency in generating natural language, they still lack the more complex reasoning skills that humans employ to understand contexts and solve intricate problems. Humans draw on various cognitive capabilities and interact with the environment, tools, and feedback to tackle challenges. 

To bridge this gap, the paper proposes a framework called OlaGPT that incorporates aspects of human cognition into LLMs. The main modules in OlaGPT include:

- Intention Enhancement - to better interpret user queries
- Memory - to store facts, tools, notes (past mistakes)  
- Active Learning - to learn from previous errors 
- Reasoning - to apply different reasoning templates like decomposition
- Controller - to select relevant knowledge/tools
- Voting - to ensemble results from different reasoning paths

By approximating this cognitive architecture and human problem-solving pipeline, the goal is to endow LLMs like GPT-3 with more human-like reasoning abilities to solve complex problems. Experiments on inference tasks demonstrate OlaGPT's superior performance over existing augmented LLMs.

In summary, the key problem is enhancing LLMs' reasoning skills by incorporating elements of human cognition, which OlaGPT aims to achieve through its modular design.
