# [OlaGPT: Empowering LLMs With Human-like Problem-Solving Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16334)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can large language models (LLMs) be augmented with human-like problem solving abilities to better handle complex reasoning tasks?In particular, the paper proposes a framework called OlaGPT that aims to enhance LLMs by incorporating aspects of human cognition such as attention, memory, learning, reasoning, action selection, and decision making. The key hypotheses are:1. By aligning the reasoning process of LLMs with human cognitive frameworks, their performance on complex reasoning problems can be significantly improved. 2. Modules that approximate different facets of human cognition (e.g. active learning, memory, reasoning templates) can address key limitations of LLMs when solving intricate tasks.3. Drawing inspiration from how humans leverage past experiences, especially mistakes, an active learning mechanism based on 'notes' can enable LLMs to learn from errors.4. Providing LLMs with diverse reasoning templates tailored to different problems, along with a voting mechanism to choose the best approach, can enhance accuracy and robustness.The central goal is to develop a human-like intelligent agent framework that augments LLMs to better comprehend complex intentions, utilize knowledge and tools, learn actively, and reason flexibly - ultimately enabling more human-like problem solving. The paper presents OlaGPT as an implementation of this idea and evaluates it extensively on reasoning tasks.
