# [Less is More: Hop-Wise Graph Attention for Scalable and Generalizable   Learning on Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for learning circuit graph representations, but face challenges in scalability when applied to large graphs and exhibit limited generalizability to new circuit designs.
- Scaling GNN training to large circuit graphs is difficult due to the node dependencies in propagating information across the graph structure. Distributed training methods have high communication costs or rely on graph sampling algorithms that lose critical structural information.
- Existing GNN models also fail to capture critical high-order circuit structures, limiting their generalization capability across different circuit designs and tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes HOGA, a hop-wise graph attention model for scalable and generalizable circuit representation learning. 
- HOGA first precomputes hop-wise features for each node up to a fixed number of hops K. This avoids recursive neighbor aggregation during training.
- A novel gated self-attention module is then applied on the hop-wise features per node to produce the final node representations. This captures high-order feature interactions between different hops.
- Learning node representations independently facilitates distributed training and adaptation to various circuit structures.

Main Contributions:
- HOGA is the first scalable and generalizable model for circuit representation learning, achieved via a coarse-grained message-passing scheme based on hop-wise attention.
- By avoiding dependencies between nodes, HOGA training time scales almost linearly with more GPUs. Hop-wise feature generation is also very fast.
- The gated self-attention module enables HOGA to capture critical high-order circuit structures. Experiments show accuracy improvements of 46.76% for QoR prediction and 10% for functional reasoning over GNNs.

In summary, HOGA introduces a flexible hop-wise approach to overcome key limitations of GNNs for circuit representation learning tasks. It is scalable, generalizable, and shown to outperform prior GNN models.
