# [Less is More: Hop-Wise Graph Attention for Scalable and Generalizable   Learning on Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for learning circuit graph representations, but face challenges in scalability when applied to large graphs and exhibit limited generalizability to new circuit designs.
- Scaling GNN training to large circuit graphs is difficult due to the node dependencies in propagating information across the graph structure. Distributed training methods have high communication costs or rely on graph sampling algorithms that lose critical structural information.
- Existing GNN models also fail to capture critical high-order circuit structures, limiting their generalization capability across different circuit designs and tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes HOGA, a hop-wise graph attention model for scalable and generalizable circuit representation learning. 
- HOGA first precomputes hop-wise features for each node up to a fixed number of hops K. This avoids recursive neighbor aggregation during training.
- A novel gated self-attention module is then applied on the hop-wise features per node to produce the final node representations. This captures high-order feature interactions between different hops.
- Learning node representations independently facilitates distributed training and adaptation to various circuit structures.

Main Contributions:
- HOGA is the first scalable and generalizable model for circuit representation learning, achieved via a coarse-grained message-passing scheme based on hop-wise attention.
- By avoiding dependencies between nodes, HOGA training time scales almost linearly with more GPUs. Hop-wise feature generation is also very fast.
- The gated self-attention module enables HOGA to capture critical high-order circuit structures. Experiments show accuracy improvements of 46.76% for QoR prediction and 10% for functional reasoning over GNNs.

In summary, HOGA introduces a flexible hop-wise approach to overcome key limitations of GNNs for circuit representation learning tasks. It is scalable, generalizable, and shown to outperform prior GNN models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes HOGA, a hop-wise graph attention model for scalable and generalizable learning of circuit representations through distributed training of a gated self-attention module on precomputed hop-wise node features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing HOGA, a novel attention-based model for learning circuit representations in a scalable and generalizable manner. Specifically:

- HOGA is the first model to achieve both scalability and generalizability for circuit representation learning. This is enabled by its coarse-grained message-passing scheme based on hop-wise attention.

- By precomputing hop-wise features, HOGA avoids recursive neighbor aggregation during training. This allows it to learn each node representation independently, facilitating massive parallelization and distributed training. 

- Thanks to the proposed gated self-attention module, HOGA is able to adaptively learn critical and high-order circuit structures. This leads to significant improvements in accuracy over conventional GNNs for quality of results prediction and functional reasoning on new circuit designs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing HOGA, a scalable and generalizable graph learning approach for circuit representations, which is achieved through a novel hop-wise attention mechanism.

The paper proposes a new approach called HOGA (Hop-wise Graph Attention) for learning representations of circuit graphs. It uses a hop-wise aggregation scheme and gated self-attention module to make the model more scalable and generalizable. The approach is evaluated on two EDA tasks - QoR prediction using the OpenABC-D benchmark and functional reasoning using the Gamora methodology. Key terms like scalability, generalizability, gated self-attention etc. are associated with the core ideas presented in this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that HOGA is the first approach to achieve both scalability and generalizability for circuit representation learning. What specifically makes it more scalable compared to prior GNN models? Does computing the hop-wise features upfront contribute most to its scalability?

2. The gated self-attention module in HOGA aims to capture high-order feature interactions between different hops. However, the experiments only use a single gated self-attention layer. Does stacking more layers lead to learning even higher-order circuit structures? How does the performance scale with more layers?

3. For the QoR prediction task, HOGA seems to perform exceptionally well on the vga_lcd design, with a 46.76% error reduction over GCN. What characteristics of this design allow HOGA to excel compared to GCN? Can you further analyze the results?  

4. The paper mentions HOGA is a flexible approach that can be integrated with other custom techniques for various downstream tasks. Can you provide some examples of how HOGA can be customized? What components are easiest to modify?

5. Functional reasoning on technology mapped netlists is considered very challenging. Why does HOGA perform so much better than GNN baselines on this task? Does the hop-wise attention allow it to better capture functional blocks?

6. The visualization in Figure 5 is very insightful. However, it only shows attention scores for a 768-bit Booth multiplier. Would the attention heatmaps look significantly different for other types of multipliers? How about completely different circuit designs?

7. For distributed training of HOGA, are there any constraints on how the graph is partitioned between GPUs? Should certain types of nodes be kept together? Or can the graph be arbitrarily split?

8. The linear complexity analysis of HOGA seems very promising for scalability. However, are there any quadratic or cubic terms hidden in the constants of the big-O expressions? How do those scale in practice?

9. Could HOGA be applied to analog or mixed-signal circuits, instead of just digital designs? Would the hop-wise features be able to capture device-level physics like currents and voltages?

10. The paper focuses on integration of HOGA with EDA-specific models. Could HOGA also augment more general graph learning models? For example, could it replace message-passing in models like GNNs or GATs to improve their scalability?
