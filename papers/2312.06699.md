# [Leveraging Generative Language Models for Weakly Supervised Sentence   Component Analysis in Video-Language Joint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current models for video-language joint learning tasks like moment retrieval and video-text retrieval do not achieve a comprehensive understanding of the textual data. They fail to properly attend to and align all parts of the sentences with the corresponding videos. 

- For example, as shown in Figure 1, in a video moment retrieval task, the model attends well to the word "cat" in the query but fails to correlate "shot" with the video, resulting in incorrect outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a method to generate targeted hard negative and positive text samples from the original sentences using large language models (LLMs). 

- The hard negatives are generated by instructing the LLM to change a specific sentence component (e.g. verb, object) while keeping the rest same. The positives are generated by restructuring the whole sentence while maintaining semantics.

- These samples force the model to discern differences between sentence parts and align them better with videos during contrastive training.

- An adaptive importance estimation module is introduced to assign weights to the losses of different negative samples based on their estimated significance for each text.

Main Contributions:
- A mechanism to generate negative and positive samples targeting specific sentence parts using LLMs
- A pipeline to utilize the generated samples for improved video-text alignment via adaptive contrastive loss
- Consistent and significant improvement over baseline methods in moment retrieval and video-text retrieval tasks
- Provides insights into the models' decision process and shows the effect of emphasizing different sentence parts

In summary, the paper leverages LLMs to create hard samples for better video-language joint learning, through an adaptive contrastive learning framework. Both qualitative and extensive quantitative analysis on standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.
