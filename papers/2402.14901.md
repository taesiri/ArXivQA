# [A Usage-centric Take on Intent Understanding in E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying and understanding user intents is important for e-commerce recommendations, but intent understanding has not been clearly defined or evaluated. 
- Existing work blends intents with product properties or similar products, which does not align with the goal of recommending useful but superficially distinct products.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a "usage-centric" paradigm that focuses on predicative intents about how users use products, and on recommending kinds of products rather than individual listings.
- Identify two weaknesses in the state-of-the-art FolkScope intent knowledge graph: property ambiguity (intents poorly aligned with product properties) and category rigidity (intents strongly tied to only 1-2 product categories).
- Develop a Product Recovery Benchmark with a novel evaluation framework to recommend kinds of products solely from predicted intents, marginalizing other factors. Provide dataset based on Amazon Reviews.

Contributions:  
- Usage-centric formulation for intent understanding as a reasoning task to recommend superficially distinct products for common intents
- Analysis revealing weaknesses of property ambiguity and category rigidity in the state-of-the-art FolkScope
- Product Recovery benchmark and dataset for evaluating intent understanding methods
- Validation of FolkScope weaknesses on the new benchmark
- Advocating for using genuine user reviews to help address these weaknesses

In summary, the paper examines intent understanding from a usage-centric viewpoint, identifies weaknesses in the current state-of-the-art approach, and contributes a new benchmark to evaluate methods on reasoning about intents and product kinds. Analyzing FolkScope on this benchmark confirms its weaknesses, while utilizing user reviews is suggested as a promising direction.
