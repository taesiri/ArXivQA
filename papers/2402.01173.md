# [Efficient Prompt Caching via Embedding Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have high latency and resource consumption during inference due to their massive scale. 
- Caching responses to reuse for similar future queries can reduce calls to the LLM. 
- Existing semantic similarity embeddings may not accurately predict if two prompts can reuse the same response.

Proposed Solution: 
- Learn an embedding to predict if two prompts can reuse a response via similarity.
- Propose a distillation method to fine-tune an existing semantic embedding using a dataset labeled by an LLM.
- Compare binary cross entropy (BCE) and squared log difference (SLD) loss functions.
- Provide theoretical analysis bounding the generalization error.

Key Contributions:
- Construct a challenging dataset where an existing embedding achieves only 0.51 AUC.
- Achieve 0.81 AUC after fine-tuning, significantly improving over the existing embedding.  
- Demonstrate improved caching efficiency in simulations using the fine-tuned embedding over existing ones.
- Provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence and generalization ability of the method. 
- Compare BCE and SLD losses theoretically and empirically, showing BCE performs better.

In summary, the paper proposes a distillation based method to fine-tune embeddings to improve LLM caching efficiency, with solid theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy. The key insight is an embedding tailored to predict response re-useability rather than just semantic similarity.
