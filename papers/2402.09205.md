# [Tell Me More! Towards Implicit User Intention Understanding of Language   Model Driven Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Current language model-driven agents lack mechanisms for effective user participation, struggling to handle vague user instructions and grasp precise user intentions. This is problematic as vagueness is common in initial user requests, necessitating clarification.  

Proposed Solution: 
1) Introduce the Intention-in-Interaction (IN3) benchmark to evaluate agents' abilities to understand implicit user intentions through explicit interaction. 
2) Propose integrating small-scale "expert" models specialized in user interaction as upstream modules in agent systems to enhance intention understanding.  
3) Empirically adapt Mistral-Interact, an expert model trained on IN3 data, to judge task vagueness, inquire about details, and summarize intentions.

Integrate Mistral-Interact into the XAgent system for evaluation. Results show Mistral-Interact can correctly judge vagueness for 85% tasks, recover over 70% key missing details, summarize over 96% user intentions without omission, reduce unnecessary goals by 21% and lower tool invocation times during downstream execution, proving enhanced efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Formulate the novel problem of enhancing user-agent interaction via intention understanding 
- Release IN3 benchmark focusing on user participation in evaluation
- Propose incorporating specialized upstream interaction experts in agents
- Empirically validate approach by adapting Mistral-Interact and integrate it into XAgent system
- Comprehensively evaluate on instruction understanding and execution metrics
- Demonstrate efficiency improvements from intention understanding

The work reveals the viability of model experts for robust intention understanding during user-agent interaction, and promotes associated mechanisms and evaluation paradigms in agent designs.
