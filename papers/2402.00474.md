# [SA-MDKIF: A Scalable and Adaptable Medical Domain Knowledge Injection   Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00474)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on various natural language processing tasks. However, their application in the medical domain is limited due to the lack of specialized medical knowledge. Though some methods aim to inject medical knowledge by pretraining LLMs on medical corpora, this is computationally expensive and can lead to catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient framework to inject medical knowledge into LLMs while maintaining their generalization capability.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SA-MDKIF, a Scalable and Adaptable Medical Domain Knowledge Injection Framework consisting of two stages - skill training and skill adaptation. 

In the skill training stage, the authors design 12 basic medical skills covering various abilities (e.g. question answering, relation extraction etc.) needed for medical tasks. They use the AdaLoRA method to efficiently train parameters of these skills from skill-relevant datasets. 

In the next stage, a skill router is trained on downstream medical tasks to learn how to combine the medical skills. This router assigns different weights to skills by optimizing two objectives a) maximize likelihood of generating correct response b) regularize weights to prevent overfitting. The fine-tuned router and medical skills are then integrated with the original LLM for inference.

Based on the amount of downstream data, gradient descent or CMA-ES is used to compute router weights. This two-stage approach makes the framework efficient and adaptable.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of a novel two-stage framework SA-MDKIF that can inject medical knowledge into language models in a scalable and adaptable manner.

- Design of 12 basic medical skills and efficient training methodology using AdaLoRA.

- Introduction of a skill router that can dynamically combine skills for adapting to various downstream medical tasks.

- Extensive evaluation showing SA-MDKIF outperforms baselines by 10-30% on 9 datasets covering both normal and few-shot scenarios. Significant gains are obtained especially for unseen medical tasks.

Overall, SA-MDKIF provides an effective solution for integrating domain knowledge into LLMs while retaining their generalization ability, through its well-designed skill training and adaptable fusion stages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable and adaptable framework called SA-MDKIF that injects medical domain knowledge into general-purpose large language models through a two-stage process of skill training and downstream task-specific skill adaptation for improving performance on medical NLP tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes SA-MDKIF, a scalable and adaptable medical domain knowledge injection framework for large language models (LLMs). The framework has two stages - upstream skill training and downstream skill adaptation.

2. It designs 12 basic medical skills covering various types of medical knowledge. These skills are trained using the AdaLoRA method in the first stage.

3. It introduces a skill router-based method to adaptively combine the trained medical skills for injection into the LLM based on the specific downstream medical task. This allows flexible application to various tasks.

4. Extensive experiments show SA-MDKIF can significantly improve LLM performance on 9 downstream tasks, especially for unseen medical tasks where gains of up to 30% are observed. The performance matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while using only ~1% of parameters.

5. The proposed framework is scalable and adaptable. It can handle both normal and few-shot settings for downstream tasks. New skills can also be added to the framework in a straightforward manner.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective and flexible two-stage framework for injecting medical knowledge into general LLMs to boost their performance on medical NLP tasks. The design allows for scalability and adaptability to various downstream applications.

The paper presents a scalable and adaptable framework called SA-MDKIF for injecting medical domain knowledge into general-purpose large language models (LLMs). The goal is to enable the LLM's effective application in the medical domain. The framework has two core stages - skill training and skill adaptation. In the skill training stage, the authors design 12 basic medical skills and use AdaLoRA to train them. In the adaptation stage, a skill router is trained on downstream medical tasks to integrate the skills into the LLM during inference. Experiments are conducted on 9 downstream tasks categorized into unseen data and unseen task tracks. The results demonstrate significant improvements over the original LLM, showing the framework's effectiveness for medical domain knowledge injection and adaptability to various downstream tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage framework consisting of skill training and skill adaptation. Can you elaborate on why a two-stage approach is more effective than end-to-end training for this task? What are the advantages of decoupling the skill training and adaptation?

2. Twelve basic medical skills are defined in the paper. What considerations and criteria were used to design these skills? How do you ensure that they cover the necessary knowledge to solve a wide range of medical NLP tasks? 

3. The paper uses a unified instruction format to convert different types of data into context-query-answer triplets. What is the rationale behind using this format? How does it help in bridging the gap between skill training and adaptation stages?

4. AdaLoRA is used to train the medical skills. Can you explain why AdaLoRA was chosen over other parameter-efficient tuning methods? What modifications were made to the original AdaLoRA method for this framework? 

5. The skill adaptation stage uses a skill router to combine the trained skills. What are the advantages of using a skill router compared to simply equally weighting or randomly combining the skills?

6. Two strategies are proposed for skill router computation - gradient descent and CMA-ES. When is each one used and what are the motivations for using different strategies?

7. How does the paper evaluate model performance in normal and few-shot settings? What do these experiments demonstrate about the framework?

8. What downstream tasks were used for evaluation? Why were certain tasks considered "unseen" while others were not? What do the results on unseen tasks indicate?

9. How was the framework extended to incorporate new skills or tasks? What experiments were done to demonstrate this capability?

10. What ablation studies were performed? What do they reveal about the contribution of different components of the overall framework?
