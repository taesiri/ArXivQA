# [Gradient Boosting Neural Networks: GrowNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07971v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research contributions appear to be:- Proposing a novel framework called GrowNet that combines gradient boosting with neural networks. Instead of using decision trees as weak learners like traditional GBDT methods, GrowNet uses shallow neural networks as the weak learners in the gradient boosting process. - Developing a general gradient boosting neural network approach that can be applied to various machine learning tasks like classification, regression, and learning to rank. The paper shows how GrowNet can be adapted for these different tasks.- Incorporating innovations like adding second order statistics during training and a global corrective step to further boost model performance. These help improve stability and provide more precise tuning.- Demonstrating through experiments that GrowNet achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art boosting methods like XGBoost and AdaNet on multiple real-world datasets across the tasks of classification, regression, and learning to rank.- Performing ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of GrowNet like the corrective step, stacked architecture, dynamic boost rate, etc. This sheds light on what makes GrowNet effective.In summary, the key hypothesis appears to be that combining gradient boosting with shallow neural networks as weak learners can result in a flexible and high-performing approach that outperforms existing boosting techniques across a variety of machine learning tasks. The paper aims to demonstrate this via the proposed GrowNet framework.
