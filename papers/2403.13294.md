# [Map-Aware Human Pose Prediction for Robot Follow-Ahead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the robot follow-ahead task, where a mobile robot needs to drive in front of a moving human actor in an indoor environment while keeping sight of the actor. To accomplish this, the robot needs to understand the full 3D pose of the human and predict future poses to properly plan its path. This is challenging, especially in environments with multiple paths and junctions. 

Proposed Solution:
The main proposal is a real-time method to forecast the full 3D trajectory of a human by first predicting the 2D trajectory using map information and then estimating the 3D pose conditioned on the 2D prediction. 

The algorithm has two components:
1) PathNet: Predicts the 2D trajectory by taking as input past 2D poses and a local occupancy map around the human. Uses a U-Net architecture.
2) PoseNet: Predicts 3D poses over time by taking as input the predicted 2D trajectory and past 3D poses. Uses a GRU-based network.

The environment is represented via occupancy maps. The human pose history is encoded both as a 2D trajectory map and as relative 3D poses to the torso location.

Contributions:
1) A new real-time algorithm for human pose prediction that leverages maps of the environment and is 3x faster than prior work.
2) A new large-scale dataset (Real-IM) for pose forecasting recorded onboard a mobile robot over multiple buildings.
3) Demonstration of the complete system accomplishing robot follow-ahead in the real world by predicting poses in real-time and planning paths accordingly. The system does not rely on external cameras.

The method is evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on both pose and trajectory forecasting. Real robot experiments validate the approach and the need for prediction to accomplish the follow-ahead task successfully.
