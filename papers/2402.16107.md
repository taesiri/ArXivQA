# [FuseChat: Knowledge Fusion of Chat Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16107)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is very expensive and time-consuming. Multiple entities may develop LLMs with similar capabilities, leading to redundancy.
- Directly combining multiple existing LLMs through parameter blending is difficult due to their diverse architectures.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce \textsc{FuseChat}, an extension of \textsc{FuseLLM}, to transfer collective knowledge from multiple chat LLMs into a target LLM via a 2-stage approach:
  1) Knowledge Fusion: Conduct pairwise fusion to transfer knowledge from source LLMs into multiple target LLMs of identical architecture and scale.
  2) Model Merging: Merge target LLMs in parameter space using proposed \textsc{VaRM} method that determines merging weights based on variation ratio of parameter matrices.

Key Contributions:
- Extends flexibility and scalability of \textsc{FuseLLM} framework to fuse chat LLMs of varying sizes and architectures.
- Introduces pairwise knowledge fusion strategy and plug-and-play design to easily incorporate new source LLMs. 
- Proposes novel \textsc{VaRM} method to automatically compute fine-grained merging weights based on parameter matrix update ratios during training.
- Validation on MT-Bench shows \textsc{FuseChat} surpasses all source and baseline LLMs. With \textsc{VaRM}, it approaches SOTA open-source chat LLM NH2-Mixtral-8x7B.

In summary, the paper presents an effective approach to fuse knowledge and strengths from multiple chat LLMs into a unified model, reducing training costs while achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse chat tasks. The proposed techniques enhance flexibility and integration of model fusion.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FuseChat, an extended framework of FuseLLM, to effectively integrate the knowledge and capabilities of multiple chat language models with varying architectures and scales into a unified chat model through pairwise knowledge fusion and parameter-space merging guided by a novel variation-ratio based method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an extended framework called \textsc{FuseChat} to integrate the collective knowledge and individual strengths of multiple chat language models (LLMs) with varying architectures and scales into a more powerful chat LLM. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a fuse-then-merge strategy for fusing multiple chat LLMs, which first conducts pairwise knowledge fusion to obtain multiple target LLMs of the same structure and size, and then merges these target LLMs in the parameter space.

2) Introducing a novel merging method called \textsc{VaRM} (Variation Ratio Merge) to automatically determine the merging weights for target LLMs based on the variation ratio of parameter matrices before and after fine-tuning.

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of \textsc{FuseChat} by fusing three representative chat LLMs and showing that the fused model outperforms all individual source LLMs and even approaches the current state-of-the-art chat LLM.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an effective and scalable framework \textsc{FuseChat} to fuse knowledge and strengths from multiple varied chat LLMs into a superior unified model.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage framework called FuseChat for fusing multiple conversational AI models. Can you elaborate on the motivation and rationale behind adopting this two-stage approach rather than directly fusing all source models simultaneously? What are the advantages of this strategy?

2. The first stage of FuseChat employs pairwise knowledge fusion between a pivot model and each source model. What is the rationale behind using a pivot model instead of fusing all models directly? How is the pivot model selected and what criteria should be considered when selecting it? 

3. When conducting pairwise knowledge fusion in FuseChat, the paper uses minimum cross-entropy (MinCE) as the fusion function Fusion(). What is the working mechanism of MinCE? Why is it preferred over other fusion strategies like linear combination?

4. The second stage of FuseChat merges the obtained target models using VaRM method to determine merging weights. Can you explain in detail the mathematical formulation behind VaRM and how it computes the variation ratio of parameter matrices to assign merging weights? 

5. The granularity of merging in VaRM method is kept at matrix-level. What is the impact of using other levels of granularity like parameter-level or layer-level? What are the tradeoffs involved?

6. One of the highlights of FuseChat is the flexibility to plug-in new conversational models. Can you explain the steps involved if one wants to integrate an additional source model to the existing FuseChat framework?

7. The training dataset used in FuseChat comprises both human-written and model-generated conversations. What is the motivation behind using both? How can the dataset be further improved or expanded?  

8. How suitable is the evaluation benchmark MT-Bench for assessing multi-turn dialog capabilities of conversational models? What other benchmarks could complement it to provide a more comprehensive assessment?

9. The concept of knowledge fusion has similarities with ensemble methods or Mixture-of-Experts. What are the key differences that set it apart? What practical benefits does knowledge fusion provide over them?

10. FuseChat has shown promising results but what can be further improved in the method? What are interesting future directions for enhancing knowledge fusion capabilities of conversational AI models?
