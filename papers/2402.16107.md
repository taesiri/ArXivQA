# [FuseChat: Knowledge Fusion of Chat Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16107)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is very expensive and time-consuming. Multiple entities may develop LLMs with similar capabilities, leading to redundancy.
- Directly combining multiple existing LLMs through parameter blending is difficult due to their diverse architectures.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce \textsc{FuseChat}, an extension of \textsc{FuseLLM}, to transfer collective knowledge from multiple chat LLMs into a target LLM via a 2-stage approach:
  1) Knowledge Fusion: Conduct pairwise fusion to transfer knowledge from source LLMs into multiple target LLMs of identical architecture and scale.
  2) Model Merging: Merge target LLMs in parameter space using proposed \textsc{VaRM} method that determines merging weights based on variation ratio of parameter matrices.

Key Contributions:
- Extends flexibility and scalability of \textsc{FuseLLM} framework to fuse chat LLMs of varying sizes and architectures.
- Introduces pairwise knowledge fusion strategy and plug-and-play design to easily incorporate new source LLMs. 
- Proposes novel \textsc{VaRM} method to automatically compute fine-grained merging weights based on parameter matrix update ratios during training.
- Validation on MT-Bench shows \textsc{FuseChat} surpasses all source and baseline LLMs. With \textsc{VaRM}, it approaches SOTA open-source chat LLM NH2-Mixtral-8x7B.

In summary, the paper presents an effective approach to fuse knowledge and strengths from multiple chat LLMs into a unified model, reducing training costs while achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse chat tasks. The proposed techniques enhance flexibility and integration of model fusion.
