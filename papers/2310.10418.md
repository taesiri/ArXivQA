# [Reading Books is Great, But Not if You Are Driving! Visually Grounded
  Reasoning about Defeasible Commonsense Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10418)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:

1. To what extent can models align with average human judgment when reasoning about visually grounded defeasible commonsense norms?

2. How well can models generate explanations for their predicted judgments that align with human explanations? 

The authors construct a new multimodal dataset called NormLens to investigate these questions. The dataset consists of 10K human annotations covering 2K multimodal situations about commonsense norms. Using this dataset, the authors evaluate how well current state-of-the-art models can perform on two tasks: making moral judgments about visually grounded situations, and explaining the rationale behind those judgments. 

The key findings are:

- The judgment and explanation tasks are challenging even for large pretrained models. Models struggle to account for defeasible visual contexts and fail to identify cases where humans agree the action is impossible.

- Models can be improved by distilling commonsense knowledge from large language models, without needing additional human annotations. Fine-tuned models exhibit better alignment with humans.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that visual grounding is crucial for reasoning about defeasible commonsense norms in a human-like way. The new dataset and tasks are designed to probe current model capacities in this challenging setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing a new multimodal dataset called NormLens for studying visually grounded reasoning about defeasible commonsense norms. The dataset consists of 10K human annotations covering 2K multimodal situations.

2. Designing two tasks based on the dataset - making moral judgments about situations and explaining those judgments. Experiments show these tasks are challenging even for large pretrained models.

3. Proposing a new approach to improve model alignment with human judgments by distilling knowledge from large language models. This involves generating training data from an LM and fine-tuning models on it. Fine-tuned models show better agreement with humans.

In summary, the key contributions are a new multimodal benchmark for commonsense norms, formulation of two reasoning tasks on top of it, and a proposed method to improve model performance on these tasks using LM knowledge distillation. The work helps advance research on visually grounded reasoning about social acceptability and norms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new multimodal dataset and benchmark tasks to evaluate how well AI models can perform visually-grounded reasoning about commonsense norms in a way that aligns with human judgments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of visually grounded reasoning about commonsense norms:

- The focus on defeating commonsense norms based on visual context is novel. Most prior work has focused on textual defeaters or atomic/categorical grounding. Using free-form image captions provides a more natural form of grounding.

- Constructing a dedicated dataset for this task is a valuable contribution. The dataset covers diverse situations and actions, capturing the nuances of moral judgments. The multiple annotations account for subjectivity in judgments.

- The proposed benchmark tests are well-designed to assess model capabilities. requiring both visual grounding and reasoning about commonsense. Performance analysis on strong baselines reveals these are challenging tasks.

- Leveraging human-AI collaboration in data collection is creative. Using LMs to generate candidate situations, then filtering with humans, allows coverage of interesting cases.

- The distillation approach to improve models without extra human annotations is pragmatically useful. Though not a fundamental advance in capabilities, it demonstrates the utility of synthetic data.

- Compared to broader visual reasoning datasets, this work provides narrowly focused analysis on commonsense norms. While less general, it enables studying this societally important aspect in depth.

Overall, this paper makes focused contributions around an underexplored area. It opens up new directions at the intersection of vision, language, and social intelligence. The analyses provide insights into current model limitations, and point to needs for future work on aligned AI systems. The novel dataset and tasks are valuable resources for the research community.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing methods to further align model predictions with human judgments, especially for cases where the visual context induces defeasible commonsense norms. The authors note there is still a gap between model and human performance.

- Exploring ways to improve visual grounding and reasoning for this task. The authors found the visual modality and reasoning capability were both crucial. Enhancing these could lead to better model alignment.

- Scaling up the dataset to cover a broader range of situations and perspectives on commonsense norms. The authors acknowledge current limitations in diversity and aim to expand coverage.

- Studying disagreement and minority perspectives more closely rather than relying solely on majority judgments. The authors propose modeling individual annotator judgments as a direction. 

- Applying the idea of distilling knowledge from large LMs to improve multimodal models, without expensive human annotation. The authors showed this was a promising approach.

- Testing how well the ideas transfer to other multimodal reasoning tasks like abductive reasoning. The authors situate their work among visual reasoning tasks.

- Developing models that can provide better explanations for their normative judgments to increase transparency. The authors pose explanation generation as a challenging test.

In summary, the main future directions relate to improving alignment with human norms and reasoning, achieving broader coverage, handling disagreements, transferring techniques like distillation, and increasing explainability. Advancing multimodal reasoning and grounding is a central theme.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new multimodal dataset called NormLens for studying visually grounded reasoning about commonsense norms. The dataset consists of 10K human annotations covering 2K situations where each situation has a visual context and associated action. Multiple annotators provided judgments about whether the action is morally right or wrong in the context along with free-form explanations. The data collection process involved generating candidate situations using a language model, then having humans annotate the situations. Experiments show that predicting human judgments and explanations is challenging even for large pretrained models. The paper also proposes a method to improve model alignment with humans by distilling knowledge from a language model to fine-tune the models, which is shown to enhance performance without needing additional human annotations. Overall, the paper demonstrates the difficulty of visual commonsense reasoning and provides a new benchmark to spur progress in this area.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new multimodal dataset called NormLens for studying visually grounded reasoning about defeasible commonsense norms. The dataset consists of 10K human annotations covering 2K multimodal situations. Each situation includes a visual context (image) and associated action. Multiple annotators provided a moral judgment about the situation (wrong, okay, or impossible) along with a free-form explanation. 

The paper finds that state-of-the-art models struggle to align with human judgments and explanations for the visually grounded commonsense reasoning task posed by the dataset. The models have difficulty accounting for the visual context and determining when actions are impossible to perform. The authors propose improving alignment by distilling knowledge from a large language model to generate training data, then fine-tuning the models on this data. This approach better aligns models with human judgments, especially for the "wrong" and "impossible" classes. Overall, the new dataset highlights challenges models still face in grounded reasoning about commonsense norms.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces NormLens, a multimodal dataset/benchmark and tasks for studying visually grounded reasoning about defeasible commonsense norms. The key method is a data collection pipeline based on human-AI collaboration:

The authors first utilize a language model (LM) to generate a diverse set of multimodal situations (image-action pairs) that follow the requirement of featuring an action that is morally appropriate for a given image description but morally inappropriate for a generated context. This leverages the imagination and common sense of the LM. To filter the generated situations, prompt engineering and iterative refinement with the LM are used. 

Then, multiple human annotators provide moral judgments and free-form explanations for each situation. This accounts for the inherent subjectivity in moral reasoning. The dataset is analyzed to create high and medium agreement subsets based on inter-annotator agreement.

Finally, the dataset is used to test alignment of state-of-the-art models with human moral judgments and explanations. The authors find this challenging even for large models, indicating the need for visually grounded commonsense reasoning. A distillation method to improve model alignment without additional human annotation is also introduced, by generating more training data with the LM.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of visually grounded reasoning about defeasible commonsense norms. In particular, it is looking at how models can align with human judgment when making moral assessments about actions in visual contexts.

The key points are:

- Commonsense norms are highly dependent on context. For example, reading a book is usually considered positive, but it would be deemed wrong if done while driving a car. 

- Most prior work has focused on textual reasoning about defeasible norms. However, in real life, context is often conveyed visually rather than explicitly described. 

- Humans can naturally make intuitive judgments directly from a visual scene, but this ability is understudied in machines.

- The paper introduces a new multimodal dataset called NormLens to study this problem. It consists of 2K image-action pairs annotated with 10K human judgments and explanations.

- Two tasks are proposed on this data: (1) making aligned moral judgments, and (2) generating aligned explanations. Experiments show current models struggle, even large pretrained ones.

- A new distillation method is proposed to improve model alignment without extra human annotations. By generating training data from an LM, model scores are increased by up to 31.5% on the judgment task.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and analyzing the new problem of visually grounded reasoning about commonsense norms. The NormLens dataset provides a way to measure model alignment with human intuition in this context.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces NormLens, a new multimodal dataset for studying visually-grounded reasoning about commonsense norms. The dataset consists of 10K human judgments and explanations covering 2K multimodal situations depicting actions in visual contexts. The key idea is that commonsense norms are often defeasible - an action like reading a book is usually okay, but not when driving a car.

The resulting benchmark is analyzed to create high and medium agreement subsets based on annotator consensus. Using this data, the authors evaluate various models including VLMs and socratic models on aligned judgment prediction and explanation tasks.
