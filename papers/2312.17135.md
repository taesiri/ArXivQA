# [InsActor: Instruction-driven Physics-based Characters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17135)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "InsActor: Instruction-driven Physics-based Characters":

Problem: 
Generating realistic and controllable animations of physics-based characters using high-level human instructions is challenging. Existing methods either struggle to understand complex instructions or fail to produce accurate control for continuous physics-based characters. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes InsActor, a hierarchical framework to generate instruction-driven animations of physics-based characters. 

InsActor has two main components:
1) A high-level diffusion policy that takes as input the human instructions and generates a sequence of character poses (joint angles). The diffusion policy leverages recent advances in diffusion models to capture complex relationships between instructions and motions.

2) A low-level skill discovery module that maps transitions between pose pairs into a latent space. This handles invalid poses and infeasible transitions from the high-level policy. It uses an encoder-decoder architecture trained with a reconstruction loss and KL divergence loss for a compact latent space.

During inference, the diffusion policy first generates a pose sequence from the instruction. Then the skill discovery module encodes each pose transition into the latent space and decodes it to an action to control the character.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes InsActor, the first framework to generate long-horizon, instruction-driven animations of physics-based characters by modeling the intricate relationship between language and motions.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on instruction-driven motion generation and waypoint tasks. Generated animations are physically plausible and closely match human instructions.

- Demonstrates the flexibility of the framework to additional test-time conditions like waypoints through guided diffusion strategies.

- Extensive experiments analyze the importance of key components like the hierarchical design and skill space compactness.

In summary, InsActor advances physics-based character animation through intuitive human control using natural language instructions. The generated controllable and robust animations have diverse applications.
