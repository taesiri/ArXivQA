# [Look at the Neighbor: Distortion-aware Unsupervised Domain Adaptation   for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05493)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we effectively transfer knowledge from labeled pinhole image domains to unlabeled panoramic image domains for semantic segmentation, while addressing the key challenges of distortion problems and domain gaps?Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework to tackle the distortion problems caused by equirectangular projection in 360 panoramic images, and enable effective unsupervised domain adaptation from pinhole to panoramic imagery. The key ideas are:1) The paper finds that neighboring pixel regions in equirectangular projection (ERP) images have less distortion compared to using full global contexts. Based on this, a distortion-aware attention (DA) module is proposed to focus on local neighboring regions and capture pixel distributions.2) A relative positional encoding (RPE) is introduced to provide positional information about neighboring pixels, making DA more robust to distortion. 3) A class-wise feature aggregation (CFA) module aligns features between source and target domains by iteratively aggregating class-wise features into prototypical representations.4) The DA and CFA modules are integrated into a unified network architecture called DA-Transformer (DATR) for addressing the challenges of panoramic semantic segmentation in an unsupervised domain adaptation setting.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by using distortion-aware attention and feature alignment, the domain gap and distortion problems in transferring from pinhole to panoramic can be effectively addressed for semantic segmentation. The paper presents innovations in attention design and feature adaptation to validate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel distortion-aware attention (DA) module to capture the neighboring pixel distributions between domains. This helps address the distortion problem in transferring knowledge from pinhole to panoramic images. 2. It builds a hierarchically structured DA-based transformer (DATR) as a unified backbone model for panoramic semantic segmentation. Compared to prior complex models, DATR achieves better performance with significantly fewer parameters.3. It proposes a class-wise feature aggregation (CFA) module to iteratively update the features with a memory bank. This consistently optimizes the feature similarity between domains. 4. Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthetic-to-real and pinhole-to-panoramic transfer, with much fewer parameters. For example, it surpasses prior arts by 8.76% mIoU on synthetic-to-real with only 4.64M parameters.In summary, the key ideas are using distortion-aware attention to focus on neighborhood pixels to address distortion, building an efficient DA-based transformer backbone, and optimizing feature similarity across domains with the CFA module. The method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in panoramic semantic segmentation transfer.
