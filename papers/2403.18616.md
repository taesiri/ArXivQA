# [Will You Participate? Exploring the Potential of Robotics Competitions   on Human-centric Topics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the potential for robotics competitions focused on four human-centric topics - safety, privacy, explainability, and federated learning. It aims to understand the current research landscape and willingness of the robotics community to participate in such competitions.  

Methodology:  
A needfinding study is conducted through a survey of 34 participants from reputable European robotics consortia. The survey includes quantitative rating questions on a Likert scale and open-ended qualitative questions to gauge perspectives on the four topics.

Key Findings:
- Safety and explainability receive greater priority than privacy and federated learning in current and future robotics research.  
- There is low enthusiasm within the community for participating in competitions on these topics, especially privacy and federated learning.
- Barriers include lack of experience and perceived effort required for real robot testing.
- The machine learning community may be a better target audience.

Main Contributions:  
- First study investigating the potential for robotics competitions on these human-centric topics
- Analysis of research priorities and willingness to participate provides insights to guide future competitions 
- Recommendation to target machine learning rather than robotics community

In summary, this needfinding study offers valuable perspectives from the robotics community that can inform decisions about holding competitions on safety, privacy, explainability and federated learning in robotics. The low willingness to participate indicates alternate target communities should be considered.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Through a needfinding study surveying 34 participants across three European robotics consortia, this paper finds mainstream robotic researchers prioritize safety and explainability and are less enthusiastic to participate in competitions on privacy, federated learning, explainability, and safety.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper presents findings from an exploratory needfinding study investigating the current research status and potential participation of the robotics community in competitions focused on four human-centric topics: safety, privacy, explainability, and federated learning. The key contributions are:

1) A survey study with 34 participants from distinguished European robotics consortia to gather feedback on these topics from the perspective of the robotics/HRI research community.

2) Both quantitative analysis (statistics on survey responses) and qualitative analysis (coding of open-ended responses) to assess the current landscape and future interests regarding these topics. 

3) The findings suggest safety and explainability garner the most attention and willingness to explore further among mainstream roboticists, while privacy and federated learning are perceived as having lower potential currently.

4) The results indicate a lack of strong enthusiasm within the robotics community for participating in competitions on these topics, suggesting potential value in targeting other communities like machine learning instead.

In summary, the main contribution is gathering valuable insights through a needfinding methodology to understand perspectives from the robotics community on competitions involving these human-centric AI/robotics topics.

The keywords cover these main human-centric topics as well as the research methods used (needfinding, survey).


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper employs a "needfinding" method to gather requirements and perspectives from the robotics community. Can you explain in more detail what this needfinding process entails and why it was selected as the methodology? 

2. The survey study included 34 participants. What were the criteria for selecting these participants and do you think this sample size was sufficient to draw broad conclusions about the interests of the robotics community?

3. The survey questions use 7-point Likert scale responses in many cases. What is the rationale behind using a Likert scale here? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

4. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods are used on the survey data. Can you explain why both approaches were needed and what specific analysis techniques were leveraged under each one?

5. The paper identifies limitations around the depth of insights gathered through the online survey approach. What alternative data collection methods could have been used to gather richer, more contextual insights from participants?

6. Safety and explainability emerged as topics of greater interest than privacy and federated learning in the study results. Can you speculate on some underlying reasons why this might be the case? 

7. The results suggest lower enthusiasm for participating in competitions on these topics. Why might that be the case even for topics identified as important like safety?

8. The paper recommends targeting different communities, like machine learning, for competitions on these topics. Do you agree with that assessment and why?

9. Can you think of ways the questionnaire and analyses could have probed deeper into motivations and concerns around each of the four topics? What other question approaches may have yielded additional insights?

10. If you were to extend this work, what additional research questions would you want to explore around perspectives on these human-centric AI/robotics topics?
