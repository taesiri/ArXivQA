# [Towards a Zero-Data, Controllable, Adaptive Dialog System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling the behavior of dialog systems built using large language models (LLMs) is challenging, limiting their use in sensitive domains. 
- Existing approaches like FAQs lack personalization while handcrafted systems are not scalable.
- The recent Conversational Tree Search (CTS) approach allows controllability through expert-defined dialog trees, but still requires human data collection.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop prompts to automatically generate user questions and responses from dialog nodes, removing the human data requirement.  
- Test different generation methods and use metrics like diversity and answerability to select the best approach.
- Show through simulation and human evaluation that CTS agents trained on generated data perform comparably to those trained on human data.
- Demonstrate scalability by creating and evaluating performance on two new datasets spanning moving to a new country and medical diagnosis domains.

Main Contributions:
1) Creating two new public CTS datasets: ONBOARD and DIAGNOSE
2) Improving the CTS training procedure, increasing dialog success 
3) Developing a prompting approach to generate diverse and answerable user utterances
4) Showing no statistically significant difference between CTS agents trained on human vs. generated data
5) Demonstrating generalization ability to new domains with no need for human data collection

In summary, the paper develops a method to automatically create training data for dialog systems from expert-provided dialog trees only, eliminating the need for expensive data collection while maintaining control over system behavior. The approach is shown to scale to new domains without loss in performance.
