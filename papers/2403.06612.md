# [Pulling back symmetric Riemannian geometry for data analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06612)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world data often lies on low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds, so data analysis tools should account for this geometry. Riemannian geometry provides a framework for modeling nonlinear structure, but it's unclear how to construct suitable Riemannian metrics directly on the data space.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use a diffeomorphism to pull back the Riemannian metric from a symmetric space to the data space. This allows leveraging computational tools from symmetric spaces while providing flexibility to model the data geometry.

Key Contributions:

1) Characterize properties diffeomorphisms should satisfy:
- Map data manifold to low-dimensional geodesic subspace to enable proper interpolation and clustering
- Preserve local isometry around data for stability w.r.t. noise 

2) Modify algorithms on symmetric spaces for pullback geometry:
- Show low-rank approximation and autoencoder schemes can be adapted, preserving efficiency
- Latent space inherits interpretability if diffeomorphism satisfies key properties

3) Propose learning diffeomorphisms with regularizers for subspace constraint and isometry:
- Enables flexible data-driven construction of suitable Riemannian pullback metrics
- Validate on 2D toy data that this achieves superior interpolation, clustering and compression

In summary, the key insight is pullback geometry provides a mechanism to construct interpretable and efficient Riemannian data analysis tools by transferring structure from symmetric spaces. The paper provides guidance on properties pullback diffeomorphisms should satisfy and ways to learn them from data.
