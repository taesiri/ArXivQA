# [Improving genetic algorithms performance via deterministic population   shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Setting an appropriate population size is important for good performance of genetic algorithms (GAs), but most GAs use a fixed size throughout the run. 
- Intuition suggests that a varying population size could improve performance - larger early on for more exploration, smaller later for more exploitation.
- But there is little theory guiding the design of varying population size GAs.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a general framework for testing variable population sizing schemes in GAs using the lens of population sizing theory. 
- Estimate the minimum initial population size needed to supply enough building blocks for reliable convergence. Use this for both fixed and varying size GAs.
- Test a Simple Variable Population Sizing (SVPS) scheme that gradually and deterministically shrinks the population according to predefined speed and severity parameters.

Methodology: 
- Use bisection method to estimate minimum initial population for 98% convergence.
- Refine the initial population further through random removal.
- Test SVPS-GA with different speed and severity parameters while maintaining 98% convergence.
- Conduct experiments on trap functions of varying sizes and difficulties.

Results:
- SVPS-GA uses fewer evaluations than fixed-size GA, showing promise for varying population schemes.  
- The improvement in performance is more significant for larger and more difficult problem instances.
- There are clear patterns in useful combinations of SVPS parameters: fast shrinking speed but maintain most of initial population size.

Contributions:
- Framework for testing variable population sizing schemes while controlling for initial supply of building blocks.
- Demonstration that even a simple varying scheme can outperform fixed-size GA.
- Insights into dynamics and parameters of deterministic population shrinking.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework to test variable population sizing schemes in genetic algorithms and shows that a simple deterministic shrinking strategy can improve performance over fixed-size populations on trap function test problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It provides a general framework to test different variable population sizing schemes for genetic algorithms. The framework allows assessing the solution quality and computational effort required by different schemes.

2) It proposes a Simple Variable Population Sizing (SVPS) scheme that monotonically reduces the population size over the course of the GA run. The scheme is configured by a speed and severity parameter.

3) It conducts experiments using the framework on trap functions of different sizes and complexities. The experiments show that the SVPS scheme is able to improve GA performance (requiring fewer evaluations) while preserving solution quality compared to a fixed-size GA.

4) The analysis provides some insight into effective population shrinking dynamics, indicating that the GA tends to end with a high percentage of the initial population size but loses individuals early in the run. The analysis also shows larger instances require the population to remain intact longer before shrinking mainly at the end.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a general methodology for testing variable population sizing schemes and demonstrating that such schemes can improve performance over fixed-size populations in genetic algorithms.
