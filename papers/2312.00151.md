# [Which way is `right'?: Uncovering limitations of Vision-and-Language   Navigation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper investigates the limitations of current state-of-the-art Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models, which guide embodied agents to navigate to target locations by following natural language instructions. Specifically, the authors focus on path-ranking VLN models and aim to understand whether these models actually utilize spatial language and directional cues in the navigation instructions or just rely on recognizing objects/nouns while ignoring other parts of the instructions.  

Methods:
The authors design a set of ablation experiments where they mask or replace various parts of speech in the navigation instructions, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, spatial words, left/right, etc. They evaluate several top-performing VLN models using these modified instructions to analyze the change in navigation performance. The key research questions are - do VLN models rely more heavily on certain linguistic cues? And are they properly grounding spatial language like "turn left/right" into actions?

Results:
Surprisingly, the experiments expose that path-ranking VLN models rely almost exclusively on noun phrases in the instructions and completely disregard spatial language and directions. For instance, swapping "left" and "right" has negligible impact on the navigation success. On the other hand, sequential VLN models properly ground different parts of instructions including spatial language. 

The authors hypothesize that path-ranking models essentially turn the VLN task into an easier object matching problem between images and nouns rather than truly understanding instructions due to the simplicity of current VLN datasets and environments.

Contributions:  
1) Diagnostic analysis revealing limitations of path-ranking VLN models in grounding spatial language and over-reliance on nouns.

2) Comparative study highlighting different capabilities of path-ranking vs sequential models.

3) Two training procedures to alleviate noun reliance and improve utilization of spatial cues for path-ranking models.

In summary, this is an insightful study exposing flaws in current VLN models and benchmarks which can motivate building more complex datasets and better evaluation of model capabilities. The analysis also provides helpful training strategies to improve model grounding of spatial instructions.
