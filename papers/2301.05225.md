# [Domain Expansion of Image Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05225)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can we expand the image generation capabilities of a pretrained generative model to new domains, while preserving the model's existing knowledge and structure? 

The key hypothesis is that by repurposing "dormant" directions in the latent space that do not affect image generation, the model can expand to new domains in a disentangled way that does not disrupt the existing factors of variation learned for the original domain.

In summary, the paper introduces the novel task of "domain expansion" for generative models, and proposes a method to expand a pretrained model to new domains in a minimally disruptive way by leveraging the latent space structure. The central hypothesis is that dormant latent directions can be repurposed to represent new domains while maintaining disentanglement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new task called "domain expansion" of generative image models. The key ideas are:

- Domain expansion aims to augment a pretrained generator to model additional domains, while preserving its original capabilities. This is in contrast to domain adaptation methods that override the original domain.

- The paper proposes a method to structure the latent space of a generator to support representing new domains in a disentangled manner. Specifically, it repurposes "dormant" directions that do not affect the original generator's output to capture new factors of variation. 

- They show this method can expand a single generator to hundreds of new domains while maintaining quality and disentanglement. This allows capabilities like composing domains that were never seen jointly during training.

- The proposed training paradigm is simple and flexible. It can transform different domain adaptation methods like StyleGAN-NADA and MyStyle into domain expansion techniques.

- Experiments demonstrate the advantages over domain adaptation methods. A single expanded generator can supersede hundreds of individually adapted generators.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the domain expansion task and a simple yet effective technique to achieve it by structuring the latent space to repurpose dormant directions. This expands the capabilities of generative models in a minimally invasive way.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new task called domain expansion, which augments the image space of a pretrained generative model by repurposing its dormant latent directions to represent new domains, while preserving the model's original capabilities.
