# [Domain Expansion of Image Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05225)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can we expand the image generation capabilities of a pretrained generative model to new domains, while preserving the model's existing knowledge and structure? 

The key hypothesis is that by repurposing "dormant" directions in the latent space that do not affect image generation, the model can expand to new domains in a disentangled way that does not disrupt the existing factors of variation learned for the original domain.

In summary, the paper introduces the novel task of "domain expansion" for generative models, and proposes a method to expand a pretrained model to new domains in a minimally disruptive way by leveraging the latent space structure. The central hypothesis is that dormant latent directions can be repurposed to represent new domains while maintaining disentanglement.
