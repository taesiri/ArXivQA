# [Recursive Cross-Modal Attention for Multimodal Fusion in Dimensional   Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on multi-modal dimensional emotion recognition from videos containing facial, vocal and textual cues. Effectively fusing information from multiple modalities is challenging. Prior fusion methods using recurrent networks or attention do not fully leverage the complementary nature across modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a recursive cross-modal attention (RCMA) mechanism to capture inter-modal and intra-modal relationships for audio, visual and text features.

- Intra-modal relationships are modeled using temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) applied individually on each modality. 

- Inter-modal relationships are modeled using a cross-modal attention block. The attention block computes a cross-correlation between one modality's features and a joint representation of the other two modalities. This is done recursively to refine the representations.

- The attended features from each modality are concatenated and fed to FC layers for valence/arousal prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Novel recursive cross-modal attention mechanism to effectively model both inter- and intra-modal relationships for video emotion recognition.

- Achieves state-of-the-art results on the AffWild2 dataset by effectively fusing audio, visual and text modalities using the proposed approach.

- The concept of computing cross-attention between a single modality and joint representation of other modalities is introduced.

- Demonstrates the value of recursive application of cross-modal attention to refine modality-specific representations.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative recursive cross-modal fusion technique for multi-modal emotion recognition that outperforms prior art on a challenging video dataset.
