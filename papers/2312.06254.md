# [Modyn: A Platform for Model Training on Dynamic Datasets With   Sample-Level Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06254)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Modyn, a new open-source platform for training machine learning models on dynamic datasets that change over time. Modyn focuses on enabling efficient sample-level data selection and configurable triggering policies for model retraining. It provides optimizations like data partitioning, prefetching, and parallelization to achieve high throughput data retrieval during training, despite having to fetch individual data samples instead of large chunks. Modyn includes benchmark models and datasets and has an extensible architecture to allow easy exploration of different triggering policies, data selection strategies, and compression techniques. The authors evaluate Modyn's throughput, showing it reaches 80-100% of the throughput achieved when sequentially reading data locally without sample selection for a memory-bound recommendation system workload and a compute-bound vision workload. They also demonstrate Modyn's usability by training models with three different data selection policies on a real-world dynamic dataset. Modyn enables both systems researchers to explore infrastructural optimizations and machine learning researchers to validate continual learning techniques at scale under distribution shift.
