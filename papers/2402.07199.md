# [Link-aware link prediction over temporal graph by pattern recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07199)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Link prediction is an important task on temporal graphs, which aims to predict whether a query link will exist between two nodes based on historical links. 
- Prior methods have focused on learning node representations and aggregating neighborhood information. However, they are "link-unaware" as they do not utilize information about the query link when learning the representations. This can lead to side effects by absorbing noisy information.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a link-aware model called Temporal Graph Attention Convolution Network (TGACN) which takes both historical links and the query link as input.  
- It focuses on modeling link evolution patterns rather than node representations. The key idea is to check if the input links contain a reasonable pattern ending with the query link.

Main Contributions:
- Develops a link-aware model that utilizes the query link for effective link prediction, through jointly modeling historical and query links.
- Proposes a parametric sampling method to efficiently sample useful historical links conditioned on the query link.
- Captures patterns at different granularities with transductive and inductive attention mechanisms. 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 6 datasets and also provides interpretability on which historical links are most relevant to predicting each query link.

In summary, the key novelty is in being link-aware, by incorporating the query link information into all components of the model - sampling, attention and pattern recognition. This allows better utilization of information relevant to each specific prediction. Both the performance and interpretability results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed temporal graph attention convolution network.
