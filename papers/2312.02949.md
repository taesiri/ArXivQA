# [LLaVA-Grounding: Grounded Visual Chat with Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02949)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces LLaVA-Grounding (LLaVA-G), a large multimodal model designed for grounded visual chat. The authors make several key contributions: 

1) They create a grounded visual chat (GVC) dataset with 150K instances by leveraging human-annotated object detection data and GPT-4's language capabilities. This allows combining high-quality visual grounding data with natural conversations.

2) They propose an end-to-end network architecture connecting a language model with a grounding model (OpenSeeD). This facilitates both object and pixel-level grounding from the language queries. 

3) They establish a Grounding-Bench benchmark to assess models on grounded visual chat through metrics like grounded precision, grounded recall and chat scores. 

4) Through experiments, they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of LLaVA-G on Grounding-Bench. It also achieves competitive scores on RefCOCO and Flickr30K entities compared to other grounding LMMs. Qualitative results further showcase LLaVA-G's capabilities for diverse grounding types, hallucination reduction and debugging.

In summary, through innovations in data, modeling and benchmarking, this paper pushes the boundaries of integrating grounding abilities in large multimodal chat models, with analysis showing clear benefits. The data and benchmark specifically stand out as valuable contributions to drive further progress.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown exceptional visual chat abilities but struggle with fine-grained visual understanding and grounding due to lack of high-quality grounded visual chat data and suboptimal model designs. 
- Existing models treat grounding separately, focus only on short captions, output box coordinates rather than masks, and have limited support for visual prompts.

Proposed Solution:
- Created a grounded visual chat (GVC) dataset with 150K samples by leveraging human-labeled detection data and GPT-4's annotation capabilities.
- Proposed an end-to-end model, LLaVA-Grounding, that connects a segmentation model (OpenSeeD) with a language model (Vicuna-7B) to enable pixel-level grounding and chat.
- Introduced capabilities to handle various visual prompts like clicks, boxes and marks.

Main Contributions:
- GVC dataset creation using human-labeled detection data and GPT-4.
- End-to-end LLaVA-Grounding model for grounded chat with support for pixel-level grounding and diverse visual prompts.
- Grounding Bench benchmark to assess grounded chat capabilities with new metrics like grounded recall and precision.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art grounded chat performance and competitive grounding results on RefCOCO/+/g and Flickr30K Entities.

The key novelty is the ability to perform high-quality grounded chat by combining advances in language models, grounding models and data creation. The solution enables robust pixel-level grounding fully integrated with the chat functionality.
