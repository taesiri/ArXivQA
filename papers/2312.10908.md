# [CLOVA: A Closed-Loop Visual Assistant with Tool Usage and Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10908)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing visual assistants that utilize large language models (LLMs) to integrate visual tools (e.g. OpenCV functions, visual models) have limited generalization capability when deployed to new environments requiring specific knowledge not covered by the frozen tools. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes CLOVA, a closed-loop visual assistant with inference, reflection and learning capabilities to continually update its tools to adapt to new environments.

Key components:
- Inference Phase: Uses LLMs to generate programs and execute tools to accomplish tasks based on correct and incorrect demonstration examples
- Reflection Phase: Identifies tools needing updates via a multimodal global-local reflection scheme analyzing environmental feedback  
- Learning Phase: Collects training data flexibly through LLM inference, open datasets and web search to update tools via a training-validation prompt tuning scheme; also updates LLMs themselves through demonstrations

Main Contributions:
1) A visual assistant with closed-loop learning to update tools for better adaptation to new environments
2) A multimodal global-local reflection scheme to identify tools needing updates
3) Three flexible manners to collect training data without human involvement
4) A training-validation prompt tuning scheme to efficiently update tools with potentially noisy data while avoiding catastrophic forgetting

Experiments:
- Tasks: compositional VQA, multi-image reasoning, image editing, knowledge tagging
- Outperforms prior tool-usage methods by 5% in VQA/reasoning, 10% in tagging, 20% in editing
- Shows significance of learning capability for general visual assistants

The key novelty is the closed-loop learning framework that enables the assistant to continually improve itself by updating both language and visual models in response to environment feedback.
