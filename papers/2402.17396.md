# [Benchmarking GPT-4 on Algorithmic Problems: A Systematic Evaluation of   Prompting Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17396)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 to generalize systematically on algorithmic reasoning tasks. These tasks require applying the same solution procedure recursively to simplify complex symbolic expressions step-by-step.
- The authors note LLMs lack systematic generalization, i.e. the ability to extrapolate learned statistical patterns to more complex instances outside the training distribution.
- The paper examines how different prompting techniques impact the performance of LLMs on algorithmic tasks with increasing levels of complexity.

Methods:
- Three algorithmic reasoning tasks are defined: ListOps, arithmetic expressions and algebraic expressions. Complexity is controlled by nesting depth and number of operands.
- Seven prompting techniques are tested, ranging from zero-shot to chain-of-thought prompting that demonstrates step-by-step reasoning.
- GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are evaluated and compared to a Neural Data Router model designed specifically for such tasks. 

Results:
- No model or prompting technique could perfectly solve the tasks, indicating a fundamental limitation in systematic generalization.
- GPT-4 with self-consistency prompting performs the best overall. Prompting methods that elicit explicit reasoning steps give superior accuracy.  
- Performance gains are concentrated on simpler instances. All models struggle on deeply nested expressions with multiple operands per operation.
- The specialized Neural Data Router is competitive with GPT-3.5, suggesting value in architecting models specifically for algorithmic reasoning.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic benchmarking of GPT-4 against GPT-3.5 and a specialized model on three algorithmic tasks with increasing complexity.
- Analysis of seven prompting techniques regarding their ability to improve systematic generalization.
- Demonstration that advanced prompting can make GPT-4 highly performant but limitations remain in extrapolating solution procedures to complex instances.
- Results highlight challenges in achieving human-like compositional understanding of symbolic expressions in large language models.

In summary, the paper provides a thorough investigation of algorithmic reasoning abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, using controlled algorithmic tasks and prompting techniques to diagnose strengths, weaknesses and opportunities regarding systematic generalization.
