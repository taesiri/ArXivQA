## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new framework for high-speed motion planning of aerial swarms in unknown and cluttered environments. 

Problem:
Coordinated flight of drone swarms allows faster accomplishment of tasks like search and rescue. However, current approaches are unable to fully leverage the speed and robustness of drones, especially in unknown environments with obstacles. They are also decentralized and don't consider communication latency delays.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed solution consists of a mapping module to generate a voxel grid representation of the environment from sensor data, including classification of voxels as free, occupied or unknown. This voxel grid is input to a planning module with two sub-modules running in parallel:

1) Global Path Generation: Uses jump point search on a potential-field-transformed voxel grid to efficiently find an initial path to the goal. Then a distance map A* search finds an optimized path with sufficient clearance from obstacles.

2) Trajectory Generation: Constructs a Time-Aware Safe Corridor (TASC) around the global path that avoids static obstacles and other agents using separating hyperplanes. An adaptive-speed reference trajectory sampling this corridor is input to an MIQP optimization to generate a smooth, dynamically feasible trajectory.

The two modules run fully decentralized on each agent with communication between agents each planning cycle. The method explicitly accounts for communication latency and packet loss.

Main Contributions:

- First decentralized planning framework for high-speed navigation of drone swarms in unknown environments.

- Explicitly reasons about unknown space to guarantee safety.

- Runs faster (67% higher speed) with lower flight times (42% reduction) than state-of-the-art methods.

- Validated in simulation and real-world experiments to showcase dynamically feasible trajectories.

In summary, this is a novel approach enabling drone swarms to navigate cluttered, unmapped environments quickly and safely by combining environment mapping, global path planning and localized trajectory optimization. The decentralized architecture and robustness to imperfect communication make it suitable for real-world deployment.
