# [Bimonoidal Structure of Probability Monads](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03527)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is defining and studying the bimonoidal structure of probability monads. The key points are:

- They argue that for a monad to properly model probability, it should have compatible monoidal and opmonoidal structures (a bimonoidal structure). This allows modeling joints, marginals, and independence of random variables.

- They give a definition and graphical interpretation of monoidal, opmonoidal, and bimonoidal monads in terms of commutative diagrams. 

- They show how a bimonoidal structure allows defining functions of and between random variables.

- They construct a category of probability spaces from a bimonoidal monad which inherits the monoidal structure.

- They prove that on cartesian monoidal categories, a bimonoidal structure corresponds to a commutative strength. But a bimonoidal structure is more general.

- They define stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure and relate it to other definitions in the literature.

- They give the Kantorovich monad on complete metric spaces as a nontrivial example of a bimonoidal monad where the underlying category is not cartesian monoidal.

In summary, the key contribution is formalizing the bimonoidal structure needed for a categorical probability monad and demonstrating its usefulness through several examples and results. This provides a framework to treat joints, marginals, and independence abstractly.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on categorical probability theory:

- The focus on bimonoidal structure for probability monads is novel. As the authors mention, monoidal and opmonoidal monads have been studied, but the full bimonoidal structure does not seem to have been considered explicitly before in relation to probability theory. This provides a framework to formally discuss concepts like joint distributions and marginals.

- The graphical calculus used is similar to other graphical languages for monoidal categories, like the one introduced by Melli√®s. Using string diagrams helps illustrate the conceptual ideas clearly. 

- The notion of independence defined in terms of the bimonoidal structure is closely related to other categorical definitions, like the one given by Franz using tensor categories with projections. The authors show the equivalence in the case of cartesian base categories. 

- Looking at independence for non-cartesian monoidal structures is an interesting generalization. The example of the Kantorovich monad demonstrates that the definitions extend meaningfully to settings beyond cartesian monoidal categories.

- Overall, the conceptual style is similar to other foundational work in categorical probability theory, like the work of Jacobs, Franz, Simpson, etc. The focus is on formalizing basic probability concepts like independence in categorical terms.

- Compared to more applied work, this paper is quite theoretical. The examples illustrate the definitions but probabilistic insights are limited. This is typical of foundational theory-building papers in this field.

In summary, the novel contribution is the systematic study of bimonoidal structure in relation to probability monads. This provides a formal basis to discuss joints, marginals and independence abstractly. The paper relates well to other literature, while extending the foundation to new settings like non-cartesian monoidal categories.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop more examples of bimonoidal monads, especially on non-cartesian monoidal categories, to further demonstrate the usefulness of this framework. The Kantorovich monad given in this paper is one example, but more are needed.

- Study in more detail the algebra and coalgebra of random variables enabled by the bimonoidal structure. The authors mention this briefly in Section 4.2, but more work can be done to elucidate the precise structures that arise.

- Investigate other notions of independence beyond the one defined in this paper, and relate them to the bimonoidal structure. There may be other useful ways to formalize independence that are compatible with this framework.

- Explore applications of bimonoidal monads to probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference. The authors suggest the framework could be relevant for these areas.

- Generalize the results on equivalence of notions of independence (Section 6.2) to non-cartesian monoidal categories, or find counterexamples if such generalizations are not possible. 

- Study relationships between bimonoidal monads and other monoidal structures that arise in probability theory, such as convolution monoidal structures.

- Develop more examples of bimonoidal monads beyond probability theory, to better understand their potential as a general mathematical concept.

In summary, the main directions are developing more examples, especially in non-cartesian settings, further investigating the theory, and exploring applications in probabilistic programming and related applied areas. The bimonoidal framework shows promise, but more foundational and applied work is needed.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper gives a categorical treatment of joints, marginals, and independence for probability monads. It introduces the notion of a bimonoidal monad, which is a monad on a monoidal category that has both a monoidal and an opmonoidal structure that interact nicely. This provides a formalism for talking about forming joints and marginals in a consistent way. The authors argue this is the right structure to capture probability theory concepts like stochastic independence, as opposed to just a monoidal monad. They interpret the definitions using a graphical calculus, and show that for cartesian monoidal categories, a commutative strong monad is automatically bimonoidal. They also give a definition of stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure, and show it agrees with other definitions in the literature in the cartesian case. As an example, they prove the Kantorovich monad on complete metric spaces is bimonoidal, using the product probability for joints and the usual marginals.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper gives a conceptual treatment of the notion of joints, marginals, and independence in the setting of categorical probability. It does this by endowing probability monads, like the Giry monad and probabilistic powerdomain, with a monoidal and an opmonoidal structure that are compatible (a bimonoidal structure). In the case of a cartesian monoidal base category, a commutative strength is enough to guarantee a bimonoidal structure, as for the probabilistic powerdomain. However, for non-cartesian monoidal base categories, a strength is not enough - the full bimonoidal structure is needed to capture joints and marginals. 

The authors explain the theory using graphical calculus and give a definition of stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure. This generalizes other notions of independence in the literature. As an example, they show the Kantorovich monad on complete metric spaces is bimonoidal for a non-cartesian monoidal structure. Overall, the paper provides a conceptual framework for modelling joints, marginals, and independence of probability monads categorically using bimonoidal structures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a bimonoidal structure for probability monads in order to formalize concepts of joints, marginals, and independence of random variables in categorical probability theory. The main method is to define a monoidal structure $\nabla: PX \otimes PY \to P(X\otimes Y)$ that combines probability measures into a joint distribution, and an opmonoidal structure $\Delta: P(X\otimes Y) \to PX \otimes PY$ that extracts marginals. These are required to satisfy certain coherence conditions to form a bimonoidal monad. Key results show that bimonoidality implies that correlation can be "forgotten" but not created, and captures a notion of independence based on reconstructing a joint from marginals. The bimonoidal approach generalizes the notion of a strong monad, and is illustrated on the Kantorovich monad for probability measures on metric spaces. The main contribution is a conceptual framework using monoidal category theory to formalize stochastic dependence in categorical probability.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:

How can we formalize the notions of joints, marginals, and independence for probability distributions in a general categorical framework?

The key points are:

- Standard probability monads like the Giry monad and probabilistic powerdomain allow modeling random variables in a category. However, they do not automatically have a way to talk about joints and marginals of these random variables.

- The authors argue that the right structure to capture joints and marginals is a bimonoidal structure on the probability monad. This consists of a monoidal structure to form joints, an opmonoidal structure for marginals, and compatibility conditions between the two.

- In the case of cartesian monoidal categories, a commutative strength is enough to guarantee a bimonoidal structure. But for non-cartesian monoidal categories, a strength is not sufficient - the full bimonoidal structure is needed.

- The bimonoidal structure allows defining stochastic independence in categorical terms. The definition agrees with standard probability theory when the base category is cartesian monoidal.

- As an example, the authors show the Kantorovich monad on complete metric spaces is bimonoidal, for a non-cartesian monoidal structure given by the metric.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that bimonoidal monads are the right framework to formalize joints, marginals and independence for probability monads in general monoidal categories. The paper provides the definitions, interprets them probabilistically, and shows the approach generalizes previous work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper gives a conceptual treatment of randomness and probability theory using categorical probability monads endowed with a monoidal and opmonoidal structure to formalize the notions of joints, marginals, and independence.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the following main issues:

1) How to formalize the notion of joints, marginals, and independence for categorical probability theory in a conceptually clear way. 

2) Why a bimonoidal structure, consisting of both a monoidal and an opmonoidal structure, is the right framework to capture these concepts for probability monads. 

3) Providing a notion of stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure that satisfies expected properties and connects with other literature.

4) Demonstrating that the Kantorovich monad on complete metric spaces is an example of a bimonoidal monad, even though the underlying category is not cartesian monoidal.

In more detail:

- The paper argues that a bimonoidal structure, not just a strength, is needed to fully capture joints and marginals for probability monads. This is especially true when the underlying category is not cartesian monoidal.

- A bimonoidal monad is defined formally, consisting of a monad that is both monoidal and opmonoidal in a compatible way.

- A notion of stochastic independence is given based on the bimonoidal structure. It has reasonable properties and agrees with other definitions in the cartesian monoidal case.

- As an example, it is shown the Kantorovich monad has a bimonoidal structure coming from product joints and marginals. This provides a nontrivial example of a bimonoidal probability monad where the underlying category is not cartesian monoidal.

So in summary, the main focus is on clarifying the categorical framework for dealing with joints, marginals, and independence for probability monads in general, beyond just the cartesian monoidal case. The bimonoidal perspective provides a conceptually clear way to capture these notions.

The paper develops a conceptual framework for modeling joints, marginals, and independence of random variables in categorical probability theory using monoidal monads. It introduces the notion of a bimonoidal monad, which combines a monoidal and opmonoidal structure, as a way to formally capture these probabilistic concepts. As an example, it shows the Kantorovich monad on complete metric spaces has a natural bimonoidal structure.

Key terms revolve around monoidal category theory applied to probability, including monads, strengths, bimonoidal functors/monads, and graphical calculus. The bimonoidal structure allows defining joints, marginals, and independence. The Kantorovich monad example demonstrates these ideas on metric measure spaces.

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper "Bimonoidal Structure of Probability Monads" introduces a bimonoidal structure for probability monads to model the concepts of joints, marginals, and independence in categorical probability theory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper gives a conceptual treatment of joints, marginals, and independence in categorical probability theory. It endows probability monads (like the Giry monad) with a monoidal and opmonoidal structure that are mutually compatible, forming a bimonoidal structure. This allows defining stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure, compatible with intuition and other approaches. For cartesian monoidal categories, a commutative strength defines a bimonoidal structure uniquely. But for non-cartesian monoidal categories, a strength is not enough - a bimonoidal structure is needed. As an example, the paper shows the Kantorovich monad on complete metric spaces is bimonoidal for a non-cartesian monoidal structure. Overall, the paper argues bimonoidal monads properly capture randomness, allowing concepts like independence, unlike some other monads. The bimonoidal perspective generalizes strengths and provides the right requirements for probability monads.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper studies the categorical structure of probability monads, which provide a framework for reasoning about randomness in category theory. It argues that the standard notion of a strong monad is insufficient to properly describe joints and marginals in non-cartesian monoidal categories. Instead, it introduces the concept of a bimonoidal monad, equipped with both a monoidal and opmonoidal structure that interact nicely. This allows defining products of random variables and extracting their marginals. An equivalent formulation uses the graphical calculus for monoidal categories, which gives an intuitive diagrammatic understanding. A notion of stochastic independence is then defined based on the ability to reconstruct a joint from its marginals. As an example, it is shown that the Kantorovich monad for probability measures on metric spaces has a natural bimonoidal structure, derived from the product measure and marginals. Overall, the bimonoidal framework provides a robust categorical setting for probability theory beyond the cartesian case. The graphical calculus also connects to other graphical languages for probabilistic reasoning.
