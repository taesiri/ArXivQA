# [Bimonoidal Structure of Probability Monads](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03527)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is defining and studying the bimonoidal structure of probability monads. The key points are:- They argue that for a monad to properly model probability, it should have compatible monoidal and opmonoidal structures (a bimonoidal structure). This allows modeling joints, marginals, and independence of random variables.- They give a definition and graphical interpretation of monoidal, opmonoidal, and bimonoidal monads in terms of commutative diagrams. - They show how a bimonoidal structure allows defining functions of and between random variables.- They construct a category of probability spaces from a bimonoidal monad which inherits the monoidal structure.- They prove that on cartesian monoidal categories, a bimonoidal structure corresponds to a commutative strength. But a bimonoidal structure is more general.- They define stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure and relate it to other definitions in the literature.- They give the Kantorovich monad on complete metric spaces as a nontrivial example of a bimonoidal monad where the underlying category is not cartesian monoidal.In summary, the key contribution is formalizing the bimonoidal structure needed for a categorical probability monad and demonstrating its usefulness through several examples and results. This provides a framework to treat joints, marginals, and independence abstractly.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on categorical probability theory:- The focus on bimonoidal structure for probability monads is novel. As the authors mention, monoidal and opmonoidal monads have been studied, but the full bimonoidal structure does not seem to have been considered explicitly before in relation to probability theory. This provides a framework to formally discuss concepts like joint distributions and marginals.- The graphical calculus used is similar to other graphical languages for monoidal categories, like the one introduced by Melli√®s. Using string diagrams helps illustrate the conceptual ideas clearly. - The notion of independence defined in terms of the bimonoidal structure is closely related to other categorical definitions, like the one given by Franz using tensor categories with projections. The authors show the equivalence in the case of cartesian base categories. - Looking at independence for non-cartesian monoidal structures is an interesting generalization. The example of the Kantorovich monad demonstrates that the definitions extend meaningfully to settings beyond cartesian monoidal categories.- Overall, the conceptual style is similar to other foundational work in categorical probability theory, like the work of Jacobs, Franz, Simpson, etc. The focus is on formalizing basic probability concepts like independence in categorical terms.- Compared to more applied work, this paper is quite theoretical. The examples illustrate the definitions but probabilistic insights are limited. This is typical of foundational theory-building papers in this field.In summary, the novel contribution is the systematic study of bimonoidal structure in relation to probability monads. This provides a formal basis to discuss joints, marginals and independence abstractly. The paper relates well to other literature, while extending the foundation to new settings like non-cartesian monoidal categories.
