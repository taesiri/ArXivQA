# [DecompDiff: Diffusion Models with Decomposed Priors for Structure-Based   Drug Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07902)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate novel 3D ligand molecules that can bind to a target protein binding site. Existing SBDD methods treat all ligand atoms equally and generate them from a single Gaussian prior distribution. However, atoms within a ligand molecule play different roles - some atoms (arms) directly bind to the target while other atoms (scaffold) connect the arms. Treating all atoms equally is inefficient for exploring the large drug-like molecular space. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new diffusion model, called DecompDiff, for SBDD. The key ideas are:

1) Decompose ligand molecules into arms and scaffold, and model them with separate informative priors estimated from data. This decomposition better respects the natural interaction between ligands and targets. 

2) Introduce a diffusion process on bonds to generate atoms and bonds simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion, instead of relying on a separate post-processing step. This improves the quality of generated molecular structures.

3) Incorporate validity guidance terms during sampling to promote connections between arms and scaffold, and avoid clashes between generated molecules and the target surface. This further improves validity of the generated ligands.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a diffusion model with decomposed priors over arms and scaffold for SBDD, which better captures the natural decomposition of ligand molecules

- Develops a framework to generate atoms and bonds simultaneously through bond diffusion, improving quality of generated molecular structures

- Designs validity guidance terms to encourage generation of complete and clash-free ligand molecules  

The proposed DecompDiff model outperforms previous SOTA methods on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, achieving the best binding affinity and success rate in generating valid drug-like molecules. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/DecompDiff.
