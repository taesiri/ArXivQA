## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generative AI for Controllable Protein Sequence Design: A Survey":

Problem: 
Designing novel protein sequences with desired functions is a key challenge in bioengineering fields like drug discovery and enzymatic engineering. However, navigating the vast space of possible proteins is extremely difficult due to time and cost constraints. Recent advances in AI, especially generative models and optimization algorithms, are revolutionizing this field by allowing intelligent exploration of the protein sequence space.

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a systematic review of techniques using generative AI for controllable protein sequence design. It first introduces key concepts like deep generative models (VAEs, GANs, diffusion models) and optimization algorithms (LSO, RL, evolution, Bayesian optimization). It then categorizes controllable design tasks into:

1) Structure-to-sequence design: Generating sequences that fold into a given protein backbone structure. Common approaches are autoregressive, one-shot, and iterative refinement.

2) Function-to-sequence design: Generating sequences with desired functional properties. Key methods are de novo generation, de novo optimization using RL or classifier guidance, and mutation-based optimization.  

3) High-level design: Incorporating broader constraints beyond structure and function, like specifying a target protein or providing textual descriptions.

The paper also reviews recent advances in distribution learning on natural protein sequences using language models like ProtGPT2 and diffusion models like EvoDiff. Finally, it highlights applications in designing peptides, antibodies, and enzymes.

Main Contributions:
- Provides the first comprehensive taxonomy of controllable protein sequence design tasks based on constraints 
- Systematically reviews generative models and optimization methods applied to this domain
- Analyzes recent distribution learning works capturing properties of natural protein sequences
- Examines multiple applications benefiting from controllable protein design
- Identifies key open challenges and future opportunities to advance this rapidly evolving field

In summary, this paper offers an extensive overview of the landscape, methodologies, applications and open questions around using generative AI for customizable and automated protein design.
