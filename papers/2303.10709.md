# [NeRF-LOAM: Neural Implicit Representation for Large-Scale Incremental   LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10709)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the central research question is how to develop an approach for simultaneous odometry and mapping using LiDAR data in large-scale outdoor environments. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel neural radiance field (NeRF) based method called NeRF-LOAM to address the limitations of existing LiDAR-based odometry and mapping methods when applied to large-scale outdoor scenarios with sparse LiDAR data. The key hypothesis appears to be that a NeRF-based approach can overcome these limitations and achieve high-quality odometry estimation along with dense mapping for large outdoor environments using only LiDAR data as input.
