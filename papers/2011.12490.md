# [DeRF: Decomposed Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12490)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we accelerate the inference speed and improve the rendering quality of neural radiance fields (NeRF) by using a spatial decomposition approach?Specifically, the authors propose a technique called Decomposed Radiance Fields (DeRF) that divides a 3D scene into multiple spatial regions, with each region modeled by a smaller neural network. Their key hypotheses are:1) There are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and wider) networks for NeRF. Using multiple smaller networks dedicated to spatial regions can compensate for this.2) A decomposition based on Voronoi diagrams is preferable, as it results in convex cells that can be rendered independently and efficiently composited using the Painter's algorithm.3) Training an end-to-end differentiable Voronoi decomposition allows finding an optimal arrangement of cells for a given scene.4) DeRF can achieve faster inference speed without loss of quality, or better quality for the same inference cost compared to vanilla NeRF.So in summary, the central research question is how a spatial decomposition approach like DeRF can improve upon standard NeRF in terms of efficiency and quality. The hypotheses focus on the benefits of smaller networks per region, using Voronoi diagrams for decomposition, and end-to-end learning of the decomposition.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we improve the efficiency (i.e. reduce inference time) of neural radiance fields for neural rendering, while maintaining or improving rendering quality?The key ideas and contributions to address this question appear to be:- Observing that there are diminishing returns in terms of rendering quality when simply increasing the capacity (width and depth) of the networks used in NeRF models. - Proposing a spatial decomposition approach where the scene is divided into multiple parts, each handled by smaller network "heads". This exploits the diminishing returns observation.- Using a differentiable Voronoi decomposition to divide the scene, which enables end-to-end training.- Showing that a Voronoi decomposition allows efficiently rendering each part independently and compositing with the Painter's algorithm.- Demonstrating up to 3x speedup in inference compared to NeRF with no loss in quality, or up to 1.0 dB higher PSNR with equal inference cost.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that spatial decomposition with smaller networks can improve NeRF efficiency, and they propose and validate a Voronoi decomposition approach to achieve this. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate or summarize any other aspects of the paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents DeRF (Decomposed Radiance Fields), a method to improve the efficiency of neural radiance fields (NeRF) for photo-realistic rendering. The key contributions are:- It highlights the diminishing returns in rendering quality as network capacity is increased in NeRF, and proposes using spatial decomposition with smaller networks to address this.- It shows how decomposing the scene into convex Voronoi cells allows rendering the parts independently and compositing with the Painter's Algorithm, making it efficient and GPU-friendly.- The Voronoi decomposition is made differentiable so it can be learned and adapted to a particular scene. - A uniformity loss is introduced to balance the decomposition and utilize all the networks evenly.- Experiments show the method can achieve up to 3x faster inference than NeRF without loss of quality, or a PSNR improvement of 1.0 dB for the same cost.In summary, the main contribution is a learned Voronoi decomposition approach to improve the efficiency and/or quality of neural radiance field rendering. The key idea is that smaller networks can be used for spatial parts of a scene due to diminishing returns, while compositing with the Painter's Algorithm maintains efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract and skimming the paper, the main contribution appears to be a technique for improving the efficiency of neural radiance fields for 3D scene representation and rendering. Specifically, the authors propose spatially decomposing the scene into multiple regions, each handled by a smaller neural network. This allows them to mitigate the issue of diminishing returns when increasing network capacity, as well as take advantage of more efficient GPU memory access patterns. The use of Voronoi diagrams for the spatial decomposition is highlighted as being compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for compositing the final image. Experiments demonstrate their method can provide up to 3x speedup in inference without loss of quality, or improved quality for the same inference cost compared to baseline NeRF. The main novelty seems to be using the spatial decomposition with smaller networks per region to improve efficiency, enabled by the properties of the Voronoi diagram.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on neural radiance fields and volumetric rendering:- It builds directly on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by Mildenhall et al. (2020), which showed that neural networks can represent complex radiance fields for novel view synthesis. This paper proposes a modification to NeRF's architecture.- The key idea is to decompose the scene into multiple regions with smaller radiance field networks, rather than using one large network for the whole scene like NeRF. This is motivated by observing diminishing returns when increasing network capacity in NeRF. - Other works have also tried to improve NeRF's efficiency, such as Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (Liu et al. 2020) which focuses on adaptive sampling. This paper tackles efficiency from a different angle through decomposition. The two approaches could be complementary.- Decomposition ideas have been explored in other volumetric representations like Neural Volumes (Lombardi et al. 2019), but not for radiance fields. This paper shows it can work for NeRF's continuous representation too.- The decomposition uses a Voronoi diagram, which is a novel approach in this context. It allows convex region rendering that is proven compatible with the Painter's algorithm for efficient compositing.- Experiments demonstrate the decomposition leads to faster rendering for the same quality, or better quality for the same render time compared to NeRF. The gains are shown on complex real-world scenes.So in summary, this paper builds closely on NeRF with a well-motivated modification using decomposition and Voronoi diagrams. It expands the efficiency frontier for neural radiance fields in a different way than prior works. The experiments demonstrate clear improvements on challenging photorealistic datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a comparison to other related research:- This paper proposes a neural scene representation based on spatial decomposition into smaller, independent networks. Other methods like NeRF use a single large network to represent the entire scene. Splitting the scene into parts is a novel way to improve efficiency and quality.- The decomposition is done using a differentiable Voronoi diagram, which is a new approach in this field. Other papers have tried voxel or regular grid decompositions. The Voronoi diagram allows convex region representation optimized for the Painter's algorithm.- Using the Painter's algorithm for compositing is also unique. Most neural rendering methods rely on alpha compositing. Showing the compatibility with Painter's algorithm and leveraging it for efficiency is a key contribution.- The concept of diminishing returns in network capacity seems underexplored in neural rendering. Identifying this issue and using decomposition to address it is novel. Other methods simply scale up capacity uniformly.- Compared to concurrent work like Neural Sparse Voxel Fields, this method provides complementary benefits by focusing on sampling efficiency vs rendering efficiency. So the two could potentially be combined.- Overall, the decomposed representation and analysis of diminishing returns to motivate it are the main novelties compared to prior neural rendering techniques. The Voronoi decomposition and Painter's algorithm are technical innovations that enable the core idea.In summary, I believe the spatial decomposition framework and the insights around network capacity are the primary new contributions compared to other neural rendering papers. The method seems unique and complementary to other recent work in this dynamic field. Let me know if you would like me to expand on any specific comparison!


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more efficient inference methods for neural volume rendering models like NeRF. The authors highlight that current models are very computationally intensive, taking minutes to render a single image. Improving inference speed while maintaining quality would expand the applicability of these models.- Exploring heterogeneous decompositions with heads of varying capacity. The paper uses heads with the same architecture, but notes it could be beneficial to have some heads with less or no capacity for simple empty areas.- Implementing more efficient scatter/gather operations to accelerate training. The current training procedure of the decomposition is slower than without decomposition. Better hardware/software for these types of operations could speed up training.- Applying the spatial decomposition concept to other neural rendering architectures beyond NeRF. The core idea of dividing a scene and using smaller networks may be applicable to other volumetric and view synthesis models.- Testing the robustness of the method with more runs. The variance experiments show differences based just on initialization. More comprehensive studies could further validate the benefits.- Examining the scene decomposition and compositing strategy. While Voronoi diagrams worked well here, there may be even better ways to decompose and composite scenes for neural rendering.- Extending the approach to video and dynamic scenes. The current method focuses on static scenes. Adapting it for video or non-rigid motion could be an impactful but challenging direction.In summary, the main themes suggested are improving efficiency, testing the generalization of the core ideas, and expanding the scope to dynamic scenes. The decomposed rendering strategy appears promising, but there are many open questions to continue exploring.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more efficient implementations and optimizations of the DeRF framework to further improve rendering speed and enable scaling to more complex scenes.

The authors suggest combining DeRF with other works like NeRF-W to enable modeling of dynamic elements.- Applying the decomposition concept to other neural rendering techniques beyond NeRF, such as neural volume rendering and image-based rendering methods. - Exploring other decomposition strategies beyond Voronoi diagrams to represent scenes, and studying their efficiency and rendering quality trade-offs.- Improving the training stability and speed of DeRF models, which currently train slower than non-decomposed models. Techniques like pre-training may help here.- Conducting more extensive experiments and ablation studies to further analyze DeRF performance with different hyperparameters, scenes, and metrics. The authors mention using multiple runs to get more robust quantitative results.- Developing extensions and applications of DeRF for tasks like view synthesis, 3D-aware image editing, and neural compression.In summary, the main directions are improving efficiency, extending to dynamics, applying decomposition more broadly in neural rendering, enhancing training, and conducting more rigorous experimentation and analysis. The core ideas could open many avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents DeRF (Decomposed Radiance Fields), a method to improve the inference efficiency of neural radiance fields (NeRF) for novel view synthesis. The key idea is to spatially decompose the scene into multiple parts and dedicate smaller neural networks to represent each part. This exploits the observation that there are diminishing returns when increasing the capacity of the networks in NeRF, so using multiple smaller networks can be more efficient. The decomposition is done using a differentiable Voronoi diagram, which allows end-to-end training to find an optimal decomposition. The Voronoi cells can be rendered independently using the Painter's algorithm and composited together to form the final image. This results in more efficient inference, allowing 3x faster rendering than NeRF at equal quality, or up to 1dB higher PSNR at equal inference cost. Experiments on real-world scenes demonstrate the benefits over NeRF baselines.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a technique for neural radiance fields based on spatial decomposition in order to improve rendering efficiency and quality. The key idea is that there are diminishing returns when employing larger neural networks, so the authors propose decomposing the scene spatially and using smaller networks focused on each part. This allows for faster rendering as each part can be rendered independently. The authors use a Voronoi diagram to decompose the scene, as it results in convex cells that can be rendered independently using the Painter's algorithm. This avoids issues with random memory access that other decomposition techniques like a regular grid or learned MLP decomposition encounter. The Voronoi decomposition is made differentiable so it can be tuned end-to-end for a specific scene. The authors show experimentally that their technique can provide up to 3x faster inference than vanilla NeRF with the same quality, or a 1.0 dB increase in PSNR with the same inference cost. The method works for both real and synthetic scenes. Limitations include slower training time due to scene decomposition.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a technique for neural volume rendering based on spatial decomposition in order to improve inference efficiency. The key idea is that instead of using a single large neural network to represent a 3D scene, the scene is decomposed into multiple parts which are each represented by smaller neural networks. The authors propose using a Voronoi diagram to spatially partition the scene into convex cells. Each cell is rendered independently using a smaller network, and then the final image is composited using the Painter's algorithm. The Voronoi decomposition is differentiable so it can be learned end-to-end along with the neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that this approach can provide up to 3x faster inference compared to regular Neural Radiance Fields, or alternatively can give higher quality renders for the same inference cost. The decomposition allows constant inference time regardless of how many parts the scene is divided into. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results on photorealistic rendering of complex real-world scenes.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:The paper proposes a technique for accelerating the inference speed of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models using spatial decomposition. The key idea is that neural networks exhibit diminishing returns in rendering quality as capacity increases, so the scene can be divided into multiple smaller regions represented by smaller networks. Specifically, they propose decomposing the scene into convex cells using a differentiable Voronoi diagram parametrization. Each Voronoi cell is assigned its own neural network to represent the radiance and density within that region. During rendering, each cell can be rendered independently using the Painter's algorithm to composite the final image. This allows constant inference time regardless of the number of cells, while dedicating smaller networks to represent detailed local regions. The Voronoi decomposition is trained end-to-end to find an optimal arrangement of cells for representing the scene radiance field. Experiments show the method achieves up to 3x faster inference than vanilla NeRF without loss of quality, or a PSNR improvement of 1.0 dB for equal inference cost.

It decomposes the scene into multiple convex cells defined by a learned Voronoi diagram, with each cell rendered by a separate smaller network. This allows constant inference time regardless of the decomposition level, and improves efficiency by up to 3x without loss of quality compared to the NeRF baseline.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the abstract, introduction and method sections, this paper appears to address the following main problem:Neural radiance fields (NeRF) can generate high quality novel views of a 3D scene using neural networks, but rendering these images is very computationally intensive. This limits the practical applicability of NeRF models. The key question the paper seems to be addressing is:How can the computational efficiency of neural radiance field rendering be improved while maintaining high rendering quality?To summarize, the main points are:- NeRF produces high quality renderings but is very slow.- Increasing network capacity leads to diminishing returns in rendering quality. - The paper proposes using spatial decomposition with smaller networks in each part to improve efficiency.- They use a Voronoi diagram decomposition that is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient compositing.- This allows constant inference time regardless of how many parts the scene is decomposed into.- Experiments show this achieves up to 3x faster inference than NeRF at equal quality, or up to 1.0 dB higher PSNR at equal inference cost.So in essence, the paper tackles the problem of NeRF's slow rendering speed by using a spatial decomposition technique that breaks the scene into parts handled by smaller networks. This improves efficiency while maintaining quality.
