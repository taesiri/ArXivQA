# [LLM Maybe LongLM: Self-Extend LLM Context Window Without Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01325)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on sequences of limited length, restricting their ability to process longer contexts during inference. When tested on sequences exceeding the pretraining length, performance severely degrades.
- Existing methods try to extend the context window via fine-tuning, but this may cause overfitting and lose capabilities on short sequences. Some non-finetuning methods only utilize local information so cannot fully elicit LLMs' potential.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper argues LLMs have an inherent capability to handle long contexts, but this is limited by out-of-distribution relative positions not seen during pretraining. 
- They propose SelfExtend to address this positional out-of-distribution issue without any fine-tuning. It uses a floor operation to map unseen large relative positions to those observed during pretraining.
- SelfExtend merging two attention mechanisms: grouped attention with floor mapping for long-range tokens, and normal self-attention for local neighbor tokens.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the concept that LLMs have untapped inherent long context abilities, rather than lacking capability.
- Develops SelfExtend method to elicit this capability and extend context length without any training, via simple remapping of relative positions.
- Demonstrates through extensive experiments that SelfExtend boosts performance on language modeling, synthetic and real-world long context tasks.
- Shows comparable or better performance versus fine-tuning methods, highlighting latent potential of LLMs and possibilities for exploiting this without tuning.

In summary, the key innovation is reframing the context limitation as an out-of-distribution issue and addressing it by revealing LLMs' untapped capabilities, rather than externally training improvements. This is shown to be highly effective across tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Self-Extend, a simple yet effective method to elicit large language models' inherent ability to handle long text sequences without any fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors argue that large language models (LLMs) have an inherent ability to handle long text sequences, even if they were not exposed to very long sequences during pretraining. This is an important conceptual contribution. 

2. To elicit this inherent long context ability, the authors propose a simple but effective method called Self-Extend. It extends the context window of LLMs during inference by mapping unseen large relative positions to known positions using a floor operation. This allows maintaining coherence over longer texts without additional fine-tuning.

3. Through comprehensive experiments, Self-Extend is shown to substantially improve the long context understanding ability of various LLMs. Surprisingly, it even outperforms some fine-tuning based methods on certain tasks, despite not requiring any training. This demonstrates the potential of LLMs for long context tasks.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) the conceptual argument about inherent long context abilities of LLMs, (2) the proposed Self-Extend method to elicit this ability without fine-tuning, and (3) experimental validation showing improvements over fine-tuning baselines.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Context window extension 
- Long context understanding
- Self-attention

- L-Eval benchmark

The paper proposes a method called "Self-Extend" to elicit the inherent capabilities of large language models to handle long text sequences, without requiring any fine-tuning. It addresses the "positional O.O.D." issue that arises when LLMs encounter unfamiliar relative token distances during inference on texts longer than their pretraining context window. The proposed solution uses a "floor" operation to map the unseen relative positions to familiar ones from pretraining. The effectiveness of Self-Extend is evaluated on tasks like language modeling, passkey retrieval, and real-world QA datasets from LongBench and L-Eval. The results demonstrate Self-Extend's ability to extend LLMs' context window and long context understanding abilities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that large language models have an inherent ability to handle long contexts even if they have only seen short contexts during pretraining. What evidence or analysis supports this argument? How convincing is this argument?

2. The proposed SelfExtend method uses a simple floor operation to map unseen relative positions to seen ones during pretraining. Why is this mapping function a sensible choice? What are the pros and cons of using the floor operation versus a more complex mapping?  

3. The paper shows low perplexity can be achieved on long contexts using SelfExtend. However, the passkey retrieval experiments show this does not necessarily mean true long context understanding. What explains this discrepancy? How should long context language modeling be evaluated?

4. Ablation studies showed smaller group sizes lead to better performance on some datasets. What is the tradeoff between using smaller versus larger group sizes in SelfExtend? Is there a principled way to set the group size?

5. SelfExtend merges normal self-attention for neighbor tokens with grouped self-attention for distant tokens. What is the motivation behind keeping normal self-attention locally? How is the performance impacted by the neighbor window size?

6. How does SelfExtend theoretically extend the maximum context length that can be handled? What practical issues limit reaching the theoretical maximum length? Can SelfExtend work with infinity length contexts?

7. SelfExtend improves performance over base LLMs on various long context tasks. How does it compare to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches? What are the relative pros and cons? When would each be preferred?

8. What types of long context tasks or datasets does SelfExtend underperform on compared to fine-tuning methods? Are there commonalities in these datasets that explain why? How could SelfExtend be improved?

9. The paper hypothesizes that extending context length without fine-tuning allows maintaining performance on short contexts. Does analysis support this? Are there cases or metrics where performance on short contexts still degrades?

10. SelfExtend only modifies inference and does not require training. Does this mean it cannot fully realize the potential performance gains from adapting the model architecture itself to handle long contexts? What architectural changes could further improve capabilities?
