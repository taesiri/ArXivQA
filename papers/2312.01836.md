# [Integrated Drill Boom Hole-Seeking Control via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01836)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling drill booms for underground rock drilling is challenging due to their high degrees of freedom (DOFs) and harsh conditions. 
- Existing methods use a hierarchical framework with inverse kinematics solutions and sequential joint control which is computationally complex and inefficient.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an integrated drill boom control framework using reinforcement learning (RL) to directly learn a policy mapping states to joint control actions. 
- This eliminates the need for inverse kinematics solutions and allows for cooperative multi-joint control to improve efficiency.

Methodology:
- Formulates drill boom control as a Markov decision process (MDP) with carefully designed state and action representations.
- State includes Denavit-Hartenberg joint information and current + preview drill end deviations from target hole. 
- Actions defined as rate of change of joint angles/positions.
- Reward function encourages reducing deviations and smooth control actions.
- Various RL algorithms tested, with Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) performing the best.

Main Contributions:
- First integrated framework for drill boom control using RL, eliminating inverse kinematics solutions.
- Specially designed state representation enhancing accuracy throughout drilling process.
- Demonstrated high hole-seeking accuracy (<1cm error) and 5.7x improved efficiency over hierarchical methods in simulations.
- Proposed method has strong potential for enhancing efficiency and safety of real-world drilling operations.

In summary, the paper puts forth an RL-based integrated control approach for drill booms that achieves cooperative multi-joint control, does not need inverse kinematics, and significantly improves performance over traditional techniques. Careful MDP formulation and simulations demonstrate the promise of this method.
