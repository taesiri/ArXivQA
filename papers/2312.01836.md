# [Integrated Drill Boom Hole-Seeking Control via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01836)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based integrated control framework for robotic drill boom hole-seeking. The key idea is to directly learn a parameterized policy that generates coordinated control actions for all drill boom joints simultaneously based on the current joint state and target hole information. Specifically, the joint state is represented using 8-dimensional Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and the target hole information utilizes both current and preview position deviations to ensure accuracy. By formulating hole-seeking as a Markov decision process and applying advanced RL algorithms, an integrated multi-joint policy can be optimized offline to enable efficient online execution without needing iterative inverse kinematics solutions. Experiments demonstrate that this framework significantly enhances both hole-seeking precision and time efficiency compared to traditional hierarchical approaches. The state-of-the-art performance shows promising potential to advance intelligent drilling technology for practical applications such as underground excavation.
