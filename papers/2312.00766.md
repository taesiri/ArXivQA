# [Automated Material Properties Extraction For Enhanced Beauty Product   Discovery and Makeup Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00766)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an automated pipeline leveraging multiple machine learning models to extract material properties like color, finish type, and reflectivity from images of makeup products. The goal is enhancing product discovery and enabling virtual try-on experiences. The pipeline handles challenges in analyzing diverse eyeshadow products and is shown to extend well to other makeup categories like lipstick and foundation. First, an image selection model chooses the most representative product image as input. Then, specialized models detect the number of shades, classify the format, identify base/reflective colors, and categorize the finish type. Extensive experiments demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness for single and multi-shade eyeshadow products. Comparisons to human annotations reveal the superior consistency of the machine learning models. The incorporated material attributes significantly improve cross-category makeup-to-outfit and makeup-to-makeup recommendations. A user study validates that recommendations leveraging these extracted properties are preferred 78% of the time over a baseline approach. Ultimately, this automated material property extraction pipeline enhances the shopping experience through tailored product suggestions and enabling realistic virtual try-on.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors propose a novel learning-based pipeline utilizing multiple neural network models to extract material properties like color, finish type, etc from images of makeup products. The key aspects of their contribution are:

1) They design an end-to-end pipeline specifically for extracting all the material properties needed to render/visualize makeup products digitally.

2) The pipeline is versatile to handle different types of makeup products like eyeshadow, lipstick, foundation. This is shown through experiments.

3) They demonstrate applications of the extracted material properties in improving relevance of recommendations (both makeup to makeup and clothing to makeup recommendations) as well as enabling virtual try-on experiences. 

4) Through ablation studies and comparisons to human annotations, they demonstrate superiority of their learning based pipeline over manual labeling.

In summary, the main contribution is an automated pipeline for makeup material property extraction that enhances product discovery and recommendations, and facilitates virtual try-on applications. The effectiveness of the pipeline is shown through quantitative experiments and qualitative visualization.
