# [Automated Material Properties Extraction For Enhanced Beauty Product   Discovery and Makeup Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00766)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an automated pipeline leveraging multiple machine learning models to extract material properties like color, finish type, and reflectivity from images of makeup products. The goal is enhancing product discovery and enabling virtual try-on experiences. The pipeline handles challenges in analyzing diverse eyeshadow products and is shown to extend well to other makeup categories like lipstick and foundation. First, an image selection model chooses the most representative product image as input. Then, specialized models detect the number of shades, classify the format, identify base/reflective colors, and categorize the finish type. Extensive experiments demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness for single and multi-shade eyeshadow products. Comparisons to human annotations reveal the superior consistency of the machine learning models. The incorporated material attributes significantly improve cross-category makeup-to-outfit and makeup-to-makeup recommendations. A user study validates that recommendations leveraging these extracted properties are preferred 78% of the time over a baseline approach. Ultimately, this automated material property extraction pipeline enhances the shopping experience through tailored product suggestions and enabling realistic virtual try-on.
