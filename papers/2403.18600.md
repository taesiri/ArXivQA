# [RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Planner for Adaptive Procedure Planning in   Instructional Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Previous works on procedure planning from instructional videos make unrealistic assumptions that the number of steps is fixed and known in advance. However, in real-world scenarios, the sequence length varies depending on the complexity of the task.  
- There is a high correlation between consecutive action steps that is modeled implicitly in prior works, leading to subpar results.  
- Prior methods rely on expensive fully-annotated data, limiting scalability.

Proposed Solution - Retrieval Augmented Planner (RAP):

- Introduces a new practical setting called "adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos" where procedure length is variable and not pre-determined. 

- Uses an auto-regressive Transformer model as the base planner to generate plans of flexible lengths by predicting an END token.

- Augments the base planner with a retrieval memory module that explicitly exploits temporal relations between steps by retrieving relevant state-action pairs from training data to refine the predicted plan.

- Introduces a weakly-supervised training approach to expand the training set to unannotated but task-relevant videos by generating pseudo-labels through a video-language grounding algorithm.

- Defines a new evaluation metric called edit-score to better assess variable length sequence predictions.

Main Contributions:

- Identifies unrealistic assumptions in prior works and defines the new problem of adaptive procedure planning from videos.

- Proposes the RAP model incorporating auto-regressive planning, retrieval augmentation and weak supervision to address key limitations. 

- Achieves state-of-the-art results on CrossTask and COIN benchmarks, establishing RAP as a strong baseline.

- Introduces the edit-score metric for more comprehensive assessment of variable length procedure planning.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in accurately and flexibly predicting procedures from instructional videos by tackling critical limitations of prior arts through the proposed RAP framework and a weakly supervised learning approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Retrieval-Augmented Planner (RAP) model to tackle key challenges in procedure planning from instructional videos, including handling variable-length plans, exploiting temporal relations, and reducing annotation costs, demonstrating superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a new setting called "adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos" where the length of the predicted procedure is not fixed or predetermined, unlike in previous works. 

2. Proposing a model called Retrieval-Augmented Planner (RAP) to address the challenges in adaptive procedure planning. RAP can generate procedures of variable lengths, retrieve step temporal relation knowledge, and learn from additional unannotated videos.

3. Introducing a weakly-supervised training approach to expand the training data using unannotated but task-relevant videos, in order to learn procedural knowledge more efficiently.

4. Introducing a new evaluation metric called "edit-score" to better assess variable-length procedures, as compared to metrics like accuracy that have limitations.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the RAP model to enable adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos, overcoming major limitations of previous fixed-length models. The other contributions support achieving this overall goal.

The paper introduces a new framework called "Retrieval-Augmented Planner (RAP)" for adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos, where the procedure length is not fixed or predetermined. Key aspects of this framework include the ability to generate variable length plans, the use of retrieval augmentation to refine plans, and a weakly supervised training approach to utilize unannotated videos. The edit score metric is also introduced to better evaluate variable length procedure plans. Overall, the key focus is on improving procedure planning in instructional videos by handling varying sequence lengths and leveraging different forms of available data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new setting called "adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos." How is this setting different from previous settings for procedure planning, and why is it more realistic and practical?

2. The Retrieval-Augmented Planner (RAP) model consists of two key components: a base planner and a retrieval planner. Explain the role and functionality of each of these components in detail. 

3. The base planner in RAP utilizes an auto-regressive Transformer model. Why is this type of model well-suited for the adaptive procedure planning task? Discuss the benefits it provides.

4. Explain how the retrieval augmentation mechanism in RAP allows the model to exploit temporal dependencies between action steps using the training data. What specific information does it retrieve to help with action prediction?

5. The paper proposes a novel weakly-supervised training approach using unannotated videos. Explain how pseudo-annotations are generated from the unannotated videos and how these are incorporated into the RAP training process. 

6. What modifications were made to the training procedure of RAP to accommodate the addition of unannotated video data? Discuss the two training stages in detail.

7. The paper introduces a new evaluation metric called the "mean edit score." Explain what this metric measures and why it is better suited for evaluating variable length procedure predictions compared to prior metrics.

8. Analyze and discuss the ablation studies conducted in the paper. What do they reveal about the contribution of different components of the RAP model to its overall performance?

9. Examine the sample predictions shown in the paper. Discuss some common reasons why RAP's predictions may diverge from the ground truth procedures. 

10. How could the proposed RAP model and weakly-supervised training framework be extended or improved upon in future work? Discuss 2-3 potential ideas or enhancements.
