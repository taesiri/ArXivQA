# [AGIEval: A Human-Centric Benchmark for Evaluating Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a more meaningful and robust evaluation benchmark to assess the general capabilities of large foundation models on human-level cognitive tasks?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Traditional benchmarks that rely on artificial datasets may not accurately represent the complexity of human-level tasks and real-world cognition. 2) Evaluating foundation models on human-centric standardized exams (e.g. college entrance exams, professional qualification tests) that are intended for general test-takers will provide a more robust assessment of their capabilities on tasks directly relevant to human reasoning and decision-making.3) A bilingual benchmark incorporating both English and Chinese will enable a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance across languages and cultures. 4) Analyzing model capabilities across dimensions like understanding, knowledge, reasoning and calculation will provide valuable insights into their strengths and limitations on human-centric tasks.5) State-of-the-art foundation models like GPT-3 will demonstrate strong but not yet human-level performance on this more rigorous human-centric benchmark.In summary, the central hypothesis is that evaluating foundation models on standardized human exams will more meaningfully assess their general capabilities on tasks pertinent to real-world human cognition and problem-solving. The multi-dimensional analysis aims to provide insights to guide future model development.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here is how I see this paper comparing to other related work:Overall Focus: This paper introduces a new human-centric benchmark called AGIEval for evaluating the general capabilities of foundation models on tasks relevant to human cognition and problem solving. The key contribution is the creation of this new benchmark derived from standardized tests and exams designed for human test takers. In this regard, it differs from most existing benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, etc. which rely on artificial datasets to assess specific machine skills. Other human-centric benchmarks like MMLU also collect data from online sources but the source and coverage is less standardized compared to standardized tests. So the paper's focus on standardized human tests helps better assess language models in a more meaningful way.Technical Approach: The paper conducts an extensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, Text-Davinci on the new benchmark under varied settings like zero-shot, few-shot etc. The unique aspect is the inclusion of Chain-of-Thought prompting to assess reasoning.Other model evaluation papers like ToxiGen, BOLD etc. focus on specific issues like bias. Works like Liang et al. cover fewer models. So this paper provides a more comprehensive analysis of the latest models using rigorous human-centric tests.Insights: Key insights include the superior performance of GPT-4, comparison between ChatGPT and Text-Davinci-003, challenges in complex reasoning tasks, small gains from few-shot learning, and the qualitative analysis of model strengths and limitations.These insights align with and expand on similar observations about model capabilities and limitations mentioned in other analysis papers. But the standardized benchmark provides more credible insights.In summary, the paper pushes forward human-centric evaluation of language models in a rigorous manner, providing novel technical contributions, extensive empirical analysis and actionable insights. The benchmark and analysis meaningfully advances research on assessing model capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:1. Inclusion of External Knowledge and Formulas: The authors suggest enriching large language models with external knowledge sources like formulas and domain-specific knowledge to enhance their performance on mathematical and knowledge-intensive tasks. This could involve integrating structured knowledge repositories and mathematical/scientific concepts into models via pre-training or knowledge-enhanced prompting. 2. Improving Complex Logical Reasoning: The authors highlight the need to improve models' capabilities for strict, complex logical reasoning which is crucial for many human-centric tasks. Potential approaches include creating new complex reasoning datasets and incorporating symbolic reasoning compilers to aid in logical analysis and verification.3. Enhancing Multilingual Reasoning Generalization: The authors note reasoning abilities vary across languages and emphasize enhancing multilingual generalization of reasoning skills for broader applicability.4. Expanding to Multi-Modal Evaluation: The authors propose expanding the evaluation framework to include multi-modal tasks with visual, auditory or interactive inputs/outputs for more comprehensive assessment.5. Developing Better Automatic Evaluation Metrics: The authors highlight the need for more robust, meaningful automatic evaluation metrics that accurately capture models' reasoning abilities for human-centric tasks. 6. Improving Reasoning Robustness: The authors suggest techniques to improve the robustness and consistency of models' reasoning capabilities across different contexts.In summary, the key directions focus on expanding knowledge and reasoning capabilities, enhancing multilingual skills, incorporating multi-modal evaluation, and developing better benchmark metrics and training procedures to improve reasoning robustness. The authors aim to drive progress in developing more human-like foundation models.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces a new benchmark called AGIEval that is designed to evaluate the general capabilities of foundation models on human-level tasks. The benchmark is constructed using questions from various high-quality, official exams intended for human test-takers, including college entrance exams, law school admission tests, math competitions, lawyer qualification tests, and civil service exams. These types of tests establish officially recognized standards for assessing human cognitive abilities. The benchmark covers 20 different tasks across a diverse range of subjects in both English and Chinese.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem or question being addressed is:How to effectively evaluate the general reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large foundation models, such as large language models, on complex human-centric tasks that require advanced cognition and decision making abilities. The paper argues that existing benchmarks used for evaluating these large foundation models often rely on artificial datasets and tasks that do not accurately represent the complexity of real-world human cognition and reasoning. As a result, the current benchmarks provide limited insights into how these models would perform on more realistic human-level tasks.To address this gap, the paper introduces a new benchmark called AGIEval that is specifically designed to assess foundation models on tasks derived from standardized human exams and qualifications tests, such as college admission exams, law school admission tests, and professional licensing exams. The goal is to provide a more meaningful evaluation of whether these large language models can exhibit human-level performance on tests intended to gauge general human cognitive abilities and subject matter knowledge. By concentrating on official exams designed for human test-takers, AGIEval aims to deliver a more robust assessment of how these models align with human-level intelligence and their readiness to take on real-world reasoning challenges.In summary, the key problem is creating a benchmark that can better evaluate the general reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models on complex tasks that more closely mimic real human cognition, rather than just performance on artificial datasets. AGIEval attempts to provide such an assessment using standardized human exams as a more accurate proxy for human reasoning skills.
