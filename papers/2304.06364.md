# [AGIEval: A Human-Centric Benchmark for Evaluating Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a more meaningful and robust evaluation benchmark to assess the general capabilities of large foundation models on human-level cognitive tasks?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Traditional benchmarks that rely on artificial datasets may not accurately represent the complexity of human-level tasks and real-world cognition. 

2) Evaluating foundation models on human-centric standardized exams (e.g. college entrance exams, professional qualification tests) that are intended for general test-takers will provide a more robust assessment of their capabilities on tasks directly relevant to human reasoning and decision-making.

3) A bilingual benchmark incorporating both English and Chinese will enable a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance across languages and cultures. 

4) Analyzing model capabilities across dimensions like understanding, knowledge, reasoning and calculation will provide valuable insights into their strengths and limitations on human-centric tasks.

5) State-of-the-art foundation models like GPT-3 will demonstrate strong but not yet human-level performance on this more rigorous human-centric benchmark.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that evaluating foundation models on standardized human exams will more meaningfully assess their general capabilities on tasks pertinent to real-world human cognition and problem-solving. The multi-dimensional analysis aims to provide insights to guide future model development.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem or question being addressed is:

How to effectively evaluate the general reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large foundation models, such as large language models, on complex human-centric tasks that require advanced cognition and decision making abilities. 

The paper argues that existing benchmarks used for evaluating these large foundation models often rely on artificial datasets and tasks that do not accurately represent the complexity of real-world human cognition and reasoning. As a result, the current benchmarks provide limited insights into how these models would perform on more realistic human-level tasks.

To address this gap, the paper introduces a new benchmark called AGIEval that is specifically designed to assess foundation models on tasks derived from standardized human exams and qualifications tests, such as college admission exams, law school admission tests, and professional licensing exams. 

The goal is to provide a more meaningful evaluation of whether these large language models can exhibit human-level performance on tests intended to gauge general human cognitive abilities and subject matter knowledge. By concentrating on official exams designed for human test-takers, AGIEval aims to deliver a more robust assessment of how these models align with human-level intelligence and their readiness to take on real-world reasoning challenges.

In summary, the key problem is creating a benchmark that can better evaluate the general reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models on complex tasks that more closely mimic real human cognition, rather than just performance on artificial datasets. AGIEval attempts to provide such an assessment using standardized human exams as a more accurate proxy for human reasoning skills.
