# [Deployable Reinforcement Learning with Variable Control Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09286)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) relies on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption which assumes a discrete passage of time and a fixed control rate. This can be problematic when deploying RL policies on robots with limited computing resources. 
- Using a high, fixed control rate to ensure stability and controllability demands significant computational resources and energy. This hinders deployability of RL controllers on robots.
- RL does not typically consider the temporal aspect such as duration of actions. This can lead to suboptimal performance when deployed in the real world.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose reinforcement learning with a variable control rate where the policy outputs both the action to take and the duration of the next time step. 
- This allows adaptive control based on the dynamic demands of the task, saving computational resources and energy. It follows reactive programming principles to only apply control when necessary.
- They introduce the Soft Elastic Actor Critic (SEAC) algorithm which optimizes a multi-objective reward function considering: 1) task objective 2) energy consumption and 3) time to completion.

Contributions:
- First RL algorithm to simultaneously output actions and the duration of the subsequent time step, enabling variable rate control.
- Energy-aware reward policy that optimizes for energy efficiency along with task performance.
- Proof-of-concept demonstration of SEAC in a simulation environment with Newtonian physics. SEAC showed better average returns, reduced average task completion times, and lower energy consumption compared to fixed rate RL algorithms.

In summary, the paper proposes a more deployable RL approach for robotics that adapts the control rate based on need. This saves energy and computing resources for other tasks while still effectively completing objectives. The SEAC algorithm and multi-objective reward formulation enable energy-efficient, variable control rate RL.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a variable control rate reinforcement learning method called Soft Elastic Actor-Critic (SEAC) that allows the agent to determine the duration of each time step, aiming to reduce energy consumption and improve sample efficiency compared to fixed control rate RL algorithms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a variant of reinforcement learning with variable control rate, where the policy decides not only the action the agent should take but also the duration of the time step associated with that action. Specifically, the paper:

1) Introduces the concept of variable control rate in reinforcement learning to reduce energy consumption and increase sample efficiency. This is beneficial for robotics applications with limited onboard compute resources. 

2) Proposes a reward policy that incorporates the agent's energy consumption and time to complete tasks, in addition to the main task reward.

3) Extends the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to compute the optimal policy with variable control rate, introducing the Soft Elastic Actor-Critic (SEAC) algorithm. 

4) Verifies the efficacy of SEAC through simulations in a proof-of-concept environment with Newtonian kinematics. The experiments show SEAC achieves higher returns, shorter task completion times, and reduced computational resources compared to fixed rate policies.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and experimentally validating a novel reinforcement learning approach with variable control rate that is more efficient and suitable for deployment on resource-constrained robots.
