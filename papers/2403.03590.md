# [DeepEclipse: How to Break White-Box DNN-Watermarking Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03590)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become crucial assets for AI companies. However, there is a growing threat of model embezzlement and unauthorized usage. 
- Different watermarking techniques have been proposed to protect DNN intellectual property. This has created a competitive field between DNN watermarking and removal methods.
- Existing attacks on white-box watermarking schemes typically require knowledge of the specific watermarking scheme used or access to underlying data for retraining/fine-tuning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel framework called \ourname for removing white-box watermarks from DNNs.
- Two obfuscation techniques are introduced - basic and advanced:
  - Basic attack targets passive verifiers that follow standard protocols. It involves layer splitting and reshaping to alter model structure.
  - Advanced attack addresses active verifiers with access to full models. It first uses frequency analysis to identify potentially watermarked layers. Then it applies noise to make those layers noisy while minimizing impact on model accuracy.
- The techniques work for DNNs with linear and convolutional layers without needing prior knowledge of specific watermarking scheme, extra data or retraining.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of a unified white-box watermark obfuscation framework \ourname with two tailored obfuscation attacks for different adversarial settings.
- Introduction of a frequency analysis method to detect potentially watermarked layers to minimize utility loss.
- Extensive evaluations showing the framework effectively breaks multiple white-box watermarking schemes, reducing watermark detection to random guessing levels while maintaining model accuracy.
- Analysis of framework applicability across model architectures and datasets indicating no accuracy loss from basic obfuscation and minimal loss from advanced obfuscation.

In summary, the paper presents a novel DNN watermark removal framework with obfuscation techniques that can evade watermark detection without needing extra information or resources. Evaluations demonstrate it can effectively neutralize white-box watermarks while preserving model utility.
