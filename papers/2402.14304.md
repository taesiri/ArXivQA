 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Vision-Language Navigation with Embodied Intelligence: A Survey":

Problem:
Vision-language navigation (VLN) is an important research direction within embodied intelligence that aims to enable agents to navigate in environments by understanding natural language instructions and interpreting visual information. Despite advances, VLN faces challenges in effectively integrating multimodal information, limited training data, insufficient generalization capability, and differences between simulated and real-world environments.

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the research progress and future prospects of VLN towards achieving embodied intelligence. It introduces the background technologies like computer vision and natural language processing that provide a foundation for VLN. The paper systematically reviews VLN agents categorized as representation learning-based, decision/policy learning-based, task-oriented, and data-driven. It also analyzes mainstream VLN datasets and benchmarks in detail, highlighting task characteristics and information interaction types. Comparative analyses of state-of-the-art methods on popular VLN datasets are provided.

Main Contributions:
- Thoroughly examines the role of VLN in embodied intelligence and its emergence as a distinct research direction in multimodal AI
- Comprehensively surveys VLN methods and categorizes them into four types based on their core strategies
- Introduces VLN datasets and benchmarks, classifying them by communication complexity and task objectives
- Quantitatively compares performance of VLN methods on widely-used datasets using multiple evaluation metrics  
- Analyzes limitations of current VLN research, especially in transferring from simulation to real-world
- Discusses future perspectives of VLN research, including trends in knowledge integration, real-world application, multilingual data, cognitive architectures, and human-robot collaboration

Overall, this paper offers researchers and practitioners an in-depth understanding of the VLN landscape within embodied intelligence, highlighting current progress and future opportunities. The taxonomy of VLN agents, datasets, and quantitative benchmarking provide valuable insights to advance VLN research towards more capable and generalizable multimodal navigation systems.
