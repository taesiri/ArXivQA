# [Answer is All You Need: Instruction-following Text Embedding via   Answering the Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text embedding models fail to capture user-specific characteristics of text as required in applications like personalized search and clustering. They lack instruction-following capabilities.

Proposed Solution: 
- Treat the user instruction as a question about the input text and encode the expected answers to obtain an instruction-following representation. Texts with the same semantics should have similar answer distributions.  
- Propose InBedder framework that fine-tunes language models on abstractive QA datasets to answer user questions/instructions given text inputs. This results in concise and informative answers.
- Show InBedder outperforms sentence transformers and aggregated LM embeddings on proposed instruction-awareness and robustness tests.

Main Contributions:
- Formulate the novel problem of instruction-following for text embeddings.
- Propose the InBedder model and a training methodology using QA datasets. 
- Introduce new tasks for evaluating instruction-following capabilities.
- Demonstrate improved performance over baselines on awareness and robustness tests.
- Show the framework leads to interpretable clusters and embedding explanations can be extracted from the QA generations.

In summary, the paper identifies limitations of existing embedders in capturing user-specific text characteristics and proposes the InBedder model to address this by learning to generate concise answers conditioned on user instructions/questions. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes InBedder, a method to produce instruction-following text embeddings by fine-tuning language models on question-answering datasets and using the expected answer representations as embeddings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework called InBedder for generating instruction-following text embeddings. Specifically, it treats the user instruction as a question about the input text and encodes the expected answers from a language model to obtain representations that capture semantics specified by the instruction. The key ideas include:

1) Observing that hidden states corresponding to generated answers in instruction-tuned LLMs are more instruction-aware compared to those from prompts. 

2) Proposing to fine-tune LLMs on abstractive QA datasets to produce concise and informative answers for embedding.

3) Introducing new tasks for evaluating instruction-following capabilities of embeddings like instruction-based sentence similarity and robustness tests.

4) Demonstrating InBedder generates high-quality instruction-aware embeddings and outperforms previous methods across various model sizes from RoBERTa to LLama.

5) Showing the embeddings from InBedder enable interpreting clusters via mining explanations from the generations.

The paper proposes a new framework called "InBedder" to produce instruction-following text embeddings by treating user instructions as questions and encoding the expected answers. It introduces new tasks to evaluate instruction awareness and robustness. The method also allows for interpreting embedding clusters by mining explanations from the model's generations. Overall, the key focus is on developing text embeddings that can capture user-specified characteristics per their instructions, with evaluations on the model's instruction following capabilities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that treating instructions as questions and encoding the expected answers is an effective approach for instruction-following text embedding. What is the theoretical justification behind this hypothesis? How might encoding expected answers help capture text characteristics specified in the instruction?

2. The paper fine-tunes language models on a collection of 11 abstractive QA datasets with around 200,000 examples. What properties of these datasets make them suitable for learning instruction-following embeddings? Why choose abstractive over extractive QA?  

3. The fine-tuned model, InBedder, is shown to outperform baselines on proposed instruction-awareness and robustness tests. What specific abilities do you think these tests capture that allows InBedder to demonstrate superiority?  

4. For the larger LM models, the paper surprisingly finds that using the hidden states for only the first generated token works the best. Why might the first token's states be most informative in this setting? How is the training objective promoting this?

5. Aside from performance, the paper argues InBedder has an interpretability advantage owing to its training process. How exactly does the QA fine-tuning lend itself to producing interpretable embeddings and explanations for clusters?

6. The paper studies using both the prompt hidden states and the generation/answer hidden states as embeddings. What might be the tradeoffs between these two encoding strategies? When might one be preferred over the other?

7. The paper preprocesses the abstractive QA training data to remove stopwords from answers. What effect does this have and why is it beneficial for learning concise, instruction-following embeddings? 

8. For efficiency, could an extractive QA objective also work well here? What advantages or disadvantages might that have compared to abstractive QA?

9. How suitable do you think the proposed evaluation tasks are for assessing instruction awareness and robustness? What other complementary metrics could reveal model capabilities? 

10. The method relies on fine-tuning large, pretrained LMs. How do you think the approach would fare if applied to smaller LMs? Would the performance trends and conclusions still hold?
