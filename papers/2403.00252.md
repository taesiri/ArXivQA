# [EUROPA: A Legal Multilingual Keyphrase Generation Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Keyphrase generation (KPG) has been primarily studied for English academic/STEM documents, lacking research into other languages and domains like law. 
- No open benchmark exists for multilingual legal keyphrase generation, making progress difficult.
- Long input documents are challenging for existing KPG methods limited to 1,024 tokens.
- Evaluation metrics may overestimate performance due to exact matching and ignore relevant keyphrases.

Proposed Solution:
- Present Europa, the first open multilingual dataset for legal keyphrase generation, with over 280k instances spanning 24 EU languages.
- Data is derived from legal judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). 
- Implement a version of mBART using long-range self-attention to handle input lengths up to 8,192 tokens.
- Evaluate models using standard automatic metrics like F1 as well as newly proposed semantic matching.

Main Contributions:
- Release the first open multilingual corpus for legal keyphrase generation
- Provide detailed analysis highlighting domain-specific aspects and statistics
- Establish performance benchmarks using common multilingual models 
- Show benefits of increasing input context length from 1k to 8k tokens
- Reveal limitations around long keyphrase generation and low-resource languages
- Suggest enhancements like semantic matching to better evaluate model quality

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in introducing this new dataset to drive further progress in multilingual and domain-specific keyphrase generation, while analyzing model performance and areas needing improvement.
