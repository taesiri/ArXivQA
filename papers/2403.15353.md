# [Fully automated workflow for the design of patient-specific orthopaedic   implants: application to total knee arthroplasty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Osteoarthritis affects over 500 million people worldwide, causing pain and reduced mobility. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is commonly performed to treat severe osteoarthritis. While TKA has improved over time, 5-15% of patients are still unsatisfied after surgery, mainly due to issues with implant fit, biomechanics, stability, and longevity. The number of TKA procedures is increasing rapidly, presenting a growing burden on healthcare systems. Personalized TKA can improve outcomes but current solutions requiring manual design are too time consuming for routine clinical use.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose the first fully automated workflow to design patient-specific TKA implants directly from CT images in about 5 minutes. The workflow involves:

1) Automated segmentation of the hip, knee and ankle joints using convolutional neural networks.

2) Reconstruction of full 3D bone models by fitting statistical shape models to the segmented extremities and incorporating anatomical landmark information.  

3) Computation of 77 anatomical parameters to characterize the patient's morphology.

4) Automated design of custom femoral, tibial, and polyethylene inserts based on medial pivot concept to provide optimal fit and kinematics.

Main Contributions:

- End-to-end planning workflow with no manual intervention, allowing integration in clinical routine

- Fast computation time under 5 minutes from segmentation to implant design 

- High accuracy in segmentation (0.4mm), landmarks (<3mm), and implant fit to bone (0.6mm)

- Restoration of patient-specific joint alignment and anatomy with implants

- Potential to answer growing demand for TKA procedures and improve patient outcomes

The proposed workflow enables truly personalized TKA for patients needing imminent surgery by eliminating the time-consuming manual design process. Combined with efficient manufacturing techniques, it could transform TKA therapy.
