# [StableQ: Enhancing Data-Scarce Quantization with Text-to-Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Quantizing deep neural networks to low-bit representations enables efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices, but often requires finetuning on the original training data to maintain accuracy. However, access to such training data is frequently restricted due to privacy or intellectual property concerns. This gives rise to the problem of "data-scarce quantization".

Existing Approaches & Limitations: 
Prior works tackle this using methods like inverting images via optimization and jointly training generative models to synthesize input samples. However, these methods struggle to accurately recreate complex real-world objects, especially for large-scale datasets like ImageNet.

Proposed Solution - StableQ:
This paper introduces StableQ, a novel pipeline leveraging state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion to generate high-quality, realistic synthetic images for data-scarce quantization.

To reduce distribution gap between synthetic and real images, StableQ employs two filtering mechanisms - Energy Score filter and BatchNorm Sensitivity filter - to select synthetic images closely matching the actual training data characteristics.

In few-shot cases where limited training data is available, StableQ guides synthetic image generation by "prompt tuning" - optimizing a learnable text embedding to align content with the available real images.

Main Contributions:

1) First work using advanced text-to-image models for data-scarce quantization 

2) Innovative filtering mechanisms and prompt tuning method to reduce distribution gap between synthetic and real data

3) Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art quantization performance with StableQ for both Post-Training Quantization and Quantization-Aware Training, using various network architectures and in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

In summary, StableQ pushes forward the state-of-the-art in generating high-quality synthetic data for quantization and sets a new benchmark for data-scarce model compression techniques.
