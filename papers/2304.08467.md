# [Learning to Compress Prompts with Gist Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08467)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a method called "gisting" to compress natural language prompts into smaller sets of "gist tokens" in order to improve the efficiency of large language models. The key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can an LM be trained to compress arbitrary prompts into gist tokens in a way that preserves the semantics/function of the original prompt? 

2) Will using these compressed gist tokens instead of the full prompts improve computational efficiency (FLOPs, latency, storage) during inference?

3) Can this "gisting" capability generalize to compressing novel, unseen prompts at test time without additional training?

The core hypothesis seems to be that an LM can learn to compress prompts in a generalizable way, and that using these compressed gist tokens can lead to efficiency gains during inference without substantially degrading output quality. The paper aims to demonstrate these capabilities and efficiency improvements empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a method called "gisting" to compress prompts for language models in order to improve efficiency. The key ideas are:

- Gisting trains a language model to compress prompts into smaller "gist" tokens. This allows caching and reusing the gist tokens instead of repeatedly encoding long prompts.

- Gisting models can be trained with no additional cost on top of standard instruction finetuning, simply by modifying the Transformer attention mask to encourage prompt compression into the gist tokens. 

- Experiments on LLaMA and T5 models show gisting can compress prompts up to 26x with minimal loss in output quality. This enables up to 40% FLOPs reduction and modest latency improvements.

- Gisting generalizes to compress novel, unseen prompts at test time without additional training. This avoids having to do costlier strategies like finetuning or distillation for every new prompt.

- The paper frames gisting as both a form of instruction tuning and context distillation. The gist tokens can be seen as a prompt or "context" that captures the essential information from the full prompt.

Overall, the main contribution is introducing gisting as an efficient prompting strategy that leverages the language model itself to compress prompts on the fly. The simple masking approach allows gisting models to be trained without any additional cost.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on prompt compression and efficient language modeling:

- Overall, the idea of learning to compress prompts into "gist tokens" for efficiency is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on methods like finetuning/distillation to adapt LMs to tasks without prompting, caching prompt activations, or modifying attention for better memory. Gisting offers an alternative that doesn't require per-task training and can generalize to new prompts.

- The proposed method for learning gisting through instruction tuning and attention masking is simple and elegant. It builds nicely off of instruction tuning methods like Touchdown and avoids complex losses or architectures others have used for compression. The ability to get compression "for free" during finetuning is powerful.

- The results demonstrating large prompt compression rates (26x), 40% FLOPs savings, and minimal quality degradation are quite strong, especially on decoder models like LLaMA. Most prior work on efficient prompting has not achieved such high compression rates with as little quality loss.

- The generalization results are notable - the fact that gist models maintain decent performance even on OOD prompts is promising and sets this apart from approaches that would compress prompts in a more task-specific way.

- The failures on certain detailed instructions point to some limitations around capturing nuance. And the constraints introduced on encoder-decoder models like T5 require more investigation. But the overall results seem very solid.

- Compared to concurrent work from Wingate et al. on soft prompt tuning, this paper explores similar ideas from a refreshing perspective of meta-learning and compression, rather than just tuning a single prompt.

Overall, I'd say this is a nicely done paper presenting a simple but effective new technique for prompt compression and efficient prompting. The results look competitive or better than related recent work in this quickly growing field. The idea of gisting to amortize prompt compression is clever, and the proposed methods are intuitively motivated.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring gist masking and pretraining for encoder-decoder models like T5. The authors found slightly worse performance with gisting for FLAN-T5 compared to the decoder-only LLaMA model. They hypothesize this may be due to gist masking disrupting the typical bidirectional attention flow in the encoder. Pretraining objectives that learn to compress arbitrary spans of text could help improve encoder-decoder gisting.

- Applying gisting to very long prompts that exceed the context window, for example multi-shot prompts with many examples. The compression rates shown in the paper are measured on fairly short prompts from the datasets used. Much higher compression rates are likely possible for longer prompts.

- Retrofitting gisting to existing frozen LMs, by training a smaller model to predict the gist tokens for a larger model, rather than fine-tuning the large model itself. This could make it easier to apply gisting to models where finetuning is difficult.

- Improving sampling techniques during gist training to address some failure cases like repetitive and runaway generations that were observed.

- Evaluating the impact of gisting on very large-scale systems deployed in production, where even minor improvements in efficiency can have substantial cost savings over time.

- Considering privacy implications of gisting and prompt caching, since the gist tokens likely encode sensitive information about the original prompts.

Overall, the authors propose several interesting ways to extend gisting and apply it in broader contexts beyond what was studied in the initial paper. Testing gisting in large real-world systems seems like a particularly important next step.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents gisting, a method to compress prompts into "gist tokens" in order to improve the efficiency of large language models like ChatGPT during inference. Gisting trains a model to predict a small set of virtual "gist" tokens that compress the information in arbitrary prompts, allowing the gist tokens to be cached and reused to avoid repeatedly encoding the full prompt. The authors propose a simple way to learn gisting by doing instruction tuning and modifying the Transformer attention masks to encourage compression into the gist tokens, with no additional training cost. Experiments on the 7B parameter LLaMA decoder model and 11B parameter FLAN encoder-decoder model demonstrate that gisting can compress prompts up to 26x with minimal loss in output quality. This enables computational savings of up to 40% FLOPs reduction and 4.2% wall time speedup during inference, as well as greatly reduced storage costs compared to caching full prompts. The results demonstrate the promise of gisting for improving efficiency of large language models deployed at scale.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Unfortunately without reading the full paper, it is difficult to provide an accurate 1-sentence summary. However, based on skimming the formatting and section titles, it seems to be about using "gist tokens" to compress prompts for large language models to improve efficiency. A very rough 1-sentence summary could be: "The paper proposes a method to compress prompts for large language models into 'gist tokens' to improve computational and memory efficiency." However, I would caution that this is just a guess without fully reading and comprehending the paper. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt a more thorough summary after reviewing the full content.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called "gisting" to compress prompts for language models (LMs) into smaller "gist tokens", improving efficiency while retaining output quality. Gisting trains an LM to compress an instructional prompt into a small set of gist tokens that capture the "gist" of the prompt. At test time, the gist tokens can be cached and reused to avoid repeatedly encoding long prompts. 

The key idea is to modify the Transformer self-attention mask during instruction finetuning to prevent tokens after the gist tokens from attending to tokens before. This forces the model to compress the prompt into the gist tokens. Experiments on decoder LMs like LLaMA and encoder-decoder LMs like T5 show gisting can compress prompts up to 26x with minimal loss in output quality. Gisting enables 40% FLOPs reductions and faster inference compared to no caching. While gains over full prompt caching are smaller, gisting allows caching 26x more prompts with the same memory. Limitations include some loss of nuance and prompts with specific details. Overall, gisting is a simple but promising approach for improving efficiency of prompted LMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called "gisting" to compress prompts for language models. The key idea is to train the language model itself to compress prompts into smaller "gist tokens", allowing the model to generalize to compressing new prompts at test time without additional training. This is achieved by simply doing standard instruction tuning on the model, but modifying the Transformer self-attention mask during training. Specifically, gist tokens are inserted after the prompt, and the mask is altered so that tokens after the gist tokens cannot attend to tokens before the gist tokens. This forces the model to compress information about the prompt into the gist tokens. The resulting "gist model" can then be used to predict gist tokens for new prompts to reduce prompt lengths and improve efficiency, without degrading output quality. Experiments on LLaMA and FLAN-T5 show the method can compress prompts up to 26x while maintaining strong performance on unseen instructions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the problem of computational efficiency and prompt storage costs when using large language models that require prompting with natural language instructions. Specifically, it discusses how repeatedly encoding the same prompt is inefficient, and that caching prompt activations can help but still incurs storage costs as the number of prompts grows. 

The key question seems to be: how can we reduce the computational and storage costs associated with prompting large language models, while still retaining the flexibility of prompting and without needing to finetune a separate model for each task?

To address this, the paper proposes "gisting", a method to train language models to compress prompts into smaller sets of "gist tokens" that can be cached and reused. This allows arbitrary unseen prompts to be compressed at test time without additional training.

So in summary, the paper is tackling the problem of prompt efficiency and reuse in large pretrained language models, and proposing gisting as a way to amortize the cost of prompting across many tasks by compressing prompts into reusable gist tokens.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper "Learning to Compress Prompts with Gist Tokens":

This paper proposes a method called "gisting" to compress prompts into smaller "gist tokens" that can be reused to make language model inference more efficient. Gisting trains a model to predict a small set of gist tokens from a prompt, allowing the activations of the gist tokens to be cached instead of repeatedly encoding the full prompt. The authors show a simple way to implement gisting by modifying Transformer attention masks during instruction tuning, forcing the model to compress the prompt into subsequent gist tokens. Experiments on LLaMA and T5 models demonstrate that gisting achieves high compression rates of up to 26x, reduces FLOPs by up to 40%, and speeds up inference by 4.2%, with minimal loss in output quality compared to uncompressed models. The compressed gist tokens enable substantial compute and storage savings while retaining the capabilities of the original uncompressed model.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 detailed questions about the gisting method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper claims that gisting allows for generalization to novel unseen tasks without any additional training. However, the gisting model still requires some amount of training on a variety of tasks. How much data is required to train a gisting model that can generalize well? Is there a theoretical limit on how much the model can generalize?

2. The authors use a simple method of gist masking to encourage the model to compress prompts into gist tokens. Are there any other, potentially more sophisticated methods that could lead to better compression rates or preservation of semantics? For example, could we incorporate discrete autoencoders or VAEs? 

3. The authors evaluate gisting models on a variety of metrics including human evaluations. What other metrics could supplement these evaluations to better understand the tradeoffs of gisting models? For example, could we evaluate on targeted adversarial examples?

4. The results show gisting works well for decoder-only models like LLaMA but slightly worse for encoder-decoder models like T5. What architectural differences make gisting more challenging for encoder-decoder models? How could we modify the approach for better performance on them?

5. The authors claim gisting allows caching more prompts in the same storage budget. But how do gisting models perform when allowed longer context windows to fit uncompressed prompts? Could that be a better solution?

6. The paper focuses on self-contained prompts, but how would gisting interact with approaches that expand prompts over multiple turns? Does compressing turns independently hurt conversation coherence? 

7. The authors use a single gist token, but results are inconsistent on whether more gist tokens help. Is there a principled way to determine the optimal number of gist tokens for a given model and prompt distribution?

8. How robust is gisting to adversarial prompts designed to “break” the gisting model? Are certain types or components of prompts more susceptible to being mishandled?

9. The paper studies gisting by modifying attention masks, but are there other ways we could encourage prompt compression that may work better? For example, using different loss functions during finetuning.

10. The authors finetune the full model, but could we get better generalization by only training the gisting components? For example, just the gist token embeddings/projections.
