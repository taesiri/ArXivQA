# [BDIQA: A New Dataset for Video Question Answering to Explore Cognitive   Reasoning through Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Theory of mind (ToM) reasoning is important for advancing AI's cognitive abilities and interaction with humans, but current video question answering (VideoQA) datasets do not focus on exploring ToM reasoning.  
- Existing machine ToM research also has limitations in the dataset formats (simple 2D grids) and tasks (lack of joint reasoning on beliefs, desires, intentions).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces BDIQA, a new VideoQA benchmark to assess models' ToM reasoning abilities related to beliefs, desires and intentions (BDI).
- BDIQA has a two-level structure inspired by stages of children's ToM development, with simple tasks at level 0 and more complex ones at level 1. 
- The videos involve two characters performing household activities. Questions ask about the characters' BDI states to understand their actions.
- The paper evaluates various VideoQA methods on BDIQA under zero-shot, few-shot and supervised settings.

Main Contributions:
- BDIQA benchmark that pioneers assessment of VideoQA models' cognitive reasoning abilities based on theory of mind.
- Two-level dataset structure that facilitates evaluation of different aspects and difficulties of ToM reasoning.
- Analysis of multiple VideoQA methods on BDIQA, providing insights into current limitations and future improvements needed.
- Enhancements to adapt pre-trained models for BDIQA through better video backbone and memory module, with guidelines identified via ablation study.

In summary, the paper presents BDIQA to open up a new direction in evaluating and advancing VideoQA models' cognitive reasoning capacities in relation to theory of mind.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces BDIQA, a new benchmark dataset to assess machine theory of mind capabilities in areas like belief, desire, and intention reasoning across videos, filling gaps in existing machine theory of mind research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors contribute BDIQA, a new benchmark dataset to explore the cognitive reasoning capabilities of video question answering (VideoQA) models in the context of theory of mind (ToM). Specifically, BDIQA assesses models' understanding of belief, desire, and intention (BDI) reasoning at two difficulty levels inspired by children's ToM development. 

2. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments and analysis to evaluate several mainstream VideoQA methods on BDIQA. They provide detailed results on different question types and observations/insights that can guide future research in cognitive VideoQA.

In summary, the key contributions are a new benchmark dataset (BDIQA) to assess machine theory of mind, along with extensive experiments and analysis on this dataset using existing VideoQA models. The work aims to promote research into cognitive reasoning abilities for VideoQA.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Theory of mind (ToM): The paper focuses on exploring the cognitive reasoning capabilities of AI models through the lens of theory of mind, which refers to the ability to attribute mental states like beliefs, desires, and intentions to others. 

- Belief, desire, intention (BDI) reasoning: The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called BDIQA to specifically assess models on BDI reasoning, which are core components of theory of mind.

- Video question answering (VideoQA): The paper situates its work in the broader area of video question answering. BDIQA is presented as a new dataset to bring cognitive reasoning into VideoQA.

- Cognitive reasoning: The overarching goal is to enhance the cognitive reasoning abilities of AI systems. BDIQA allows testing if models can perform belief, desire, and intention reasoning to demonstrate stronger cognition.

- Children's theory of mind: The dataset design and multi-level tasks are inspired by research on the developmental trajectory of theory of mind in children. This biological grounding is meant to facilitate more human-like reasoning.

- Machine theory of mind: The paper contributes to work on developing machine theory of mind, i.e. work on replicating ToM capabilities in AI. The limitations of current machine ToM research motivates the introduction of BDIQA.

In summary, the key focus is on cognitive reasoning, specifically belief, desire, and intention reasoning, in the context of video question answering, with inspirations from theory of mind development in children to advance machine theory of mind.
