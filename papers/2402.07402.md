# [BDIQA: A New Dataset for Video Question Answering to Explore Cognitive   Reasoning through Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Theory of mind (ToM) reasoning is important for advancing AI's cognitive abilities and interaction with humans, but current video question answering (VideoQA) datasets do not focus on exploring ToM reasoning.  
- Existing machine ToM research also has limitations in the dataset formats (simple 2D grids) and tasks (lack of joint reasoning on beliefs, desires, intentions).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces BDIQA, a new VideoQA benchmark to assess models' ToM reasoning abilities related to beliefs, desires and intentions (BDI).
- BDIQA has a two-level structure inspired by stages of children's ToM development, with simple tasks at level 0 and more complex ones at level 1. 
- The videos involve two characters performing household activities. Questions ask about the characters' BDI states to understand their actions.
- The paper evaluates various VideoQA methods on BDIQA under zero-shot, few-shot and supervised settings.

Main Contributions:
- BDIQA benchmark that pioneers assessment of VideoQA models' cognitive reasoning abilities based on theory of mind.
- Two-level dataset structure that facilitates evaluation of different aspects and difficulties of ToM reasoning.
- Analysis of multiple VideoQA methods on BDIQA, providing insights into current limitations and future improvements needed.
- Enhancements to adapt pre-trained models for BDIQA through better video backbone and memory module, with guidelines identified via ablation study.

In summary, the paper presents BDIQA to open up a new direction in evaluating and advancing VideoQA models' cognitive reasoning capacities in relation to theory of mind.
