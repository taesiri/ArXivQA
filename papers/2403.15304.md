# [KTbench: A Novel Data Leakage-Free Framework for Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15304)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Some knowledge tracing (KT) models expand the sequence of question-student interactions into knowledge component (KC)-student interactions. This addresses sparsity issues but can cause two problems:
   1) Data leakage between KCs of the same question during evaluation, leading to misleading accuracy results
   2) Models learning to leak data between KCs of the same question during training, hurting performance
- In addition, benchmarks often compare models with inconsistent sequence lengths.

Proposed Solutions:
- Introduce multiple methods to avoid data leakage:
   - Autoregressive decoding for DKT (DKT-AD)  
   - Adding attention masks for AKT (AKT-QM)
   - Averaging embeddings before passing to model for DKT (DKT-Fuse) 
   - Adding <MASK> labels alongside 0/1 response labels (DKT-ML, AKT-ML)
- Enforce consistent sequence lengths across models for fair benchmarking 

Key Contributions:
- Empirical demonstration of data leakage issue causing performance degradation
- Introduction of data leakage-free framework with several model variations 
- Open source benchmark library (KTbench) ensuring reproducible experiments
- Performance gains over original DKT and AKT models, with AKT-ML being most competitive
- Fair benchmark comparisons by fixing number of questions across test sequences for all models

In summary, the key innovation is a masking framework to avoid data leakage issues in KT models operating on expanded KC sequences. This improves performance while ensuring fair testing, implemented in a new open-source library.
