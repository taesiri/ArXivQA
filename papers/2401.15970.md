# [HEQuant: Marrying Homomorphic Encryption and Quantization for   Communication-Efficient Private Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15970)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing homomorphic encryption (HE) based 2PC frameworks for private DNN inference assume high-precision (e.g. 32-bit) operations and ignore DNNs' robustness to quantization errors. This leads to high communication overhead.

- While naive quantization + HE can reduce communication, gains saturate at very low precision (e.g. below 4 bits) due to limits on HE parameters. 

- Input and output communication costs are imbalanced in HE-based protocols. Prior works only focus on reducing input communication.

Proposed Solution: \method
- A communication-efficient 2PC framework that marries low-precision quantization and optimized HE protocols.

Key Contributions:

1. Quantization-aware HE protocols: Matches HE parameters to reduced bitwidth of quantized DNNs. Achieves >2x latency reduction.

2. Intra-coefficient packing: Packs multiple low-precision activations into one HE coefficient to reduce # of ciphertexts. Enables further communication gains at very low precision. 

3. Quantization-aware tiling: Novel tiling strategy to significantly reduce output communication for linear layers. Considers impact of quantization on HE parameters.

Results:
- On CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet, \method achieves 3.0-23.4x and 3.0-9.3x reduction in communication and latency respectively over state-of-the-art HE-based methods.

- Compared to network optimization methods like pruning and ReLU optimization, \method achieves 3.1-3.6x lower communication with higher accuracy.

In summary, \method is the first work to jointly optimize low-precision quantization and HE protocols to enable highly efficient and accurate private DNN inference. The intra-coefficient packing and quantization-aware tiling are key innovations that unlock substantial gains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes HEQuant, a communication-efficient framework for private inference that combines homomorphic encryption protocols optimized for low-precision quantized neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

1. The authors propose HEQuant, the first 2PC framework that marries low-precision quantization and homomorphic encryption (HE) for efficient private inference.

2. They propose an intra-coefficient packing algorithm and a quantization-aware tiling algorithm to further reduce the communication overhead for low-precision neural networks. 

3. Compared to prior art 2PC frameworks like Cheetah, HEQuant achieves 3.0x communication reduction and 3.9x latency reduction on average. It also outperforms prior network optimization methods like pruning and ReLU-optimized networks, with over 3.1x lower communication while maintaining higher accuracy.

In summary, the key innovation is the joint optimization of low-precision quantization and homomorphic encryption to enable much more efficient secure two-party computation for private neural network inference. The proposed techniques like intra-coefficient packing and quantization-aware tiling help further boost the performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Homomorphic encryption (HE): The paper proposes using HE schemes to enable secure two-party computation for private neural network inference. 

- Quantization: The paper proposes marrying HE with low-precision quantization of neural networks to improve communication efficiency. Key terms like network quantization, low-precision networks, sub-4-bit quantization are discussed.

- Intra-coefficient packing: A proposed method to pack multiple low-precision activations into a single ciphertext coefficient to reduce communication. Two strategies called Within-Channel Packing and Cross-Channel Packing are introduced.

- Quantization-aware tiling: A proposed convolution tiling strategy that considers the impact of network quantization on reducing communication, especially for the output. 

- Communication complexity: The paper analyzes the communication complexity of HE-based frameworks and aims to optimize it.

- Secure two-party computation: The threat model and protocols for secure inference involve two parties - the server with a private model and client with private data.

So in summary, the key terms cover homomorphic encryption, neural network quantization, efficient packing/tiling methods, communication complexity analysis, and secure two-party computation protocols.
