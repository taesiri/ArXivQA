# [TIJO: Trigger Inversion with Joint Optimization for Defending Multimodal   Backdoored Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03906)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we defend against Trojan (backdoor) attacks on multimodal models, specifically for the visual question answering (VQA) task, where the triggers are present in both the visual and textual modalities?

The key hypotheses/claims appear to be:

- Current defense methods designed for unimodal triggers are ineffective against multimodal "dual-key" triggers where the backdoor activates only if triggers are present in both modalities.

- Jointly optimizing and reconstructing triggers in both image and text spaces is necessary for defending against dual-key multimodal backdoor attacks. 

- Reconstructing visual triggers in the feature space of object detectors, rather than pixel space, enables effective joint optimization with text triggers.

- Their proposed defense method TIJO outperforms unimodal defenses against dual-key backdoor attacks on the TrojVQA benchmark.

So in summary, the main research focus is on developing a defense tailored to multimodal models that can handle dual-key backdoor attacks by reconstructing triggers in both modalities via joint optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Introducing a new dual-key backdoor attack for multimodal models, specifically for the visual question answering (VQA) task. In this attack, the backdoor trigger is split across two modalities - image and text. The backdoor only activates when the trigger is present in both modalities.

- Creating a new benchmark dataset called TrojVQA for evaluating backdoor attacks and defenses for VQA models. The dataset contains over 800 VQA models spanning different architectures and object detection backbones, with both clean and backdoored variants.

- Demonstrating successful dual-key backdoor attacks on VQA models from the TrojVQA dataset. The attacks are robust and are able to consistently induce the target misclassification when both the image and text triggers are present.

- Proposing a new defense method called TIJO (Trigger Inversion using Joint Optimization) to detect such dual-key backdoor attacks. TIJO optimizes triggers jointly in both modalities and uses the resulting loss for classifier-based detection.

- Showing through experiments that TIJO significantly outperforms prior unimodal defense methods, improving AUC from 0.6 to 0.92 for detecting dual-key backdoors on TrojVQA models. TIJO also works well for unimodal backdoors.

- Providing ablation studies and analysis to validate the importance of joint optimization and other design choices in TIJO. The method is also able to generate candidate trigger patches matching the ground truth triggers.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing a new challenging dual-key backdoor attack for multimodal VQA models, creating a comprehensive benchmark dataset, and proposing a joint optimization based defense that significantly improves detection over prior arts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new method called Trigger Inversion using Joint Optimization (TIJO) for defending against backdoor attacks on multimodal models. Here are some key points on how it relates to prior research:

- Most prior work on backdoor defense has focused on image classification models. Defense against backdoors in other modalities like text or multimodal models is much less explored. This paper focuses specifically on defending multimodal visual question answering (VQA) models.

- Existing defense methods are generally designed to detect backdoors in a single modality. They are ineffective against dual-key multimodal backdoors where the trigger exists in both text and image. This paper proposes a joint optimization method that can reverse engineer triggers in both modalities.

- Previous trigger inversion defenses like Neural Cleanse and TABOR are designed for image classification models. They don't extend well to multimodal models because of the complex visual pipeline with a separate offline feature extractor. The key insight of this paper is to reconstruct visual triggers in the feature space rather than pixel space.

- The most related prior work is STRIP-ViTA which adapted STRIP to multimodal defense in an online setting. This paper focuses on the more challenging offline setting with no access to labeled data. It also handles dual-key triggers unlike STRIP-ViTA. 

- This is the first defense method evaluated on the TrojVQA benchmark containing over 800 VQA models with single and dual-key backdoors. The proposed TIJO method shows substantial gains over unimodal baselines, improving AUC from 0.6 to 0.92.

In summary, this paper advances multimodal backdoor defense by proposing the first trigger inversion method for multimodal models, and a joint optimization approach tailored to dual-key triggers. The gains over unimodal baselines demonstrate the importance of multimodal defense.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more advanced token selection strategies for NLP trigger inversion. The authors mention exploring gradient-based methods like beam search or nearest neighbors in the embedding space.

- Improving patch generation from inverted feature triggers. The authors note that their current patch generation method had limited success. More research is needed on reliably generating image patches from feature space triggers. 

- Evaluating the robustness of the defense against adaptive attacks where the adversary designs triggers aware of the defense method. 

- Extending the approach to other multimodal tasks beyond VQA, such as multimodal fake news detection.

- Studying the effect of natural trojans in multimodal models, where some benign models exhibit low trigger inversion losses. More analysis is needed to understand this phenomenon.

- Analyzing why the defense does not converge well for certain VQA architectures like BAN models. More research could help the defense generalize across model types.

- Scaling up the defense to larger VQA datasets and more diverse triggers. The current method was demonstrated on a specific VQA dataset with simple triggers.

- Reducing the computational overhead of the defense, for example by more efficient optimization and parallelization.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more advanced token selection strategies for NLP, improving visual trigger inversion, evaluating against adaptive attacks, extending to other tasks, analyzing failure cases, and scaling up the approach. The authors lay out a promising research agenda for advancing defenses against multimodal backdoor attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Trigger Inversion with Joint Optimization (TIJO) for defending against multimodal backdoor attacks on Visual Question Answering (VQA) models. It focuses on dual-key backdoor attacks where the trigger must be present in both the image and text for the attack to succeed. The key insight is to reconstruct the visual trigger in the feature space of the object detector backbone instead of the pixel space, which enables joint optimization with the text trigger. The reconstructed triggers from benign and backdoored models yield different losses, allowing training a classifier to detect backdoored models. Experiments on the TrojVQA benchmark show TIJO substantially outperforms prior unimodal defense methods, improving AUC from 0.6 to 0.92 for detecting dual-key backdoors. Ablation studies provide insights such as the importance of overlaying the reconstructed visual trigger on all feature boxes during optimization.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new method called Trigger Inversion using Joint Optimization (TIJO) for defending against backdoor attacks on multimodal models. Multimodal models, such as for visual question answering (VQA), take inputs from multiple modalities like images and text. Recent work has shown successful backdoor attacks where triggers are introduced in both modalities such that the backdoor activates only when triggers are present in all modalities. Defending against such attacks is challenging for prior defenses designed for unimodal triggers. 

The key idea in TIJO is to jointly optimize and reverse engineer the triggers in both modalities. This is enabled by reconstructing the visual trigger in the feature space of the object detector's outputs rather than the pixel space. Experiments on the TrojVQA benchmark show that TIJO significantly outperforms prior unimodal defense methods, improving AUC from 0.6 to 0.92 for detecting dual-key multimodal backdoors. Ablation studies provide insights such as the importance of overlaying reconstructed feature triggers on all visual features. Overall, TIJO presents an effective defense against multimodal backdoor attacks by reconstructing triggers in both modalities through joint optimization.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Trigger Inversion using Joint Optimization (TIJO) to defend against multimodal backdoor attacks on Visual Question Answering (VQA) models. They introduce a joint optimization approach to reverse engineer the triggers in both the text and image modalities simultaneously. The key insight is to reconstruct the visual trigger in the feature space of the object detector backbone instead of the raw pixel space. This enables effective joint optimization with the text trigger in the embedding space. The reconstructed multimodal triggers are then used as features to train a classifier that can detect whether a given VQA model is backdoored or not in an offline setting. Overall, the joint optimization framework with trigger inversion in the right spaces for each modality enables the method to successfully defend against multimodal backdoor attacks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It introduces a new defense method called TIJO (Trigger Inversion using Joint Optimization) for detecting backdoor attacks in multimodal models, specifically for the visual question answering (VQA) task. 

- Prior work has shown successful backdoor attacks on VQA models using dual-key triggers, where the trigger is present in both image and text modalities. Existing defense methods designed for unimodal triggers fail against such multimodal backdoor attacks. 

- The main challenge is performing joint optimization of triggers in multiple modalities due to the disconnected visual pipeline in VQA models - offline feature extractor fused with text features. 

- TIJO performs joint optimization by reconstructing text triggers in original space and visual triggers in the feature space of detected boxes. This enables consistent convergence and effective detection of multimodal backdoors.

- Evaluation on TrojVQA dataset shows TIJO significantly improves over unimodal defenses, increasing AUC from 0.6 to 0.92 on detecting dual-key backdoors.

- Ablations demonstrate the importance of overlaying reconstructed visual triggers on all feature boxes, and increasing optimization steps. Qualitative results show reconstructed patch triggers.

In summary, the key contribution is a new defense method TIJO that can effectively detect multimodal backdoor attacks in VQA models by reconstructing triggers in both text and visual feature spaces through joint optimization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on a quick skim of the paper, some key terms and concepts that seem important are:

- Backdoor attacks - The paper focuses on detecting backdoor vulnerabilities in neural networks. Backdoor attacks refer to techniques where a model is made to misbehave in specific ways when presented with a particular trigger pattern. 

- Dual-key triggers - The paper deals with a new type of backdoor attack using dual-key triggers, where the backdoor is only activated when triggers are present in both modalities (image and text). This makes detection harder.

- Multimodal models - The models studied are multimodal, meaning they take both visual and textual inputs. The paper focuses on multimodal models for visual question answering (VQA).

- Offline defense - The defense method operates offline, meaning it is given a model and must determine if it contains backdoors, rather than detecting poisoned inputs. 

- Trigger inversion - The core defense approach is based on jointly inverting/reconstructing the triggers in both modalities. This helps identify candidate triggers and models likely to be backdoored.

- Object detection features - A key technical contribution is performing trigger inversion in the object detection feature space rather than pixel space for improved optimization.

- Evaluation on TrojVQA - The method is evaluated on a dataset of clean and backdoored VQA models called TrojVQA, showing improved detection over unimodal defenses.

So in summary, the key focus is on an offline defense against multimodal backdoor attacks using joint trigger inversion, with innovations like inversion in object detection feature space.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel defense technique called TIJO against multimodal backdoor attacks. What are the key challenges in designing a defense against multimodal backdoors compared to unimodal backdoors? How does TIJO address these challenges through its trigger inversion approach?

2. The paper mentions reconstructing visual triggers in the feature space of object detectors instead of pixel space. What is the intuition behind this design choice? What advantages does operating in the feature space provide over pixel space for the task of trigger inversion?

3. The threat model considered in this work assumes the object detector is benign while the backdoor is injected in the VQA model. How would the proposed defense technique need to be modified if the object detector was also potentially compromised or backdoored? 

4. The paper demonstrates TIJO on the TrojVQA dataset containing dual-key backdoor attacks. How do you think the performance of TIJO will generalize to other types of multimodal backdoor attacks beyond dual-key? Are there any attack types you can think of that could potentially evade detection by TIJO?

5. Trigger inversion is performed by optimizing a loss function to reconstruct the trojan triggers. The paper mentions the challenges of joint optimization across modalities due to differing convergence rates. Can you suggest any techniques to potentially improve or stabilize this joint optimization? 

6. Could the idea of trigger inversion be extended to defend against backdoors in other multimodal tasks beyond VQA, such as multimodal machine translation or image captioning? What challenges do you foresee in adapting the approach to other multimodal domains?

7. The paper demonstrates improved performance over unimodal defenses, but there is still room for improvement based on the results. What directions could further boost the detection performance of TIJO on multimodal backdoor attacks?

8. The paper performs trigger inversion in the feature space for computational efficiency. Do you think reconstructing triggers directly in the pixel space could provide any benefits? When might pixel space inversion be preferred?

9. The threat model assumes the object detector is trusted and benign. What are the security concerns if instead the detector was also potentially compromised and contained backdoors? How would this impact the guarantees provided by TIJO?

10. Beyond detection, an important aspect is remediation after identifying a backdoor. What are some ways the reconstructed triggers from TIJO could be leveraged to remove or mitigate the backdoor in the poisoned model?
