# [Variational Inference with Sequential Sample-Average Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09429)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Variational inference (VI) methods are commonly used for approximate Bayesian inference in models with intractable posteriors. However, VI methods like importance-weighted forward KL VI (IWFVI) require many model evaluations, which is computationally expensive for models based on numerical simulations.

Method: 
- The paper proposes variational inference with sequential sample-average approximations (VISA) to reduce the number of model evaluations.

- The key idea is to reuse model evaluations across multiple gradient update steps by constructing deterministic sample-average approximations (SAA) of the variational objective. 

- An SAA fixes samples from the current variational distribution and optimizes the importance-weighted objective deterministically. The samples are refreshed when the effective sample size falls below a threshold, indicating the old samples are no longer representative.

- This leads to an optimization process with a sequence of SAAs, each with a trust region defined by the ESS threshold. New samples are drawn when exiting the trust region.

Contributions:
- Proposes VISA, which adapts IWFVI to use sequential SAAs to reduce computational cost. This is shown to work for non-differentiable models.

- Defines the notion of trust regions based on an ESS threshold to determine when to construct a new SAA.

- Demonstrates computational savings of 2x or more on Gaussian models, Lotka-Volterra dynamics, and a Pickover attractor while maintaining comparable inference quality to IWFVI.

- Discusses limitations related to underestimating posterior variance and scaling to high-dimensional latent spaces.

In summary, the paper develops a method to reduce the computational cost of IWFVI using sequential SAAs, while maintaining inference quality in expensive non-differentiable models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Visa extends importance-weighted forward-KL variational inference by employing a sequence of sample-average approximations to reuse model evaluations across multiple gradient steps, thereby reducing computational cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents "variational inference with sequential sample-average approximations" (VISA), a method for approximate inference in computationally expensive models. The key idea is to reuse model evaluations across multiple gradient steps by employing a sequence of sample-average approximations (SAAs). Specifically:

- VISA adapts importance-weighted forward-KL variational inference to use SAAs, where a fixed set of samples defines a deterministic surrogate objective that is optimized. This avoids generating fresh samples at each gradient step, reducing computational cost.

- To determine when to refresh the SAA, VISA defines a "trust region" based on the effective sample size between the current variational distribution and the proposal used to construct the SAA. When the optimization trajectory leaves this trust region, a new SAA is constructed.

- Experiments on Gaussians, Lotka-Volterra dynamics, and a Pickover attractor demonstrate that VISA can achieve comparable approximation accuracy to standard importance-weighted VI with computational savings of a factor of two or more for conservatively chosen learning rates.

So in summary, the main contribution is the VISA method itself, which adapts importance-weighted variational inference to use sequential sample-average approximations in order to reuse model evaluations and reduce the computational cost of approximate inference.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does VISA differ from existing SAA methods for reparameterized variational inference in terms of motivation and implementation requirements? What specifically allows VISA to reduce the number of model evaluations compared to these methods?

2) Explain in detail the process of constructing sequential sample-average approximations in VISA. How is the trust region defined and adapted during optimization?

3) The paper states that VISA is more susceptible to underestimating posterior variance compared to IWFVI. Provide a detailed analysis of why this occurs and potential remedies that are discussed. 

4) Discuss the differences between optimizing a forward and reverse KL divergence objective in variational inference. How does the choice of divergence measure impact issues like underestimation of variance and mode-seeking behavior?

5) Analyze the computational tradeoffs between using a deterministic SAA objective versus stochastic gradients in IWFVI. Under what conditions can reusing samples provide efficiency gains despite occasional refresh of the SAA?  

6) How suitable is VISA for models with a large number of parameters or latent variables? Explain limitations and relate to theoretical results on the requisite sample sizes for SAAs.

7) Compare and contrast the motivation and methodology of VISA to other VI methods that optimize a forward KL divergence such as wake-wake and doubly-reparameterized VI.

8) The paper experiments with L-BFGS for optimizing the SAA objective but finds instabilities. Provide an analysis of why second-order methods can fail in this setting and whether modifications like damping or trust regions could help.

9) Discuss the suitability of VISA for models with discrete variables or stochastic control flow. How does this differ from reparameterized VI?

10) Propose ways in which past SAA approximations could be leveraged instead of discarded when constructing a new approximation. Could computing validation losses over multiple old SAAs improve assessment of convergence?
