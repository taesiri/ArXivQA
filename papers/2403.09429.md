# [Variational Inference with Sequential Sample-Average Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09429)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Variational inference (VI) methods are commonly used for approximate Bayesian inference in models with intractable posteriors. However, VI methods like importance-weighted forward KL VI (IWFVI) require many model evaluations, which is computationally expensive for models based on numerical simulations.

Method: 
- The paper proposes variational inference with sequential sample-average approximations (VISA) to reduce the number of model evaluations.

- The key idea is to reuse model evaluations across multiple gradient update steps by constructing deterministic sample-average approximations (SAA) of the variational objective. 

- An SAA fixes samples from the current variational distribution and optimizes the importance-weighted objective deterministically. The samples are refreshed when the effective sample size falls below a threshold, indicating the old samples are no longer representative.

- This leads to an optimization process with a sequence of SAAs, each with a trust region defined by the ESS threshold. New samples are drawn when exiting the trust region.

Contributions:
- Proposes VISA, which adapts IWFVI to use sequential SAAs to reduce computational cost. This is shown to work for non-differentiable models.

- Defines the notion of trust regions based on an ESS threshold to determine when to construct a new SAA.

- Demonstrates computational savings of 2x or more on Gaussian models, Lotka-Volterra dynamics, and a Pickover attractor while maintaining comparable inference quality to IWFVI.

- Discusses limitations related to underestimating posterior variance and scaling to high-dimensional latent spaces.

In summary, the paper develops a method to reduce the computational cost of IWFVI using sequential SAAs, while maintaining inference quality in expensive non-differentiable models.
