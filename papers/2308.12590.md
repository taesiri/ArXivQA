# [Self-supervised Learning of Implicit Shape Representation with Dense   Correspondence for Deformable Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12590)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to learn an implicit shape representation that can represent deformable 3D objects with large deformations and provide dense correspondence across different poses, in a fully self-supervised manner without requiring additional semantic priors or annotations. 

The key ideas and contributions to address this question are:

- Proposing to constrain the template shape in the same latent space as the training shapes to get a reasonable template and prevent artifacts.

- Designing a novel local rigid constraint formulation that enforces rigid transformation in local regions and prevents flip mappings. This is an ARAP-equivalent constraint for implicit representations. 

- Introducing hierarchical rigid constraints with local, neighborhood, and piece-wise components to incorporate spatial context and large deformation priors to reduce ambiguity in joint learning of shape and correspondence.

- Demonstrating the capability of the learned representation on shape reconstruction, interpolation, correspondence estimation, and applications like texture transfer and shape editing.

So in summary, the main research contribution is a new self-supervised framework to learn an implicit neural representation for deformable 3D shapes that can effectively handle large deformations and establish dense correspondences, without needing any semantic priors or annotations. The key ideas are the embedded shape space, novel rigid constraints, and hierarchical multi-scale regularization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel self-supervised approach to learn an implicit neural representation for deformable 3D objects like humans and animals. The key advantage is that it does not require any additional annotations like skeletons or skinning weights.

2. It introduces three key techniques to handle large deformations in a self-supervised manner:

- Constraining the template shape to lie in the same latent space as the training shapes. This helps regularize the template shape.

- A new local rigid constraint formulation that enforces rigid transformations locally while avoiding reflection issues. This is an ARAP-equivalent constraint for implicit representations. 

- A hierarchical rigid constraint with local, neighborhood, and part-level components to incorporate spatial context and deal with large rigid parts.

3. Extensive experiments show the method can effectively represent shapes undergoing large deformations. Applications like texture transfer and shape editing also produce good results.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel self-supervised framework to learn an implicit neural representation for deformable shapes that does not need semantic domain-specific priors like skeletons. The techniques to handle large deformations in a self-supervised manner are key to making this approach work well.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised method to learn an implicit neural representation for deformable 3D objects that can reconstruct shapes, provide dense correspondences, and support applications like texture transfer and shape editing, using only a collection of example shapes without needing additional supervision.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of implicit shape representation with dense correspondence for deformable objects:

- Compared to other work on implicit deformable shape representation like DIF and Nerfies, this paper tackles the more challenging problem of modeling shapes with large deformations like humans and animals. It shows superior performance on representing these highly deformable shapes through novel techniques like the embedded latent shape space and hierarchical rigid constraints.

- The proposed local rigid constraint appears to be the first principled derivation of an ARAP-equivalent loss for implicit representations. This theoretically grounds the use of local rigidity regularization in a continuous field, overcoming limitations of prior heuristic smoothness losses.

- The hierarchical rigid constraints leverage spatial context across multiple scales to handle the ambiguity in jointly learning correspondences and template shape. This goes beyond just local smoothness used in prior works, better capturing real deformation patterns.

- For correspondence learning, they achieve state-of-the-art results compared to specialized correspondence methods like 3D-CODED and LoopReg, without relying on topological information or shape priors. The correspondence supervision is fully self-supervised end-to-end.

- Compared to skeleton-based methods, this approach does not require any semantic priors or annotation effort. It demonstrates competitive performance and applications using only raw SDF data, highlighting the potential of skeleton-free representations.

- The applications like texture transfer and shape editing showcase that the learned model encapsulates a useful deformation-aware shape space beyond just reconstruction. The editing also reveals interesting directions to constrain solution space further.

Overall, I think this paper pushes the state of the art in self-supervised dense correspondence learning for implicit deformable shapes. The introduced techniques help overcome limitations of prior arts to tackle more complex deformations in a principled unsupervised manner.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions:

1. Improving generalization to out-of-distribution data. The current method relies on learning deformations from the training data and does not use any skeleton prior, so it cannot represent novel shapes outside the distribution of the training data. Incorporating some skeletal priors could improve generalization.

2. Handling topology changes. The current method cannot handle topology changes like merging of body parts because it relies on geometric features like SDF values that cannot be correctly calculated when parts contact each other. Developing new representations that can handle topology changes is an important direction.

3. Adding constraints on the latent space. The latent codes currently lack smoothness constraints, so sampling random codes often results in invalid shapes. Adding constraints to enforce smoothly varying semantic changes in the latent space could allow interpolating between valid shapes.

4. Extending to broader shape classes. The current method focuses on humans/animals with large deformations. Applying and extending the techniques to represent more generic shape categories is an interesting direction.

5. Applications like shape editing could be improved by maintaining validity of shapes after deformation. For example, when editing the hands, the leg positions can change undesirably. Maintaining overall body validity during editing is an area for improvement.

In summary, the main future directions are improving generalization, handling topology changes, adding latent space constraints, broadening to more shape classes, and improving shape editing applications. Overall, developing more flexible and generic neural shape representations remains an open research problem.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel self-supervised approach to learn an implicit neural representation for deformable 3D objects. The key idea is to represent a deformable object as a template shape plus dense deformation fields that map points from the deformed target spaces to the canonical template space. During training, the template shape, deformation fields, and latent shape codes are optimized jointly on a collection of deformed shape examples to enable reconstructing the training shapes, interpolating new deformations, and establishing dense correspondences across different poses. 

Compared to prior works, this approach does not rely on any additional shape priors like skeletons or skins and works for more general deformable objects beyond humans/animals. To handle large deformations, the paper makes three key contributions: 1) constraining the template shape in the latent space of training shapes, 2) proposing a novel as-rigid-as-possible loss for implicit functions that handles reflections, and 3) introducing hierarchical rigid constraints that incorporate spatial context to reduce ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in terms of shape reconstruction, dense correspondence, and applications like texture transfer and editing. Limitations include generalization beyond the training distribution and handling topology changes.
