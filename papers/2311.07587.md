# [Frontier Language Models are not Robust to Adversarial Arithmetic, or   "What do I need to say so you agree 2+2=5?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07587)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces adversarial arithmetic as a testbed for probing language model alignment, finds frontier LMs vulnerable to arithmetically steering prompts, and shows RL adversarial training and agentic interventions provide partial but incomplete hardening.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the problem of adversarial arithmetic, where arithmetic questions posed in natural language have adversarial text inserted before the question is complete. Even simple 1-digit addition problems can be made to trick large language models like PaLM2 and GPT4 into giving the wrong answer using these adversarial prompts. The authors provide an algorithm called prompt inversion rejection sampling that can reliably generate attacks by querying the models themselves. They show that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via reinforcement learning and constitutional loops, where a model checks and potentially revises its answer. However, they were unable to make models fully robust to adversarial arithmetic attacks. The problem provides a useful testbed for studying alignment techniques, attacks, and mitigations in a setting where evaluation is straightforward.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces and studies adversarial arithmetic, using simple addition problems posed in natural language as a testbed for identifying and mitigating model misalignment vulnerabilities. The authors demonstrate that large language models like PaLM2 and GPT4 are highly susceptible to adversarial prompts that reliably steer them towards providing incorrect arithmetic answers. They introduce an effective algorithm called prompt inversion rejection sampling for adversarially generating such attacks by querying the model itself. They also show that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via techniques like reinforcement learning and constitutional agentic loops, though robustness is far from complete even after adversarial training. The paper provides a useful framework for studying alignment techniques, attacks, and defenses in a setting where ground truth is unambiguous, though still complex due to the open-endedness of natural language. Key results include the high transferability of attacks across models, the ability to steer models towards specific wrong answers, the effectiveness of prompt inversion rejection sampling for attack generation, the utility but limitations of adversarial training and agentic interventions as defenses, and the retention of some model vulnerabilities even after attempted hardening. Overall, this work highlights that while mitigations can help, alignment of large language models with intended behavior on even simple arithmetic remains a challenging open problem.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, the one-sentence TL;DR would be: The paper introduces and studies adversarial arithmetic attacks on language models, showing it is possible to reliably trick models into giving wrong answers, and explores techniques like reinforcement learning and constitutional agents to partially mitigate these attacks.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can frontier large language models like GPT and PaLM be made robust against adversarial attacks in simple arithmetic problems posed in natural language?

The authors introduce "adversarial arithmetic" as a testbed for studying alignment techniques, attacks and mitigations in language models. They show that it is easy to find adversarial prompts that make large language models like GPT and PaLM misbehave and steer them to wrong answers in simple arithmetic problems. They then explore techniques like reinforcement learning and constitutional "agentic loops" to harden models against such attacks. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that while models can be partially hardened against adversarial arithmetic attacks, the authors were unable to make them fully robust. The paper provides an analysis of the effectiveness of different adversarial hardening approaches and argues there is still room for improvement in making large language models reliably solve even simple arithmetic problems correctly in the face of adversarial attacks.
