# [Frontier Language Models are not Robust to Adversarial Arithmetic, or   "What do I need to say so you agree 2+2=5?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07587)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces adversarial arithmetic as a testbed for probing language model alignment, finds frontier LMs vulnerable to arithmetically steering prompts, and shows RL adversarial training and agentic interventions provide partial but incomplete hardening.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the problem of adversarial arithmetic, where arithmetic questions posed in natural language have adversarial text inserted before the question is complete. Even simple 1-digit addition problems can be made to trick large language models like PaLM2 and GPT4 into giving the wrong answer using these adversarial prompts. The authors provide an algorithm called prompt inversion rejection sampling that can reliably generate attacks by querying the models themselves. They show that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via reinforcement learning and constitutional loops, where a model checks and potentially revises its answer. However, they were unable to make models fully robust to adversarial arithmetic attacks. The problem provides a useful testbed for studying alignment techniques, attacks, and mitigations in a setting where evaluation is straightforward.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces and studies adversarial arithmetic, using simple addition problems posed in natural language as a testbed for identifying and mitigating model misalignment vulnerabilities. The authors demonstrate that large language models like PaLM2 and GPT4 are highly susceptible to adversarial prompts that reliably steer them towards providing incorrect arithmetic answers. They introduce an effective algorithm called prompt inversion rejection sampling for adversarially generating such attacks by querying the model itself. They also show that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via techniques like reinforcement learning and constitutional agentic loops, though robustness is far from complete even after adversarial training. The paper provides a useful framework for studying alignment techniques, attacks, and defenses in a setting where ground truth is unambiguous, though still complex due to the open-endedness of natural language. Key results include the high transferability of attacks across models, the ability to steer models towards specific wrong answers, the effectiveness of prompt inversion rejection sampling for attack generation, the utility but limitations of adversarial training and agentic interventions as defenses, and the retention of some model vulnerabilities even after attempted hardening. Overall, this work highlights that while mitigations can help, alignment of large language models with intended behavior on even simple arithmetic remains a challenging open problem.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, the one-sentence TL;DR would be: The paper introduces and studies adversarial arithmetic attacks on language models, showing it is possible to reliably trick models into giving wrong answers, and explores techniques like reinforcement learning and constitutional agents to partially mitigate these attacks.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can frontier large language models like GPT and PaLM be made robust against adversarial attacks in simple arithmetic problems posed in natural language?

The authors introduce "adversarial arithmetic" as a testbed for studying alignment techniques, attacks and mitigations in language models. They show that it is easy to find adversarial prompts that make large language models like GPT and PaLM misbehave and steer them to wrong answers in simple arithmetic problems. They then explore techniques like reinforcement learning and constitutional "agentic loops" to harden models against such attacks. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that while models can be partially hardened against adversarial arithmetic attacks, the authors were unable to make them fully robust. The paper provides an analysis of the effectiveness of different adversarial hardening approaches and argues there is still room for improvement in making large language models reliably solve even simple arithmetic problems correctly in the face of adversarial attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces "adversarial arithmetic" as a testbed for exploring language model alignment, where models must answer arithmetic questions correctly even in the presence of adversarial text inserted before the question. 

2. It provides an algorithm called "prompt inversion rejection sampling" (PIRS) for generating semantically rich adversarial attacks that can reliably steer models to make specific arithmetic errors.

3. It analyzes attack success rates and how they depend on factors like model size, error magnitude being targeted, etc.

4. It shows that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via reinforcement learning and "agentic constitutional loops", though not made fully robust.

5. More broadly, it helps characterize when and how language models fail at arithmetic reasoning, and provides a framework for exploring techniques to improve alignment and mitigate vulnerabilities.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing adversarial arithmetic as a challenging but well-defined testbed for studying language model capabilities, developing attacks and mitigations, and characterizing when/how models fail in this setting. The attacks, hardening techniques, and analyses help illuminate the alignment frontier.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper comparing to other research on adversarial attacks against language models:

- The focus on arithmetic as a simple test domain is novel. Most prior work has looked at more complex adversarial goals like eliciting harmful text, rather than just getting the model to make a numerical error. Using arithmetic makes the problem crisp and evaluation straightforward.

- The prompt inversion rejection sampling (PIRS) attack generation method is simple but effective for this domain. It's similar in spirit to some gradient-free blackbox attack methods, but tailored to leverage the power and invertibility of language models.

- The analysis of how attack success probability scales with model size and desired error magnitude provides useful insights. The results are somewhat preliminary given the limited model set, but suggest adversarial robustness does not clearly improve with scale.

- The mitigation strategies of RL fine-tuning and constitutional checking are standard techniques adapted to this problem. The partial effectiveness shown here is encouraging but not entirely surprising. Testing their robustness to white-box attacks would be interesting future work. 

- The inclusion of diagnostic probes like copying tasks and procedural word problems provides a useful framework for tracking unintended side effects of adversarial training. This helps expose the capability-robustness tradeoffs.

Overall, the paper makes a nice contribution in analyzing adversarial attacks in this restricted but meaningful arithmetic domain. The insights on attack generation, robustness trends, and mitigation strategies help advance the understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities in language models. More work remains to achieve true robustness, but this provides a useful foundation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further exploring the effects of model size on adversarial robustness. The results in the paper are somewhat unclear on how model size impacts vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Scaling up experiments could provide more insight.

- Studying the properties of attack-generating prompts that confer the best out-of-distribution robustness after adversarial training. The authors found that their training method provides some robustness to new attacks, but there is room for improvement.

- Better understanding the causes of performance degradation on auxiliary tasks during adversarial training, and developing techniques to mitigate this. The authors show drops in performance on some BIG-bench tasks during training.

- Exploring the effects of different hyperparameters in the adversarial training procedure on downstream evaluation metrics. The authors did a small hyperparameter study but note there are complicated tradeoffs between settings.

- Investigating why agentic interventions like allowing models to revise their answers can sometimes reduce performance of adversarially hardened models. The interaction between revisions and robustness needs clarification.

- Scaling up experiments to larger models to see how findings generalize. The authors primarily experimented on smaller models like PaLM-2.

So in summary, the authors lay out a number of open questions around model scaling, training techniques, auxiliary task transfer, agentic interventions, and more. Their proposed adversarial arithmetic benchmark provides a testbed for future work to address these questions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the paper:

1. The paper introduces "adversarial arithmetic" as a testbed for alignment techniques. How well does this simple domain capture the complexity and nuance of assessing alignment in more open-ended settings? What are the limitations of focusing on adversarial arithmetic as opposed to a more general notion of alignment?

2. Prompt inversion rejection sampling (PIRS) is proposed as a method to generate adversarial attacks. How efficient and effective is this approach compared to other potential attack generation techniques like gradient-based optimization or evolutionary strategies? Are there ways to improve the attack generation process? 

3. The paper shows attack success probability does not clearly correlate with model size. What factors may better explain model robustness against these attacks besides size? For instance, could model architecture, training data, or fine-tuning approach play a bigger role?

4. How transferable are the adversarial attacks across model families? Are there common failures being exploited, or do the attacks tend to be model-specific? Are there defenses that could make models more robust to out-of-distribution attacks?

5. The mitigation strategies of RL fine-tuning and constitutional revision offer partial protection but do not fully solve the problem. Why do these approaches fall short? Are there other defenses worth exploring that could complement them?

6. How susceptible are different evaluation metrics to overfitting during adversarial training? Can this be mitigated by techniques like early stopping? Are there better diagnostic measures to track?

7. The hyperparameter study highlights complex tradeoffs between metrics during adversarial training. How can these interactions be better understood? Could automated tuning help find optimal hyperparameters?

8. How do the attacks scale to more complex, multi-step arithmetic problems? Are models more or less susceptible compared to single-operation problems?

9. Beyond arithmetic, how do these attack and defense techniques apply to other structured domains like logic, planning, or game playing? What new challenges arise in those settings?

10. The paper focuses on promoting correct behavior in models. How do these methods relate to ensuring models are harmless? Should alignment research prioritize safety over accuracy?
