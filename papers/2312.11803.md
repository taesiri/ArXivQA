# [Designing Guiding Principles for NLP for Healthcare: A Case Study of   Maternal Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is increasing excitement about using large language models (LLMs) for healthcare applications, but ethical guidelines are urgently needed to ensure these tools are used responsibly. This is especially important in sensitive contexts like maternal health.

- LLMs could exacerbate existing challenges in maternal healthcare such as systemic health disparities, historical injustices, imbalances in clinician-patient relationships, etc.

Methodology:
- The authors employ a participatory design framework to develop ethical guidelines for using NLP in maternal healthcare. 

- They introduce stakeholders (clinicians, birthing people, public health workers etc.) to an LLM-based chatbot and gather their feedback through surveys and discussions.

- Analyzing this data, they identify key themes and consolidate them into 9 guiding principles grouped into 3 categories: Context, Measurements, Values.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes 9 principles to guide use of NLP tools in maternal health spanning awareness of historical context, choosing appropriate optimizations, centering stakeholder voices. 

- Demonstrates a participatory methodology to develop AI ethics guidelines tailored to a specific healthcare context by eliciting perspectives from diverse stakeholders.

- Provides a blueprint to map tensions and surface considerations when deploying AI systems in other complex healthcare settings involving multiple vulnerable groups.

- Discusses insights like the contrast between stakeholder needs and current trends in NLP research, and notes further open questions around weighing risks vs benefits of using AI chatbots.
