# [Levenshtein Distance Embedding with Poisson Regression for DNA Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07931)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Computing the Levenshtein distance between sequences has high computational complexity which limits its application in domains like DNA storage. 
- Prior work has tried to embed Levenshtein distance into Euclidean spaces to allow faster approximation using neural networks, but limitations exist in determining embedding dimension and designing optimal loss functions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel Levenshtein distance embedding method using Poisson regression to address limitations of prior work.
- Provide theoretical analysis on impact of embedding dimension on approximation accuracy, and propose a method to determine optimal "early stopping dimension (ESD)".
- Use Poisson regression by modeling Levenshtein distance as a Poisson distributed random variable, which naturally fits the definition of Levenshtein distance. Poisson regression also approximates chi-squared distribution for embedding distances to address skewness.

Key Contributions:
- Theoretical analysis on role of embedding dimension on approximation accuracy and proposal of ESD selection method.
- Introduction of Poisson regression for Levenshtein distance embedding to align with definition and address skewness limitations.
- Comprehensive experiments on DNA storage data validating efficacy of ESD analysis and showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in approximation accuracy.

In summary, the key novelty is in the rigorous theoretical analysis for optimal parameter selection and use of Poisson regression to design an improved Levenshtein distance embedding technique. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements over other methods on DNA storage data.
