# [Levenshtein Distance Embedding with Poisson Regression for DNA Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07931)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel neural network-based sequence embedding technique for approximating the Levenshtein distance using Poisson regression. The authors first provide a theoretical analysis on the impact of embedding dimension, deriving a criterion to select an appropriate "early-stopping dimension" (ESD). Under this ESD, they introduce Poisson regression by viewing the Levenshtein distance as a Poisson-distributed random variable, which naturally fits the definition of counting edit operations. Furthermore, Poisson regression approximates the negative log-likelihood of the chi-squared distribution used in prior works, while addressing the issue of skewness. Comprehensive experiments on DNA storage data validate the efficacy of the ESD analysis and demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Key innovations include theoretically-grounded dimension selection, intuitive modeling of Levenshtein distance as a Poisson variable, and mathematically-principled loss function design through connections to chi-squared regression. Together, these contributions advance the state-of-the-art in embedding techniques for the highly useful Levenshtein distance metric.
