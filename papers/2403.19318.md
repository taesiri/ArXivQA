# [TableLLM: Enabling Tabular Data Manipulation by LLMs in Real Office   Usage Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19318)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper identifies two key challenges in enabling large language models (LLMs) to handle tabular data manipulation tasks catering to real-world office usage scenarios: (1) Diverse operations like query, update, merge and chart required, going beyond just question answering. (2) Unique processing approaches needed for document-embedded vs spreadsheet-embedded tabular data. Existing methods fall short in effectively addressing both data types and the full range of operations simultaneously.

Solution:
The paper proposes TableLLM, a 13B parameter model specifically tailored for tabular data manipulation. It handles document-embedded tabular data using an inner-parameter driven approach to query hybrid text and tables. For spreadsheet-embedded data, it utilizes a code-driven technique invoking pandas operations to manipulate extensive regular tables. 

Key contributions:
(1) Constructs high-quality distant supervision data using an expanded reasoning process for existing QA pairs and automatic generation with cross-way validation. Proves theoretically that cross-way outperforms single/same-way validation.
(2) Designs meticulous prompts and evaluation metrics tailored to document vs spreadsheet embedded scenarios and the diverse operations.
(3) TableLLM outperforms prior SOTA models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for spreadsheet data, demonstrating robust performance.
(4) Provides full model, code, benchmark and web app to facilitate accessibility and community collaboration.

In summary, the paper makes pioneering progress in enabling LLMs to proficiently handle real-world tabular data manipulation needs across documents and spreadsheets via tailored tuning strategies, high-quality distant supervision and scenario-specific prompts.
