# [Re-Nerfing: Enforcing Geometric Constraints on Neural Radiance Fields   through Novel Views Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive novel view synthesis capabilities, but still suffer from artifacts and shape-radiance ambiguities when trained with sparse views. This leads to erroneous scene geometry and floaters. Providing additional supervision through depth and structure is beneficial but unreliable depth estimates can hurt performance.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Re-Nerfing, a multi-stage approach that enhances NeRF's own novel view synthesis to address these limitations. It works as follows:
1) Train a baseline NeRF model on the available views 
2) Use this NeRF to synthesize additional pseudo-views next to the original ones, simulating a stereo/trifocal setup
3) Train a second NeRF model on both original and pseudo-views, enforcing epipolar constraints between them to improve geometric consistency

Main Contributions:
- Show that NeRF's view synthesis can enhance its own rendering quality 
- Propose Re-Nerfing technique to improve NeRF using novel view synthesis and pseudo-stereo constraints
- Introduce novel epipolar geometry based density loss for stereo NeRF optimization
- Evaluate quality of synthesized views based on visibility in training views

Experiments show Re-Nerfing improves state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF in both dense and sparse settings. The pseudo-views help mitigate shape-radiance ambiguity, while the epipolar constraints enforce geometric consistency. Re-Nerfing is simple, general, and effective in enhancing NeRF's novel view synthesis.
