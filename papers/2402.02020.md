## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional SLAM methods using explicit representations (point clouds, voxels, etc.) struggle to capture detailed color/lighting information, leading to sparse or inconsistent maps. 
- Neural Radiance Fields can represent scenes in a compact yet powerful way for photorealistic rendering, but have efficiency issues.  
- Existing NeRF-SLAM systems have difficulties with efficiently incrementally expanding scenes over time.

Proposed Solution - NeuV-SLAM
- Uses neural multiresolution voxels for implicit scene representation.
- Proposes hashMV - efficient voxel management structure enabling rapid dynamic scene expansion while maintaining small memory footprint. 
- Proposes VDF - a novel implicit representation anchoring neural features and Signed Distance Fields directly in voxels, with SDF activation for efficient convergence.

Key Contributions:
- NeuV-SLAM pipeline using neural multiresolution voxels for rapid convergence and incremental scene expansion.
- hashMV structure for efficient voxel management supporting scalability.
- VDF representation for fast convergence by optimizing neural features and SDF in voxels. 
- Evaluated on Replica & ScanNet datasets, shows great performance in convergence speed, reconstruction quality, tracking accuracy and rendering over state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, NeuV-SLAM introduces innovations in neural multiresolution voxel representations and management to enable an efficient and scalable SLAM system with exceptional reconstruction, tracking and rendering capabilities surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.
