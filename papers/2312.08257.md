# [\emph{Lifted} RDT based capacity analysis of the 1-hidden layer treelike   \emph{sign} perceptrons neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08257)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the memory capacity of treelike committee machines (TCM) with sign activation functions. It builds on recent work that used random duality theory (RDT) to characterize the capacity, but showed that while RDT works well for small numbers of hidden neurons, it overestimates capacity for very large networks. This paper introduces a partially lifted RDT approach that gives closed-form analytical capacity bounds that improve universally over the best prior mathematical bounds for any number of hidden neurons. The key finding is that adding hidden neurons boosts memory capacity beyond that of a single perceptron, contradicting some prior bounds, but that care is needed in the analysis to avoid overestimating the gains. Analytically tractable capacity characterizations are derived for general network sizes. Extensions to other activations and architectures are noted as interesting future work.
