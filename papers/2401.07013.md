# [Knowledge Distillation for Closed-Source Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07013)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Knowledge distillation (KD) from large closed-source language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to smaller open-source LLMs is challenging since the soft labels (output distributions) of closed-source models are not accessible. Existing approaches prompt the closed-source LLM to generate samples and fine-tune the student model on those samples, which mainly transfers input-output patterns rather than intrinsic knowledge. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a Bayesian estimation framework to estimate the soft labels of closed-source LLMs by leveraging:
1) Prior estimation: Derives a coarse-grained prior distribution from the corpus generated by the closed-source LLM using an optimized n-gram algorithm.
2) Posterior estimation: Calibrates the prior via sampling from an intermediate open-source LLM (proxy model) aligned to mimic the closed-source LLM. This results in a fine-grained posterior distribution.
The estimated distributions enable traditional KD from the closed-source to open-source LLM by minimizing KL divergence between estimated and student output distributions.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel Bayesian estimation method to derive estimated soft labels for closed-source LLMs to enable traditional KD.
- Introduces a proxy model to bridge gap between closed-source teacher and open-source student.
- Achieves superior performance over baseline that simply fine-tunes on samples from closed-source LLM.
- Provides extensive analysis on impact of corpus size, proxy model selection, number of sampling rounds etc.
- Demonstrates averaged improvements of 3-5 accuracy points over competitive baselines on multiple benchmarks.

In summary, the key innovation is an estimation method to obtain pseudo soft labels for KD from closed-source LLMs, outperforming sample-based transfer learning approaches. The introduction of a proxy model is vital to enabling this technique.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Bayesian estimation framework to estimate the output distributions of closed-source language models for knowledge distillation, which involves prior estimation using the corpus from the teacher model and posterior estimation using a proxy model to refine the prior.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to estimate the output distributions of closed-source language models like GPT-4 within a Bayesian estimation framework, in order to perform knowledge distillation from these models to smaller open-source models. Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Perform prior estimation to derive a coarse-grained prior distribution over the closed-source teacher's outputs by analyzing a corpus of samples from the teacher. 

2) Perform posterior estimation using a large open-source proxy model to refine the prior into a finer-grained posterior distribution that better approximates the teacher's outputs.

3) Use the estimated posterior distribution in place of the true soft labels from the closed-source teacher to distill knowledge into the smaller open-source student model through traditional distillation techniques.

By estimating the closed-source teacher's output distributions, this allows more effective distillation from closed-source models compared to only using their generated samples, enabling the transfer of richer knowledge into the student models. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches on multiple benchmarks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Knowledge distillation - Transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model
- Closed-source language models - Referring to proprietary large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 that are not openly accessible
- Bayesian estimation framework - Using Bayesian methods for prior and posterior estimation of the teacher model's outputs
- Prior estimation - Deriving a coarse-grained prior distribution of the teacher's outputs using its generated text corpus  
- Posterior estimation - Refining the prior distribution using a proxy model to get a better estimate of the teacher's outputs
- Proxy model - An intermediate open-source language model used to bridge between the teacher and student models
- Output distribution estimation - Estimating the output token probabilities of the closed-source teacher model
- Soft labels - The predicted token probabilities used in traditional knowledge distillation

In summary, the key focus is on applying Bayesian estimation techniques to derive estimated soft label distributions from closed-source language models, which enables more effective knowledge transfer to a smaller student model.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Bayesian estimation framework involving both prior and posterior estimation to estimate the output distributions of closed-source language models. Can you elaborate more on the theoretical justification behind this Bayesian framework? How does it help with the knowledge distillation task?

2. The prior estimation method utilizes an n-gram algorithm to derive a prior distribution from the corpus generated by the closed-source teacher model. What is the intuition behind using the n-gram method here? How does the choice of n impact the resulting prior distribution? 

3. The posterior estimation employs a proxy model to refine the prior distribution. What are the desiderata for an effective proxy model in this framework? What might be some good proxy model choices beyond the ones explored in the paper?

4. The paper sets the hyperparameter γ to 3 in the prior estimation method. What is the effect of using different values for γ? What might be some principled ways to set the value of this hyperparameter?

5. What might be some ways to quantify or validate how well the estimated distributions from the proposed method match the actual distributions from the closed-source teacher? Are there any experiments you would suggest to analyze this?

6. How does the proposed method compare to other student-teacher distillation methods that do have access to the teacher's soft labels? What unique advantages does the proposed method offer?

7. One could consider the proxy model itself as the student model. How well does the proxy model perform compared to the actual smaller student model used in the experiments? What are the tradeoffs?

8. The paper focuses on multiple choice tasks. How challenging might it be to apply the proposed distillation method to open-ended generation tasks? What modifications might be needed?

9. Error analysis: On what types of datasets or tasks does the proposed method underperform baseline instruction fine-tuning? What might be the reasons?

10. The paper mentions using Lora for efficient training. How does Lora work? What are its benefits and limitations in the context of knowledge distillation?
