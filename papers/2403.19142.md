# [A Tulu Resource for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19142)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tulu is a low-resource Dravidian language spoken by about 2.5 million people in India. It lacks parallel datasets and resources for machine translation (MT). This hinders translation accessibility for the language. 

- Machine translation for low-resource languages faces challenges due to lack of abundant parallel data and domain diversity. Transfer learning methods can help overcome these hurdles by utilizing available resources in related languages.

Solution:
- The authors created the first parallel English-Tulu dataset by extending the multilingual FLORES-200 benchmark with 1,300 human-translated Tulu sentences.

- They developed an English-Tulu neural MT system using transfer learning to leverage available Kannada resources, as Kannada is a related language. Their method combines back-translation and denoising autoencoding.

- Without using parallel English-Tulu data, their best system achieves 25.97 BLEU on Tulu-English translation, outperforming Google Translate by 19 BLEU points.

Main Contributions:
- Introduced the first parallel dataset for English-Tulu translation by extending FLORES-200 benchmark.

- Developed an English-Tulu MT system using transfer learning from Kannada. The system does not use parallel English-Tulu data.

- Demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning for low-resource MT. Their Tulu-English system outperforms Google Translate despite not using English-Tulu parallel data.

In summary, the paper makes Tulu more accessible to machine translation by creating the first English-Tulu dataset and MT system. The transfer learning method enables MT development even without direct parallel data.
