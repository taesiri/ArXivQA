# [Bandit Structured Prediction for Learning from Partial Feedback in   Statistical Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04468)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach called Bandit Structured Prediction for performing structured prediction from bandit feedback. In contrast to traditional structured prediction which assumes full supervision, bandit structured prediction only receives partial feedback limited to the loss evaluation of a single predicted output structure. The approach is analyzed theoretically within the framework of stochastic approximation using pseudogradient methods, which provide asymptotic guarantees of convergence to a critical point. Experiments are presented for an application to statistical machine translation, where models are adapted from out-of-domain to in-domain data based solely on simulated user feedback of single-point BLEU loss evaluations without access to references. Results show the bandit structured prediction approach significantly improves on the out-of-domain baseline and achieves performance comparable to structured dueling bandits using twice as expensive two-point feedback. The method shows promise for real-world interactive machine translation applications where full information supervision is infeasible due to the effort or expertise required from users to provide feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a bandit structured prediction approach for learning from partial feedback in statistical machine translation, where the learning algorithm only has access to a 1-BLEU loss evaluation of a predicted translation instead of obtaining a gold standard reference translation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. An algorithm for minimization of expected loss for structured prediction from bandit feedback, called Bandit Structured Prediction.

2. An analysis of convergence of their algorithm in the stochastic optimization framework of pseudogradient adaptation. 

3. An experimental evaluation on structured learning in statistical machine translation (SMT). Their experiment follows a simulation design that is standard in bandit learning, namely by simulating bandit feedback by evaluating task loss functions against gold standard structures without revealing them to the learning algorithm.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel algorithm for structured prediction that can learn from limited "bandit" feedback, analyzing its theoretical properties, and demonstrating its effectiveness empirically on an SMT task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper presents an approach called "Bandit Structured Prediction". What is the key idea behind this approach and how does it differ from traditional structured prediction methods? 

2. The paper employs a simulation design for the experiments that is common in bandit learning. Can you explain what this simulation design is and why it is suitable for evaluating bandit learning algorithms?

3. The paper shows convergence of the proposed algorithm using the framework of pseudogradient adaptation. Can you summarize the key conditions that need to be satisfied for this convergence result to hold? How easy or difficult is it to verify these conditions?

4. For comparison, the paper also presents an extension of the dueling bandits algorithm to structured prediction. What are the key differences between the dueling bandits approach and bandit structured prediction in terms of the type of feedback required? What are the implications for real-world applications?

5. The experiment in the paper is on statistical machine translation. Can you think of other potential NLP applications where the bandit structured prediction approach could be beneficial? What challenges might come up in those settings? 

6. The paper discusses using per-sentence BLEU versus metrics like HTER or Likert scales for user feedback in interactive MT settings. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of each type of feedback signal?

7. The convergence analysis relies on the objective function having a Lipschitz continuous gradient. What challenges arise if this condition is violated, for example in highly non-convex problems? How could the analysis be extended?

8. How does the bandit structured prediction setting compare to other partial information settings like learning from positive examples only? What unique challenges does the bandit scenario introduce?

9. Could you extend the proposed approach to incorporate contextual bandit information like user features? What algorithm modifications would be needed?

10. A current limitation mentioned is comparison to full information methods. Can you suggest ways the bandit approach could potentially improve over full information structured prediction in some scenarios? What would be necessary to demonstrate this?
