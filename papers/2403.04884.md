# [Optimizing Retinal Prosthetic Stimuli with Conditional Invertible Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04884)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Retinal implants aim to restore partial vision for people with retinal diseases by converting images from a camera into electrical stimuli to activate remaining retinal cells. However, the low resolution of implant electrode arrays and lack of cell-type specificity limit information transmission and result in suboptimal stimuli. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose using normalizing flow-based conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) to optimize retinal implant stimuli. Specifically:

- INNs can inherently learn the forward computational model of the visual pathway (camera input to percept) and automatically obtain the inverse model (percept to optimized stimuli) due to invertibility.  

- Conditioning the INN on the input image allows generating optimized stimuli that meet desired constraints.

- INNs are generative models well-suited for solving inverse problems.

Contributions:

- Formulated retinal implant optimization as an inverse problem solvable with INNs.

- Developed conditional INN model to encode input images into optimized electrical stimuli.

- Demonstrated cINN model reconstructs input images better than baseline methods per multiple metrics, using a validated retinal model.

- Showed model works for high-resolution inputs/percepts and has fewer parameters than non-invertible networks.

In summary, the paper presents cINNs as a promising approach to enhance retinal implant visual quality by learning the inverse model to transform visual inputs into optimized electrical stimuli. Key advantages are leveraging invertibility for model interpretation and stimulus optimization subject to constraints.
