# [Optimizing Retinal Prosthetic Stimuli with Conditional Invertible Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04884)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Retinal implants aim to restore partial vision for people with retinal diseases by converting images from a camera into electrical stimuli to activate remaining retinal cells. However, the low resolution of implant electrode arrays and lack of cell-type specificity limit information transmission and result in suboptimal stimuli. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose using normalizing flow-based conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) to optimize retinal implant stimuli. Specifically:

- INNs can inherently learn the forward computational model of the visual pathway (camera input to percept) and automatically obtain the inverse model (percept to optimized stimuli) due to invertibility.  

- Conditioning the INN on the input image allows generating optimized stimuli that meet desired constraints.

- INNs are generative models well-suited for solving inverse problems.

Contributions:

- Formulated retinal implant optimization as an inverse problem solvable with INNs.

- Developed conditional INN model to encode input images into optimized electrical stimuli.

- Demonstrated cINN model reconstructs input images better than baseline methods per multiple metrics, using a validated retinal model.

- Showed model works for high-resolution inputs/percepts and has fewer parameters than non-invertible networks.

In summary, the paper presents cINNs as a promising approach to enhance retinal implant visual quality by learning the inverse model to transform visual inputs into optimized electrical stimuli. Key advantages are leveraging invertibility for model interpretation and stimulus optimization subject to constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using conditional invertible neural networks to optimize retinal prosthetic stimuli by modeling the visual pathway as an invertible mapping from percepts to stimuli, allowing inverse prediction of optimized stimuli for given targets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing to use conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) to optimize retinal prosthetic stimuli. Specifically:

- They formulate the optimization of retinal prosthetic stimuli as an inverse problem, where the goal is to find the optimized stimulus that can generate the desired percept through the visual pathway system. 

- They propose to use normalizing flow-based conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) for this task. The invertibility allows cINNs to be used as a surrogate model of the visual system, while also encoding input camera signals into optimized electrical stimuli. 

- They compare cINNs to other methods like trivial downsampling, linear models, feedforward CNNs, and non-conditional INNs. Results using a simulated retina model show cINNs yield better reconstruction quality and visual metrics.

So in summary, the key contribution is using the conditional invertible neural network architecture specifically for the task of optimizing retinal prosthesis stimuli, and showing its advantages over alternative approaches. The invertibility and conditioning properties are leveraged for this application.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) for optimizing retinal prosthetic stimuli. How exactly does the invertibility and conditioning in cINNs help with solving this optimization problem compared to other deep learning models?

2. The axon map model from Pulse2Percept is used for simulation in this work. What are the key parameters and assumptions of this model? How may variations in those parameters affect the optimization approach and results?

3. Normalizing flows are used to construct the invertible neural networks. What is the main idea behind normalizing flows? What specific normalizing flow architectures and building blocks are used in this work and why?

4. An unsupervised maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss is used during INN training in addition to the supervised MSE loss. What is the motivation behind using the MMD loss? How does it complement the MSE loss?

5. The paper finds defining the percept-to-stimulus mapping as the forward process makes inverse mapping easier to train for INNs. What may be the reasons behind this? How can this inform INN architecture design?  

6. For cINNs, the paper uses a maximum likelihood training strategy based on the negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss. Why is maximizing likelihood useful here? How does the NLL loss connect with minimizing the MSE?

7. The conditioning input in cINNs seems critical to optimize stimuli properly. What are the implications of different choices of conditioning inputs during training vs evaluation?

8. The Pulse2Percept simulation uses fixed model parameters ρ and λ. How could incorporating uncertainty in those parameters affect the cINN training and optimization approach?

9. What other perceptual similarity metrics beyond MSE, SSIM, PSNR could be relevant for evaluating retinal prosthesis optimization? How may those provide additional insights?

10. What are the main challenges and open questions in translating this optimization approach to real-world human implantees with retinal prostheses?
