# [Expand BERT Representation with Visual Information via Grounded Language   Learning with Multimodal Partial Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01592)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes GroundedBERT, a grounded language learning model that incorporates visual information into the BERT language representation. The key idea is to equip the contextual word embeddings from BERT with additional visually-grounded embeddings that capture semantics from paired images. 

Specifically, GroundedBERT has two components - the original BERT that provides contextual text embeddings, and a visual grounding module that outputs grounded embeddings using image features from a Vision Transformer. These two representations are concatenated to create a unified visual-textual embedding for each token. 

The model alignments between modalities using Partial Optimal Transport, which provides more flexibility than classical OT to find matches between local visual elements like image patches and word tokens.

The grounded representations from GroundedBERT significantly outperform baseline BERT and other vision-language models like VisualBERT on a range of NLP tasks including GLUE and SQuAD question answering. This demonstrates that grounding with visual data can enhance language understanding without compromising the linguistic knowledge captured by BERT.

In summary, this work effectively incorporates visual grounding into language models through a secondary grounding module and improved cross-modal alignment. The resulting GroundedBERT representations unite contextual text semantics from BERT with additional visual semantics, leading to gains in NLP performance.
