# [Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning
  for Numerical Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12588)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we disentangle computation from reasoning when teaching language models to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks?

In particular, the paper proposes an approach called "Program of Thoughts" (PoT) that allows language models to generate programs expressing reasoning steps, while delegating the actual computation to an interpreter. This allows decoupling complex computation from language understanding and reasoning. 

The key hypothesis is that by separating out the computation component, PoT will be more effective at eliciting language models' reasoning capabilities compared to having the model perform both reasoning and computation (as in the Chain of Thoughts or CoT approach).

The paper evaluates this hypothesis by testing PoT on several math word problem and financial QA datasets. The main findings are that PoT outperforms CoT significantly, with average gains of around 12% across the datasets. This supports the hypothesis that disentangling reasoning from computation leads to better reasoning performance from language models.

In summary, the core research question is how to elicit better reasoning from language models by separating out the computation component. PoT is proposed as a method to test this hypothesis, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness versus an integrated reasoning+computation approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing "Program of Thoughts" (PoT) prompting, which uses language models to generate programs that express reasoning steps for solving numerical reasoning tasks. The key ideas are:

- PoT generates programs instead of just text explanations. This allows delegating complex computations to an interpreter, decoupling computation from reasoning. 

- PoT aims to elicit "thoughtful" programs from language models by using semantic variable names and breaking reasoning into multiple steps.

- PoT is evaluated on a diverse set of math word problem and financial QA datasets. It significantly outperforms prior work like Chain of Thoughts prompting across both few-shot and zero-shot settings.

- PoT combined with self-consistency decoding achieves new state-of-the-art results on several benchmark math reasoning datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting PoT as an effective method for numerical reasoning that disentangles reasoning and computation. By generating "programs of thoughts", PoT takes better advantage of language models' reasoning capabilities while outsourcing complex computations. The broad experiments demonstrate the general applicability and strong performance of PoT.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper proposes a new method called "Program of Thoughts" (PoT) for teaching language models to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. The key idea is to have the model generate Python code representing the reasoning steps, rather than just natural language rationales as in prior "Chain of Thoughts" (CoT) approaches. 

- The separation of reasoning and computation is a novel aspect of PoT compared to prior work. By having an external Python interpreter execute the generated code, PoT offloads the complex computations from the language model and focuses it just on reasoning/understanding.

- The paper conducts experiments across several math word problem and financial QA datasets. The results show PoT outperforms CoT significantly, especially on more complex problems involving large numbers, equations, iteration etc. This demonstrates the benefits of PoT's approach.

- PoT combined with self-consistency decoding achieves state-of-the-art results on the math datasets, surpassing prior CoT results. On financial QA, PoT obtains near state-of-the-art performance.

- Compared to other concurrent work like LiLA that focuses on dataset assembly, this paper provides a thorough investigation into how to elicit reasoning from LLMs via "thoughtful" program generation. The zero-shot experiments also show the potential to generalize without dataset-specific examples.

- Overall, PoT presents a novel prompting technique for numerical reasoning that advanced the state-of-the-art by decoupling reasoning and computation in an interpretable and accurate way. The comprehensive experiments and ablation studies provide useful insights into this approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more robust techniques for generating "thoughtful" programs to elicit reasoning from language models. The authors propose "program of thoughts" (PoT) as an initial approach, but suggest more work could be done to make this prompting process more generalizable and less sensitive to the specific demonstrations provided. 

- Exploring how to combine symbolic execution and language models more effectively. PoT shows promise in using an external program interpreter to handle computation separately from reasoning. The authors believe this direction of integrating symbolic methods with large language models could be fruitful for complex reasoning tasks.

- Applying PoT to more challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. The authors evaluate PoT on several math word problem and financial QA datasets. But they suggest exploring performance on datasets requiring more advanced mathematical reasoning beyond arithmetic and algebra.

- Developing techniques to reduce value grounding errors in PoT and related methods. The error analysis indicates value retrieval is a major source of errors. Future work could aim to improve variable/value extraction from the context.

- Investigating if PoT can enable language models to solve complex equations beyond their inherent capabilities. The authors indicate PoT allows solving equations like polynomials that language models cannot do alone. More analysis could be done on the scope of math problems addressable through this approach.

- Exploring additional reasoning tasks where decoupling reasoning from computation could be beneficial. The authors frame PoT mainly for math reasoning but suggest it may be useful for other reasoning tasks that require non-trivial computation.

Overall, the authors frame PoT as an initial approach and encourage further work to realize the promise of combining language models with more structured representations to solve challenging reasoning tasks. Robust program generation, integrating symbolic methods, and addressing value grounding seem highlighted as key next directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes 'Program of Thoughts' (PoT), a method that uses language models like Codex to generate programs in order to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. PoT allows the model to express its reasoning in a program while delegating the actual computation to an interpreter, thus separating reasoning from calculation. The authors evaluate PoT on several math word problem and financial QA datasets under few-shot and zero-shot settings. Across all datasets, PoT significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, Chain of Thoughts (CoT), by around 12% on average. By combining PoT with self-consistency decoding, the authors achieve new state-of-the-art results on the math datasets and near state-of-the-art on the financial datasets. The gains over CoT demonstrate PoT's ability to elicit more accurate reasoning from the language model by expressing it as a program, while avoiding errors in complex calculations. Overall, PoT shows strong potential for numerical reasoning by disentangling reasoning and computation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Program of Thoughts (PoT) for teaching large language models to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. PoT uses language models to generate Python code representing the reasoning steps and mathematical computations needed to solve a problem, rather than just generating natural language explanations like in the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) approach. The key advantage of PoT is that it allows delegating the actual computation to an external Python interpreter, separating out the reasoning and language understanding tasks done by the language model from the complex math computations. 

The authors evaluate PoT on several math word problem and financial QA datasets, under both few-shot and zero-shot settings. Across the board, PoT outperforms CoT significantly, with average gains of around 8-15% in few-shot, and 12% in zero-shot. By combining PoT with self-consistency decoding, the authors are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on the math datasets, and near state-of-the-art on the financial QA datasets. The results demonstrate that PoT elicits stronger reasoning capabilities from language models by allowing them to express thoughts as programs rather than just text. This represents an important advance in using language models for complex numerical reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called 'Program of Thoughts' (PoT) to solve numerical reasoning tasks using large language models. The key idea is to have the language model generate Python code representing the reasoning steps, rather than just text explanations like in the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) method. 

The Python code expresses the reasoning as a multi-step program, with meaningful variable names to help ground it in natural language. For example, unknown variables like interest rate are introduced, equations are built up relating them, and then a Python library like SymPy is used to solve for the variables. This allows complex computations like solving equations to be offloaded to the Python interpreter, while still eliciting the reasoning steps from the language model.

PoT is evaluated on several math word problem and financial QA datasets. It outperforms CoT significantly on all datasets, with especially large gains on problems requiring more complex computations. PoT combined with sampling techniques like self-consistency decoding achieves state-of-the-art results on the math datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness at eliciting numerical reasoning abilities from language models while keeping the required computations accurate.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points about the problem addressed in this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new method called "Program of Thoughts" (PoT) for teaching language models to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. 

- Existing methods like "chain of thoughts" (CoT) prompting have language models produce natural language text to describe the reasoning steps and do the math computations. However, language models have limitations in accurately solving complex math expressions.

- PoT allows language models to produce Python code representing the reasoning steps, while delegating the computation to an external Python interpreter. This decouples reasoning from computation.

- The paper evaluates PoT on several math word problem and financial QA datasets. It aims to show PoT's effectiveness in improving reasoning and calculation accuracy compared to CoT across these diverse tasks.

In summary, the key problem is finding better ways to elicit language models' reasoning capabilities for numerical tasks, while overcoming their limitations in complex math computations. PoT delegates the math to Python code and achieves stronger results than existing CoT prompting approaches that rely solely on language generation.
