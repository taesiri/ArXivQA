# Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning   for Numerical Reasoning Tasks

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we disentangle computation from reasoning when teaching language models to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks?In particular, the paper proposes an approach called "Program of Thoughts" (PoT) that allows language models to generate programs expressing reasoning steps, while delegating the actual computation to an interpreter. This allows decoupling complex computation from language understanding and reasoning. The key hypothesis is that by separating out the computation component, PoT will be more effective at eliciting language models' reasoning capabilities compared to having the model perform both reasoning and computation (as in the Chain of Thoughts or CoT approach).The paper evaluates this hypothesis by testing PoT on several math word problem and financial QA datasets. The main findings are that PoT outperforms CoT significantly, with average gains of around 12% across the datasets. This supports the hypothesis that disentangling reasoning from computation leads to better reasoning performance from language models.In summary, the core research question is how to elicit better reasoning from language models by separating out the computation component. PoT is proposed as a method to test this hypothesis, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness versus an integrated reasoning+computation approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing "Program of Thoughts" (PoT) prompting, which uses language models to generate programs that express reasoning steps for solving numerical reasoning tasks. The key ideas are:- PoT generates programs instead of just text explanations. This allows delegating complex computations to an interpreter, decoupling computation from reasoning. - PoT aims to elicit "thoughtful" programs from language models by using semantic variable names and breaking reasoning into multiple steps.- PoT is evaluated on a diverse set of math word problem and financial QA datasets. It significantly outperforms prior work like Chain of Thoughts prompting across both few-shot and zero-shot settings.- PoT combined with self-consistency decoding achieves new state-of-the-art results on several benchmark math reasoning datasets.In summary, the main contribution is presenting PoT as an effective method for numerical reasoning that disentangles reasoning and computation. By generating "programs of thoughts", PoT takes better advantage of language models' reasoning capabilities while outsourcing complex computations. The broad experiments demonstrate the general applicability and strong performance of PoT.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes using language models to generate "programs of thoughts" expressing reasoning steps for solving complex numerical reasoning tasks, with computation offloaded to an interpreter, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several math and financial QA datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper proposes a new method called "Program of Thoughts" (PoT) for teaching language models to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. The key idea is to have the model generate Python code representing the reasoning steps, rather than just natural language rationales as in prior "Chain of Thoughts" (CoT) approaches. - The separation of reasoning and computation is a novel aspect of PoT compared to prior work. By having an external Python interpreter execute the generated code, PoT offloads the complex computations from the language model and focuses it just on reasoning/understanding.- The paper conducts experiments across several math word problem and financial QA datasets. The results show PoT outperforms CoT significantly, especially on more complex problems involving large numbers, equations, iteration etc. This demonstrates the benefits of PoT's approach.- PoT combined with self-consistency decoding achieves state-of-the-art results on the math datasets, surpassing prior CoT results. On financial QA, PoT obtains near state-of-the-art performance.- Compared to other concurrent work like LiLA that focuses on dataset assembly, this paper provides a thorough investigation into how to elicit reasoning from LLMs via "thoughtful" program generation. The zero-shot experiments also show the potential to generalize without dataset-specific examples.- Overall, PoT presents a novel prompting technique for numerical reasoning that advanced the state-of-the-art by decoupling reasoning and computation in an interpretable and accurate way. The comprehensive experiments and ablation studies provide useful insights into this approach.
