# [M3: A Multi-Task Mixed-Objective Learning Framework for Open-Domain   Multi-Hop Dense Sentence Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14074)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current dense retrieval models rely solely on contrastive learning objectives, which can lead to suboptimal text representations and hurt retrieval performance. 
- Combining multiple learning objectives (e.g. contrastive, classification) efficiently in a multi-task learning framework is challenging.
- Document-level retrieval can cause representation conflicts when documents consist of multiple distinct sentences.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an advanced recursive multi-hop dense \textbf{sentence} retrieval system called \textbf{M3}.
- Propose a novel dense sentence representation learning method (\textbf{M3-DSR}) based on:
  - Multi-task learning framework combining contrastive and classification objectives.
  - Mixed-objective learning framework to combine multiple datasets and objectives.
- Build an iterative retrieve-and-rerank pipeline to do multi-hop retrieval.
- Introduce a heuristic hybrid ranking algorithm to combine single-hop and multi-hop retrieval results.

Main Contributions:
- M3 achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop retrieval on the FEVER dataset, for both sentence-level and document-level evidence.
- M3-DSR gives much better retrieval recall compared to strong baselines like BM25 and DPR.
- The multi-task and mixed-objective learning frameworks are shown to improve representation learning.
- The hybrid ranking algorithm substantially boosts overall retrieval performance. 
- An end-to-end fact verification system based on M3 also reaches top results on the FEVER dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces M3, an advanced recursive multi-hop dense sentence retrieval system for fact verification that achieves state-of-the-art performance through a novel dense sentence representation learning method based on multi-task and mixed-objective learning as well as an efficient heuristic algorithm for combining single-hop and multi-hop evidence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting an advanced recursive multi-hop dense sentence retrieval system (M3) that achieves state-of-the-art multi-hop retrieval performance on the FEVER dataset.

2. Proposing a novel dense sentence representation learning method (M3-DSR) based on multi-task learning and mixed-objective learning frameworks that significantly outperforms strong baselines on sentence-level retrieval. 

3. Introducing an efficient heuristic hybrid ranking algorithm for combining retrieved single-hop and multi-hop sentence evidence, which shows substantial improvements over previous methods.

4. Developing an end-to-end multi-hop fact verification system based on M3 that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FEVER dataset.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting the full M3 system for multi-hop fact verification, including the advanced retrieval component as well as the end-to-end verification pipeline. The novel multi-task and mixed-objective learning approach for dense sentence representations is also a key contribution.

- Information retrieval

The paper introduces M3, which is an advanced recursive multi-hop dense sentence retrieval system for open-domain fact verification. The key aspects of M3 include using multi-task and mixed-objective learning to learn better dense text representations, retrieving evidence sentences instead of passages/documents, a novel hybrid ranking algorithm, and achieving state-of-the-art results on the FEVER benchmark. So the keywords reflect these main contributions and topics covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new multi-hop dense sentence retrieval system called M3. What are the key components of M3 and how do they work together in the overall pipeline?

2. A core contribution of this paper is a new dense sentence representation learning method called M3-DSR. Can you explain in detail how M3-DSR works, including the multi-task and mixed-objective learning frameworks? 

3. The paper mentions issues with current dense retrieval methods relying solely on contrastive learning objectives. What are these issues and how does M3-DSR address them through multi-task, mixed-objective learning?

4. What datasets are used to train the dense sentence encoders in M3-DSR? Why is the mixed-objective learning framework helpful for making use of different datasets and objectives? 

5. After dense sentence retrieval, the paper proposes adding a sentence reranking step. How is the sentence reranking model trained and how does it rescore the retrieved sentences?

6. Once single-hop retrieval results are obtained, the paper introduces a multi-hop retrieval process. Explain how iterative dense sentence retrieval is performed in M3 and how the query is updated at each hop.

7. For combining single-hop and multi-hop retrieval results, the paper proposes a novel hybrid ranking algorithm. Can you walk through how this algorithm works? What are its advantages?

8. What conclusions does the paper draw from the ablation studies about the effects of multi-task learning ratios, mixed-objective learning, negative sampling, etc.?

9. The full M3 pipeline is evaluated on the FEVER dataset. What metrics are used and how does M3 compare to previous state-of-the-art methods? 

10. What are some limitations of the proposed M3 model? Can you suggest any potential improvements that can be explored in future work?
