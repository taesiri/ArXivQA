# [A Dual Convolutional Neural Network Pipeline for Melanoma Diagnostics   and Prognostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08766)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a pipeline with two convolutional neural networks for melanoma detection and prognosis prediction from whole slide images. The first model identifies malignant regions and provides a patient-level diagnosis of benign or melanoma. It utilizes a VGG16 backbone pretrained on ImageNet with an added classifier and is trained on annotated patches from whole slide images. The diagnosis is determined by calculating the ratio of predicted malignant patches to total tissue patches. The second model takes the predicted malignant patches as input to predict patient prognosis as good or bad, using another VGG16 model trained on patches with prognosis labels. Experiments demonstrate promising performance - the prognosis model achieved an F1 score of 0.79 using automatically detected regions compared to 0.82 with manually annotated inputs. Further testing showed reasonably good diagnosis performance on new unlabeled data. However, the prognostic model overestimated poor outcomes, indicating more training data is needed. Overall this presents an encouraging pipeline for pathology image analysis and decision support.
