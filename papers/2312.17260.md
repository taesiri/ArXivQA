# [TimePillars: Temporally-Recurrent 3D LiDAR Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17260)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Single frame 3D object detection methods for LiDAR point clouds struggle with long-range detection (e.g. 200m) due to the inherent sparsity of LiDAR data. This long-range detection is critical for achieving safe automation in autonomous driving.
- Aggregating multiple LiDAR scans into denser point clouds improves detection but is computationally expensive and often problem-specific. 
- Many state-of-the-art methods use operations like sparse convolutions and attention that are not hardware efficient for deployment.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose TimePillars, a temporally recurrent 3D object detection pipeline using the pillar representation of point clouds.
- Uses a convolutional gated recurrent unit (convGRU) to model long-term temporal dependencies and memory.
- Performs ego-motion compensation of the convGRU hidden state features using a learned convolutional transformation guided by an auxiliary task.  
- Relies only on basic operations like 2D convolutions that can be efficiently run on target hardware like the Nvidia Orin.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a novel recurrent model for LiDAR based 3D object detection that respects hardware constraints.
- Demonstrate improved performance over baselines, especially at long range up to 200m using the Zenseact Open Dataset.
- Study placement of the recurrent module, demonstrating improved results when placed after the backbone.
- Validate the use of an auxiliary task for ego-motion compensation of the recurrent hidden state.
- Provide the first results and baseline for 3D object detection on the Zenseact Open Dataset.

In summary, the paper proposes TimePillars, an efficient temporally recurrent model for long-range 3D object detection in LiDAR point clouds suitable for autonomous driving systems.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel temporally-recurrent model, TimePillars, which solves the 3D LiDAR object detection task while respecting the set of supported operations on common target hardware.
