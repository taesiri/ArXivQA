# [Scene 3-D Reconstruction System in Scattering Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09005)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an improved underwater 3D reconstruction system that addresses issues with extensive training times and low rendering efficiency in existing methods. The system first enhances underwater video frames captured by a monocular camera to correct poor image quality caused by light scattering while ensuring consistency across frames. Next, keyframe selection optimizes resource utilization and eliminates dynamic object impact. The selected keyframes undergo pose estimation with COLMAP before a 3D reconstruction process using a neural radiance field (NeRF) method optimized by multi-resolution hash coding. This coding based on hash searches enables a small neural network to achieve comparable accuracy to a fully-connected network. The multi-resolution structure also facilitates GPU parallelism and reduces computation via hash conflict elimination. Experiments demonstrate superior image enhancement metrics over other methods and competitive quality and efficiency in reconstruction, with the system achieving high PSNR in about 1 minute compared to 7+ hours for a recently proposed technique. Limitations are the reliance on bitmap pose information which may prove challenging in some scenarios, and the enhancement approach not fully restoring color fidelity. In conclusion, the proposed system enables rapid, high-quality 3D reconstruction for underwater scenes to support applications in research, conservation, and tourism.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Reconstructing underwater 3D scenes using neural radiance fields (NeRF) is challenging due to extensive training times and inefficient rendering. Existing methods like Seathru-NERF face these limitations.  

Proposed Solution:
- An improved underwater 3D reconstruction system is proposed to address the above issues and enable rapid, high-quality reconstruction.

- Image Enhancement: Underwater video frames are enhanced to correct for poor image quality caused by light absorption/scattering in water. Enhancement ensures consistency across frames. 

- Keyframe Selection: Keyframes are selected from the enhanced video to optimize resources and eliminate impact of dynamic objects.

- 3D Reconstruction: An instant neural graphics primitives method is used for fast 3D reconstruction of the static keyframes. It uses a neural network with a multi-resolution hash table to enable efficient gradient-based optimization.

Main Contributions:
- A complete underwater scene reconstruction system combining image enhancement, keyframe selection and instant neural radiance field based 3D reconstruction.

- Enhanced consistency in image quality across video frames.

- Efficient keyframe filtering based on both pose and image sharpness.

- Significantly reduced 3D reconstruction time from hours to minutes with high quality.

- Superior image quality and faster reconstruction compared to prior arts like Seathru-NERF.

In summary, the paper proposes an optimized underwater 3D reconstruction system that achieves rapid and high-fidelity reconstruction results, overcoming limitations in existing methods. The integration of image enhancement, keyframe selection and instant neural radiance fields leads to the key contributions.
