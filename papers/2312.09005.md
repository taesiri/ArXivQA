# [Scene 3-D Reconstruction System in Scattering Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09005)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an improved underwater 3D reconstruction system that addresses issues with extensive training times and low rendering efficiency in existing methods. The system first enhances underwater video frames captured by a monocular camera to correct poor image quality caused by light scattering while ensuring consistency across frames. Next, keyframe selection optimizes resource utilization and eliminates dynamic object impact. The selected keyframes undergo pose estimation with COLMAP before a 3D reconstruction process using a neural radiance field (NeRF) method optimized by multi-resolution hash coding. This coding based on hash searches enables a small neural network to achieve comparable accuracy to a fully-connected network. The multi-resolution structure also facilitates GPU parallelism and reduces computation via hash conflict elimination. Experiments demonstrate superior image enhancement metrics over other methods and competitive quality and efficiency in reconstruction, with the system achieving high PSNR in about 1 minute compared to 7+ hours for a recently proposed technique. Limitations are the reliance on bitmap pose information which may prove challenging in some scenarios, and the enhancement approach not fully restoring color fidelity. In conclusion, the proposed system enables rapid, high-quality 3D reconstruction for underwater scenes to support applications in research, conservation, and tourism.
