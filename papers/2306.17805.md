# [Topologically Attributed Graphs for Shape Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17805)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can topological attributes be incorporated into graph-based shape representations to improve shape discrimination and classification?In particular, the paper proposes a novel approach for constructing attributed graphs that encode both global topological structure (via graph connectivity) as well as local topological features (via persistent homology attributes). The central hypothesis is that these topologically attributed graphs will lead to more discriminative and stable shape representations compared to using topological attributes or graph structure alone. The paper introduces mathematical frameworks, stability results, and computational methods to construct these attributed graphs from point cloud data. Experiments on shape classification tasks are presented to evaluate the discriminative power of the proposed representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- The introduction of a novel family of attributed graphs called Decorated Reeb Graphs (DRGs) for shape discrimination and representation. These graphs enrich topological graph constructions like Mapper with additional topological attributes like persistent homology.- Proving stability results for these DRG representations, showing that small perturbations in the input data lead to small changes in the DRG output. This helps provide a theoretical justification for using DRGs as shape representations.- Providing computational methods and experiments demonstrating how DRGs can be constructed from point cloud data and compared using metrics like Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. - Showing through classification experiments that DRGs can serve as effective shape representations when used as inputs to neural networks, achieving competitive results on shape classification compared to methods like PointNet.In summary, the main novelty seems to be in proposing these DRG structures which combine aspects of Mapper graphs and topological data analysis, and demonstrating their potential both theoretically through stability analysis and computationally through classification experiments. The overall contribution is introducing DRGs as a new technique for shape representation and discrimination.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading, this paper introduces a novel approach for representing shapes using attributed graphs enriched with topological information. Here are a few key points on how it relates to other work:- The idea of using topological data analysis and attributed graphs for shape representation builds on a large body of prior work. However, combining Mapper graphs with persistent homology attributions seems to be a new contribution.- Most prior work on topological shape representations has focused just on extracting a single topological signature, like a persistence diagram. Representing a shape via a graph of interrelated topological signatures is an interesting new direction.- There has been a lot of work on graph-based shape representations, but typically these graphs capture geometric rather than topological features. The idea of integrating topological information into graph-based shape representations appears novel. - For shape classification tasks, the literature contains many papers benchmarking topological and graph-based methods. This paper provides comparisons on a standard benchmark, showing competitive results, especially given the simplicity of the graph neural network model used.- The overall approach of integrating ideas from topological data analysis with graph neural networks seems to be gaining popularity recently. But the specific way this paper constructs topological graph representations and handles attributions appears different from prior work.In summary, while the individual components draw on established ideas, the particular way this paper combines Mapper graphs, persistent homology, and graph neural networks to represent shapes appears to be new and represents an interesting research direction. The results help validate the potential of this approach.
