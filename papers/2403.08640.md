# [Refractive COLMAP: Refractive Structure-from-Motion Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) are key technologies for 3D reconstruction and mapping from images. However, applying them underwater is challenging due to the refraction effects caused by the waterproof housings used to protect the cameras. Simply treating refraction effects as camera distortion leads to inaccurate reconstructions, especially for large-scale scenes. While progress has been made recently on refractive multi-view geometry, a complete, robust, general, and open-source solution for refractive SfM remains unavailable.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors integrate considerations of refraction throughout the entire SfM pipeline in the open-source framework COLMAP. They model generalized refractive systems with flat or dome ports using ray tracing techniques to handle refraction. Virtual perspective cameras are computed to replace refracted rays. For motion estimation, a minimal solver is used for absolute pose and a simplification strategy based on approximated perspective cameras is proposed for relative pose. The rest of the SfM pipeline like triangulation and bundle adjustment is modified to operate on the virtual cameras while allowing refractive parameters to be jointly optimized.

Main Contributions:

1) Refraction integrated throughout COLMAP supporting generalized refractive systems and auto-refinement of parameters

2) Robust relative pose estimation approach for geometric verification and SfM initialization

3) Extensive evaluations demonstrating accuracy, robustness and applicability to large-scale reconstruction of the overall refractive SfM pipeline

4) Open-source implementation of the system

The evaluations include numerical simulations, experiments on realistically rendered images with ground truth, and real-world reconstruction. Comparisons to ignoring refraction and using only intrinsic calibration show advantages of the refractive SfM approach in terms of accuracy. The system is proven capable of handling thousands of images for large-scale reconstructions.
