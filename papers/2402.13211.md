# [Can Large Language Models be Good Emotional Supporter? Mitigating   Preference Bias on Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate emotional distress through dialogue. However, providing effective emotional support is complex and challenging even for humans. 
- Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) for ESC, but LLMs struggle with accurately selecting appropriate conversational strategies for providing emotional support. 

- This paper performs an in-depth analysis of LLMs' abilities on the ESConv ESC dataset, revealing two key issues:
   1) LLMs lack proficiency in predicting the correct strategy.
   2) LLMs exhibit preference bias, strongly preferring certain strategies over others.

- The authors identify preference bias as a key factor hindering LLMs' effectiveness in robustly providing emotional support across different stages of a conversation. 

Solution and Contributions:

- The paper systematically analyzes the proficiency and preferences of various LLMs on ESC strategy prediction. A suite of new metrics focused on strategies are proposed: proficiency, preference and preference bias.

- The study reveals that high preference bias exacerbates difficulties in less preferred stages of ESC, increasing poor quality responses. Hence mitigating preference bias is critical for LLMs to become good emotional supporters.

- The paper shows that similar to humans, LLMs align with psychological contact hypothesis - external assistance helps reduce preference bias which LLMs cannot alleviate themselves via self-reflection.

- Comprehensive human evaluations using tailored criteria demonstrate the benefits of mitigating preference bias - improved emotional support quality and significantly fewer poor responses.

- Key conclusions are that that preference bias hinders progress in ESC, while external interventions help address it. The findings provide insights into developing LLMs' emotional intelligence.

In summary, this paper performs an in-depth strategy-centric analysis of challenges faced by LLMs for ESC, revealing preference bias as a key hindrance. It further provides methodological insights and human evaluations towards addressing preference bias to improve emotional support provision abilities of LLMs.
