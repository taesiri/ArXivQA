# [Can Large Language Models be Good Emotional Supporter? Mitigating   Preference Bias on Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate emotional distress through dialogue. However, providing effective emotional support is complex and challenging even for humans. 
- Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) for ESC, but LLMs struggle with accurately selecting appropriate conversational strategies for providing emotional support. 

- This paper performs an in-depth analysis of LLMs' abilities on the ESConv ESC dataset, revealing two key issues:
   1) LLMs lack proficiency in predicting the correct strategy.
   2) LLMs exhibit preference bias, strongly preferring certain strategies over others.

- The authors identify preference bias as a key factor hindering LLMs' effectiveness in robustly providing emotional support across different stages of a conversation. 

Solution and Contributions:

- The paper systematically analyzes the proficiency and preferences of various LLMs on ESC strategy prediction. A suite of new metrics focused on strategies are proposed: proficiency, preference and preference bias.

- The study reveals that high preference bias exacerbates difficulties in less preferred stages of ESC, increasing poor quality responses. Hence mitigating preference bias is critical for LLMs to become good emotional supporters.

- The paper shows that similar to humans, LLMs align with psychological contact hypothesis - external assistance helps reduce preference bias which LLMs cannot alleviate themselves via self-reflection.

- Comprehensive human evaluations using tailored criteria demonstrate the benefits of mitigating preference bias - improved emotional support quality and significantly fewer poor responses.

- Key conclusions are that that preference bias hinders progress in ESC, while external interventions help address it. The findings provide insights into developing LLMs' emotional intelligence.

In summary, this paper performs an in-depth strategy-centric analysis of challenges faced by LLMs for ESC, revealing preference bias as a key hindrance. It further provides methodological insights and human evaluations towards addressing preference bias to improve emotional support provision abilities of LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the struggle of large language models in providing emotional support, revealing challenges in selecting the correct strategy and a preference bias, and emphasizes the importance of mitigating this preference bias to enhance robustness across stages of emotional support for reducing poor-quality responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper introduces that a wide range of large language models (LLMs) exhibit different preferences for emotional support strategies.

2) The paper proposes a new suite of metrics focused on strategies - proficiency, preference, and preference bias - to analyze LLMs' capabilities in providing emotional support. 

3) The paper emphasizes the crucial role of preference bias in enabling LLMs to robustly provide effective emotional support across different stages. Models with high preference bias struggle in some stages.

4) The paper shows that LLMs align with the psychological Contact Hypothesis, indicating that external assistance is necessary to help address preference bias. 

5) Through extensive human evaluation, the paper demonstrates that mitigating preference bias is key to decreasing the proportion of poor-quality responses and enabling effective emotional support from LLMs.

In summary, the main contribution is highlighting the importance of preference bias in LLMs for providing robust and helpful emotional support across different situations, and showing that external assistance is needed to address this. The paper provides insights into how to improve LLMs' capabilities as emotional support conversationalists.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Emotional support conversation (ESC)
- Large language models (LLMs) 
- Support strategies
- Exploration, comforting, and action stages
- Preference bias
- Proficiency
- Robustness
- Contact hypothesis
- Poor-quality responses
- Seeker's satisfaction

The paper analyzes the performance of LLMs on an emotional support conversation dataset, with a focus on their ability to select appropriate support strategies. It introduces metrics to quantify the models' proficiency, preference bias, and robustness in predicting strategies across different stages of a conversation. A key finding is that mitigating preference bias, through external assistance based on the contact hypothesis, can enhance the quality and consistency of emotional support responses. The paper also proposes evaluation criteria centered on seeker's satisfaction to assess if responses provide helpful support. Overall, it provides insights into limitations of LLMs as emotional supporters and promising directions to enhance their capabilities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper applies the Contact Hypothesis to language models to mitigate preference bias. What are some limitations or caveats of using this psychological theory in the context of language models? How could it be further adapted?

2. External assistance seems crucial for reducing preference bias in language models according to the results. What other potential sources of external assistance could be explored beyond a separate strategy prediction model and expanding prompt examples? 

3. The authors construct specific test sets for the exploration, comforting, and action stages. What impact could the distribution of strategies in these test sets have on assessing model preference and robustness? How could the test sets be further improved?

4. What other metrics beyond proficiency, preference, and preference bias could give more insight into a model's ability to provide emotional support across diverse situations? Are there better ways to quantify these attributes?  

5. The paper emphasizes lower preference bias enables more robust performance across emotional support stages. But could higher bias potentially be beneficial if aligned with stages the model excels at? How could this trade-off be further analyzed?

6. The human evaluation results validate that lower preference bias improves emotional support quality. But what other subjective or objective criteria could complement the current metrics to better measure real-world viability?

7. How do the limitations acknowledged in the paper like alignment issues between strategies and responses impact the conclusions made about preference bias? How could misalignment be accounted for?  

8. What architectural properties of different language models correlate with higher or lower preference bias? Could these properties be adjusted to directly reduce bias during model development?

9. The authors use a trained strategy prediction model for external assistance. What alternative methods could reduce the need for a separate prediction model while still providing useful external signals?

10. Beyond emotional support conversations, what other dialogue tasks could benefit from analyzing and reducing preference bias? How could the methodology generalize?
