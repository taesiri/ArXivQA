# [A Challenging Multimodal Video Summary: Simultaneously Extracting and   Generating Keyframe-Caption Pairs from Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01575)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new multimodal video summarization task called Multi-VidSum which involves extracting a predefined number of keyframe-caption pairs that effectively summarize the content of a given video. The key challenges include the need to simultaneously optimize keyframe selection and caption generation by accounting for their interdependencies. To facilitate research on this task, the authors construct a large-scale dataset by expanding the ActivityNet Captions dataset with additional crowdsourced keyframe annotations. They also develop new evaluation metrics tailored for this task. Two baseline systems are presented - an iterative refinement model that alternates between keyframe selection and caption generation, and a simul-determination model that handles both jointly. Comparative analysis shows better performance for the simul-determination model, highlighting the importance of capturing inter-modal dependencies. The new dataset and task provide a practical testbed to advance multimodal video summarization techniques.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is increasing demand for practical video summarization systems to help people efficiently comprehend video content. 
- Existing methods have limitations in terms of the datasets, models, and evaluation used.
- The paper proposes a new challenging and practical "Multi-VidSum" task which involves summarizing a video into a predefined number of keyframe-caption pairs. This requires simultaneously selecting important keyframes and generating captions that describe them.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulates the Multi-VidSum task definition, metrics for evaluation, and constructs a large dataset by expanding the ActivityNet Captions dataset with additional keyframe annotations.
- Proposes two baseline systems:
   - Iterative Refinement Model: Alternates between keyframe selection and caption generation modules.
   - Simul-Determination Model: Generates all keyframes and captions simultaneously using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.
- Compares performance of the baselines using multiple evaluation metrics for both keyframe selection and caption quality.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the new Multi-VidSum task for multimodal video summarization.
- Constructs a large-scale dataset for the task with keyframe annotations.
- Develops evaluation metrics and baseline systems to benchmark performance.
- Provides analysis comparing the baselines and impact of using different pretrained image captioning models.
- The task and dataset enable further research into simultaneously handling keyframe selection and caption generation.

In summary, the paper presents a practical video summarization task, accompanying dataset, evaluation framework and baseline systems to facilitate research into this challenging multimodal problem.
