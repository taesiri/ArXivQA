# [A Challenging Multimodal Video Summary: Simultaneously Extracting and   Generating Keyframe-Caption Pairs from Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01575)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new multimodal video summarization task called Multi-VidSum which involves extracting a predefined number of keyframe-caption pairs that effectively summarize the content of a given video. The key challenges include the need to simultaneously optimize keyframe selection and caption generation by accounting for their interdependencies. To facilitate research on this task, the authors construct a large-scale dataset by expanding the ActivityNet Captions dataset with additional crowdsourced keyframe annotations. They also develop new evaluation metrics tailored for this task. Two baseline systems are presented - an iterative refinement model that alternates between keyframe selection and caption generation, and a simul-determination model that handles both jointly. Comparative analysis shows better performance for the simul-determination model, highlighting the importance of capturing inter-modal dependencies. The new dataset and task provide a practical testbed to advance multimodal video summarization techniques.
