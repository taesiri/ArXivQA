# [Inferring Hybrid Neural Fluid Fields from Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06561)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes HyFluid, a neural approach to jointly infer fluid density and velocity fields from sparse multi-view videos. The key ideas are: (1) Using physics-based losses, including a density loss, projection loss, and laminar regularization loss, to enforce recovering a physically plausible fluid flow that transports density over time and is divergence-free. (2) A hybrid neural velocity representation that decomposes the velocity into a base neural velocity field capturing irrotational flow and vortex particles capturing residual turbulent flow. This allows modeling complex turbulent flows. HyFluid is shown to enable high-fidelity recovery of density and velocity from videos, supporting novel view synthesis, re-simulation, future prediction, and editing. Compared to prior neural reconstruction methods, HyFluid demonstrates more accurate and detailed velocity and density estimation. The simple yet effective designs open up new possibilities for learning-based reconstruction and composition of fluid scenes.
