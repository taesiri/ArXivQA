# [Inferring Hybrid Neural Fluid Fields from Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Inferring Hybrid Neural Fluid Fields from Videos":

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of recovering fluid density and velocity fields from sparse multi-view video observations of fluids. This is challenging because (1) fluid velocity is ambiguous from visual observations since fluids lack stable visual features, (2) fluid flows exhibit turbulent features across multiple spatial scales which is difficult for a single neural representation to capture, and (3) reconstructing continuous 3D density fields from 2D observations is an ill-posed problem.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Hybrid Neural Fluid Fields (HyFluid), a neural approach to jointly infer plausible fluid density and velocity fields from videos. The key ideas are:

(1) Physics-based losses: Enforce constraints from fluid dynamics equations, including (a) density loss: velocity should transport density over time, (b) projection loss: velocity should be divergence-free, (c) laminar regularization loss.

(2) Hybrid velocity representation: Decompose velocity into (a) a base neural velocity field that captures smooth flows, and (b) a vortex particle-based velocity field that captures residual turbulent details.

(3) Joint training: Leverage both visual signals via differentiable volume rendering and physical constraints to infer density and velocity.

Main Contributions:
1. A neural approach to uncover plausible fluid density and velocity from sparse multi-view videos of fluids.

2. Simple yet effective physics-based losses and hybrid neural velocity representation to address inherent ambiguity and complexity of real-world fluid flows.

3. Evaluation on tasks like novel view synthesis, re-simulation and future prediction shows HyFluid enables high-fidelity recovery of fluid fields and supports applications in graphics and vision.
