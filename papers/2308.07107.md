## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper provides a survey of recent research on applying large language models (LLMs) to information retrieval (IR) systems. The first paragraph summarizes the background and motivation. Information retrieval systems like search engines are crucial for accessing information, but face challenges like query ambiguity and retrieval efficiency. Recent advances in neural network models, specifically large language models like GPT-3, provide new opportunities to address these challenges and enhance IR systems in areas like query rewriting, retrieval, reranking, and reading/summarization. LLMs have impressive capabilities in language understanding, generation, reasoning, and generalization that can be leveraged. The second paragraph summarizes the key contributions. The paper comprehensively reviews approaches to integrating LLMs into the various modules of IR systems. For query rewriting, LLMs can expand and disambiguate queries using their broad knowledge and semantic understanding. For retrieval, LLMs can better match queries and documents based on semantics. For reranking results, LLMs can capture linguistic nuances for finer-grained ordering. For reading/summarization, LLMs can generate passages summarizing retrieved documents rather than just returning a list. The paper discusses strategies like prompting and fine-tuning LLMs for these applications. It also analyzes limitations and promising future directions as this research area continues to rapidly evolve. Overall, the integration of LLMs has transformative potential to enhance IR systems through more advanced linguistic capabilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework called LLMCS that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance query understanding in conversational search. The key idea is to prompt the LLMs to generate multiple types of outputs that complement each other to capture the complete user search intent, including concise query rewrites, longer hypothetical system responses, and human demonstrations. Specifically, the framework first retrieves candidate passages using the original user query. Then it feeds the query, context passages, and human demonstrations to the LLM and instructs it to generate query rewrites and hypothetical responses from multiple perspectives. For example, the LLM generates a query rewrite, a clarifying question, and a hypothetical answer passage. The framework repeats this process for different formulations of the prompt to elicit diverse outputs. Finally, an aggregation module combines the generated query rewrites and responses into a unified representation, which is used by the retriever to perform document retrieval. This approach allows the LLM to leverage its strong language understanding capability to analyze search intent from different angles, overcoming the limitations of using only the original user query. Experiments on two datasets show that LLMCS outperforms baselines by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-perspective search intent modeling.
