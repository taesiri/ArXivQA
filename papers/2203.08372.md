# [Multi-View Document Representation Learning for Open-Domain Dense   Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08372)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn multi-view representations of documents for open-domain dense retrieval. 

Specifically, the paper aims to address the limitation of existing dense retrievers that represent documents as a single vector, which makes it difficult to match multi-view queries. The key research question is how to effectively generate multiple embeddings for documents that can align with different potential queries.

The main hypothesis is that learning multi-view document representations through multiple "viewers" and optimizing them with a proposed global-local loss will enable the model to produce embeddings that capture diverse semantic meanings and better match different queries.

In summary, the key research question is how to produce multi-view document representations to overcome the limitation of single vector representations in matching multi-view queries for open-domain dense retrieval. The central hypothesis is that the proposed multi-viewer architecture and training approach can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-view document representation learning framework (MVR) to produce multiple embeddings that can better match different queries for the same document. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing a simple yet effective method to generate multi-view document representations through multiple "viewer" tokens. This captures different semantic aspects of a document.

- Introducing a global-local loss with annealed temperature to optimize the training of the multiple viewers. The global loss does contrastive learning between queries and documents. The local loss enforces uniformity among the multiple viewer embeddings. The annealed temperature helps activate more diverse viewer embeddings. 

- Achieving state-of-the-art retrieval results on several open-domain QA datasets like SQuAD, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

- Analyzing the multi-view embeddings and showing they capture more diverse semantics compared to baseline methods like ME-BERT. Also showing the retrieval quality improvements over methods like DPR through qualitative examples.

Overall, the main contribution is presenting an effective framework to learn multi-view document representations to better match the diversity of potential queries, instead of being limited to a single vector representation. The experiments, analysis, and results demonstrate the benefits of this approach.

- The global-local loss with annealed temperature is a new training technique tailored for optimizing the multi-view embeddings. It helps differentiate the views while maintaining uniformity.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on multiple open-domain retrieval benchmarks like Natural Questions and TriviaQA. The gains are especially large on SQuAD which has more multi-view queries per document.

- Analysis provides insights into the superiority of multi-view over single vector and shows the embeddings are more diverse. The components of the approach are ablated to validate their contributions.

Overall, this paper makes significant advances over prior work by addressing the multi-view representation problem through a novel yet simple framework with specialized training techniques. Both empirical and analytical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. It helps advance the state-of-the-art in dense retrieval.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions at the end of the paper:

- Exploring other methods for generating multi-view document representations besides using multiple viewer tokens. They mention hierarchical models as a potential approach.

- Combining their approach with other strategies like hard negative mining, knowledge distillation, and pre-training to further improve performance. Their method is orthogonal and complementary to these other techniques.

- Extending their framework to cross-encoder architectures and studying the impact.

- Evaluating their method on other information retrieval tasks beyond open-domain retrieval, such as conversational search.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-view document representation learning framework called MVR for open-domain dense retrieval. Traditional dense retrievers like bi-encoders are limited to a single vector representation of documents, while documents often contain diverse semantics and can answer multiple potential queries from different views. MVR generates multiple embeddings for documents through multiple "viewer" tokens to capture multi-view semantics. It optimizes the training of viewers with a global-local loss and annealed temperature to encourage the viewers to align with different queries. Experiments on open-domain QA datasets show MVR achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance compared to methods like DPR, ANCE, RocketQA, and DRPQ. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of the multi-view representations and training strategies. Overall, MVR provides a simple yet effective approach to learn multi-view document representations for improved open-domain dense retrieval.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the main ideas in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Multi-View Representation Learning framework (MVR) for open-domain dense retrieval. Traditional dense retrieval methods use a bi-encoder architecture which represents queries and documents as single vectors. However, documents often contain multiple semantic meanings and can answer different queries from various perspectives. To address this, MVR generates multiple vector representations of documents through multiple "viewer" tokens. It also uses a global-local loss function with annealed temperature to encourage the viewer vectors to align with different potential queries. 

Experiments on open-domain QA datasets including SQuAD, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA show MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance. It outperforms methods like DPR and DRPQ which also aim to improve document representation. Further analysis indicates the multi-viewer representations capture more fine-grained semantics compared to single vector retrieval models. The global-local loss and annealed temperature help prevent viewer vectors from collapsing. Overall, MVR provides an effective framework to learn multi-view document representations for dense retrieval.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method proposed in the paper:

The paper proposes a Multi-View document Representation learning (MVR) framework for improving dense passage retrieval. The key idea is to generate multiple embedding representations for each document through multiple "viewer" tokens, rather than just using a single vector like standard bi-encoders. This allows the model to capture different semantic aspects of a document that could match different potential queries. To train the multi-view representations, they propose a global-local loss function. The global loss is a standard contrastive loss between positives and negatives. The local loss enforces uniformity between the multiple document embeddings for each sample, preventing them from collapsing to the same vector. They also use an annealed temperature in the loss to help activate more distinct viewer embeddings during training. Experiments on several retrieval datasets show MVR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Analysis confirms the multi-view embeddings are more diverse and match different queries better compared to baseline models. Overall, the proposed framework provides a simple but effective approach to produce and optimize multi-view document representations for improved dense retrieval.
