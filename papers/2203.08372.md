# [Multi-View Document Representation Learning for Open-Domain Dense   Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08372)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn multi-view representations of documents for open-domain dense retrieval. Specifically, the paper aims to address the limitation of existing dense retrievers that represent documents as a single vector, which makes it difficult to match multi-view queries. The key research question is how to effectively generate multiple embeddings for documents that can align with different potential queries.The main hypothesis is that learning multi-view document representations through multiple "viewers" and optimizing them with a proposed global-local loss will enable the model to produce embeddings that capture diverse semantic meanings and better match different queries.In summary, the key research question is how to produce multi-view document representations to overcome the limitation of single vector representations in matching multi-view queries for open-domain dense retrieval. The central hypothesis is that the proposed multi-viewer architecture and training approach can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-view document representation learning framework (MVR) to produce multiple embeddings that can better match different queries for the same document. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing a simple yet effective method to generate multi-view document representations through multiple "viewer" tokens. This captures different semantic aspects of a document.- Introducing a global-local loss with annealed temperature to optimize the training of the multiple viewers. The global loss does contrastive learning between queries and documents. The local loss enforces uniformity among the multiple viewer embeddings. The annealed temperature helps activate more diverse viewer embeddings. - Achieving state-of-the-art retrieval results on several open-domain QA datasets like SQuAD, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.- Analyzing the multi-view embeddings and showing they capture more diverse semantics compared to baseline methods like ME-BERT. Also showing the retrieval quality improvements over methods like DPR through qualitative examples.Overall, the main contribution is presenting an effective framework to learn multi-view document representations to better match the diversity of potential queries, instead of being limited to a single vector representation. The experiments, analysis, and results demonstrate the benefits of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a multi-view document representation learning framework called MVR that generates multiple embeddings for documents through viewers and uses a global-local loss with annealed temperature to optimize training so the multiple viewers align better with different queries.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on dense retrieval:- It proposes a multi-view document representation learning framework (MVR) to address the issue of a document corresponding to multiple potential queries. Most prior work uses a single vector to represent a document, which can cause semantic mismatch with multi-view queries. The multi-view approach is novel.- The method of generating multi-view embeddings through "viewers" is simple and effective compared to more complex aggregators like in Poly-Encoder and DRPQ. It can also be directly deployed for efficient retrieval unlike those attention-based models.- The global-local loss with annealed temperature is a new training technique tailored for optimizing the multi-view embeddings. It helps differentiate the views while maintaining uniformity.- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on multiple open-domain retrieval benchmarks like Natural Questions and TriviaQA. The gains are especially large on SQuAD which has more multi-view queries per document.- Analysis provides insights into the superiority of multi-view over single vector and shows the embeddings are more diverse. The components of the approach are ablated to validate their contributions.Overall, this paper makes significant advances over prior work by addressing the multi-view representation problem through a novel yet simple framework with specialized training techniques. Both empirical and analytical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. It helps advance the state-of-the-art in dense retrieval.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few future research directions at the end of the paper:- Exploring other methods for generating multi-view document representations besides using multiple viewer tokens. They mention hierarchical models as a potential approach.- Combining their approach with other strategies like hard negative mining, knowledge distillation, and pre-training to further improve performance. Their method is orthogonal and complementary to these other techniques.- Extending their framework to cross-encoder architectures and studying the impact.- Evaluating their method on other information retrieval tasks beyond open-domain retrieval, such as conversational search.- Studying how to dynamically determine the optimal number of views per document rather than using a fixed hyperparameter.- Analyzing the semantic meaning and relationships between the learned multi-view embeddings.In summary, the main future directions are exploring other techniques for multi-view representation learning, combining it with existing strategies to improve retrieval, applying it to other tasks and settings, and better understanding the resulting embeddings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a multi-view document representation learning framework called MVR for open-domain dense retrieval. Traditional dense retrievers like bi-encoders are limited to a single vector representation of documents, while documents often contain diverse semantics and can answer multiple potential queries from different views. MVR generates multiple embeddings for documents through multiple "viewer" tokens to capture multi-view semantics. It optimizes the training of viewers with a global-local loss and annealed temperature to encourage the viewers to align with different queries. Experiments on open-domain QA datasets show MVR achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance compared to methods like DPR, ANCE, RocketQA, and DRPQ. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of the multi-view representations and training strategies. Overall, MVR provides a simple yet effective approach to learn multi-view document representations for improved open-domain dense retrieval.
