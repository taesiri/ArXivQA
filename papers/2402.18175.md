# [Self-Supervised Spatially Variant PSF Estimation for Aberration-Aware   Depth-from-Defocus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18175)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing depth-from-defocus (DfD) methods often assume spatially invariant point spread functions (PSFs) for simplicity, but this assumption is invalid for real cameras with aberrations and distortions. Using inaccurate PSF models leads to poor performance of learning-based DfD methods. Estimating spatially variant PSFs of a real camera is challenging without ground-truth PSFs or precise image alignments.

Proposed Solution: A self-supervised learning approach to estimate spatially variant PSFs of a real camera from easy-to-obtain pairs of real sharp and blurred images. Introduce a polar coordinate PSF representation to model rotationally symmetric PSFs for more efficient learning. Also provide image height (IH) map as input to DfD network to consider spatial PSF variance.

Key Contributions:
- Self-supervised method to estimate spatially variant PSFs for a real camera without requiring ground-truth PSFs or precise image alignment.
- Polar coordinate PSF model assuming rotation symmetry enables more accurate and data-efficient PSF estimation. 
- IH map input to DfD network allows learning depth maps considering spatial variance of PSFs.
- Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate improved performance of both PSF estimation and depth estimation compared to existing methods.

In summary, this paper proposes a practical solution to obtain spatially variant PSFs of a real camera and use them to train an aberration-aware DfD network for improved depth estimation performance. The self-supervised setting and efficient PSF representation are the main strengths of this work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-supervised learning method to estimate spatially variant point spread functions for aberration-aware depth-from-defocus by using pairs of real sharp and blurred images captured by changing camera settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel self-supervised learning method for estimating spatially variant point spread functions (PSFs) of a real camera. Specifically:

- They propose a self-supervised PSF estimation network (PSF-Net) that is trained on pairs of real sharp and blurred images captured by changing the camera's aperture. This eliminates the need for ground-truth PSFs or precise image alignment.

- They introduce a polar coordinate PSF model to represent rotationally symmetric PSFs, which vary along the image height. This allows more efficient learning compared to estimating a full PSF for every pixel.

- The PSF-Net can handle the focus breathing effect, where the field of view changes slightly across focus distances, by estimating properly shifted PSFs for each focus distance. 

- They use the estimated spatially variant PSFs to generate synthetic training data for depth-from-defocus (DfD) networks. By providing the image height as input, the DfD networks learn to estimate depth maps considering the spatial PSF variations.

- Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness for both PSF estimation and depth estimation.

The paper proposes a self-supervised learning method to estimate spatially variant PSFs of a real camera, which are then used to train an aberration-aware depth-from-defocus (DfD) network. Key aspects include modeling PSFs in a polar coordinate system to incorporate rotational symmetry, handling focus breathing effects, and providing an image height map as input to the DfD network to consider spatial PSF variations. The goal is to improve DfD by accounting for aberrations and non-ideal optics in real camera systems.
