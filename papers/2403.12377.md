# [Online Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery with Task Deadlines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12377)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of multi-agent pickup and delivery with task deadlines (MAPD-D). This is an extension of the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem by incorporating delivery deadlines for tasks. Specifically, it considers an online version where new tasks can arrive dynamically at any time. Satisfying the deadlines is crucial for operational efficiency in applications like automated warehouses and factories. However, existing MAPD methods do not adequately consider deadlines and tardiness. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two algorithms - Deadline-aware Token Passing (D-TP) and D-TP with Task Swaps (D-TPTS) to solve the MAPD-D problem.

D-TP calculates a pickup deadline for each new task based on its delivery deadline. It then assigns tasks to agents by balancing the proximity to pickup deadline and execution cost. This allows incorporating urgency along with path optimality.

D-TPTS further builds on D-TP by allowing task swaps between agents and task switches within an agent. An agent can swap tasks with another agent if it can reach the pickup location faster. It can also abandon its current task to pick up a more urgent new task if feasible. This improves flexibility and efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- Defines a new problem MAPD-D that considers delivery deadlines and online arrival of tasks, advancing MAPD frameworks

- Proposes a novel algorithm D-TP that calculates pickup deadlines and assigns tasks in a deadline-aware manner to reduce tardiness

- Introduces task swapping strategies in D-TPTS to further improve performance by enhancing flexibility

- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches over existing methods through simulations in warehouse environments

The key impact is enabling efficient operations in automated warehouses and factories that have delivery deadlines by significantly reducing task tardiness.
