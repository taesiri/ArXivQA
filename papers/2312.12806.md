# [MedBench: A Large-Scale Chinese Benchmark for Evaluating Medical Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing medical QA benchmarks have limitations in evaluating Chinese medical LLMs. They lack authenticity, comprehensiveness, or practical clinical data. This makes it difficult to fully assess the capabilities of medical LLMs. 

Proposed Solution - MedBench:
- A large-scale Chinese medical benchmark comprising over 40,000 questions from authentic exams (Chinese Medical Licensing Exam, Resident Standardization Training Exam, Doctor Qualification Exam) and expert-annotated real clinical cases.
- Aligns with medical education and practices in China. Covers diverse medical disciplines and question types (single/multi-statement, case analysis). 
- Enables evaluating medical knowledge, reasoning abilities, and utilization in clinical contexts.

Key Findings:  
- Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, showing need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy.
- General LLMs like ChatGPT possess considerable medical knowledge, demonstrating promising potential.
- ChatGPT has strong practical clinical capabilities but still lacks in case analysis requiring reasoning.
- Item Response Theory integrated to enhance benchmark by stratifying question difficulty.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes MedBench - a comprehensive, practical Chinese medical QA benchmark aligned with medical standards in China
- Extensive analysis of diverse LLMs using accuracy metrics and human evaluation 
- Quantitative analysis of reasoning abilities and incorporation of psychometrics to further enhance benchmark
- Findings demonstrate capabilities and limitations of medical LLMs to aid future research
