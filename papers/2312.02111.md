## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TriDeNT Neptune, a novel self-supervised learning method for utilizing privileged data to improve model performance on downstream tasks using only standard input data. Specifically, TriDeNT Neptune employs a three-branch Siamese network architecture, with two branches acting on augmentations of the primary input data (e.g. H&E histology images) and a third branch acting on privileged paired data (e.g. immunohistochemistry images, expert annotations, or spatial transcriptomics data) only available during training. By enforcing consistency between the representations learned across branches, the model distills knowledge from the privileged data not shared with the standard input to learn more informative features. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over baselines on tissue classification, cell detection, gene expression prediction, and other standard computational pathology tasks when evaluated on only primary H&E images. Uniquely, the method learns a superset of features from both the primary and privileged data without compromising on features only present in the primary input, outperforming both privileged and unprivileged Siamese methods. The approach effectively incorporates and transfers signals from additional scarce, expensive, or expert-generated paired data sources to significantly boost performance on widely available standard inputs for deployment.
