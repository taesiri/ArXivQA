# [CSEPrompts: A Benchmark of Introductory Computer Science Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02540)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Recent advances in AI and natural language processing have led to large language models (LLMs) that can generate high-quality text, including code. This raises concerns about potential misuse of such models to automatically generate assignments and essays in academia.  
- There is limited research on evaluating LLMs specifically on introductory computer science (CS) course assignments. Existing benchmarks focus more on general coding rather than education-focused exercises.

Proposed Solution   
- The authors introduce CSEPrompts, a benchmark comprising 219 Python programming prompts and 50 multiple choice questions gathered from coding websites and CS courses on edX and Coursera.
- They evaluate 8 LLMs on their ability to solve these prompts by generating Python code and answering the MCQs. The models tested include general language models like GPT-3.5 and specialized code models like CodeLLaMA.

Key Contributions
- Creation of CSEPrompts - the first benchmark focused specifically on introductory CS education prompts rather than general coding tasks.
- Analysis of 8 SOTA models representing both general LLMs and specialized code models.
- Evaluation along multiple dimensions - coding websites vs academic prompts, code generation vs MCQs, general vs specialized models.
- Insights like academic prompts being more challenging than coding websites, LLMs performing better at answering MCQs than expected, and specialized code models outperforming general models at coding tasks.

In summary, it is a rigorous benchmark and analysis providing insights into LLMs' capabilities specifically in the context of introductory CS education. The benchmark and findings will be useful for future research at the intersection of AI and computer science education.
