# [EM-TTS: Efficiently Trained Low-Resource Mongolian Lightweight   Text-to-Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08164)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training deep learning based text-to-speech (TTS) models is computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for low-resource languages like Mongolian. 
- Existing TTS models rely on RNNs and transformers which have a large number of parameters.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose EM-TTS, an efficient Mongolian TTS model based entirely on CNNs rather than RNNs or transformers.
- It uses a two-stage training strategy:
    1. Text2Spectrum: Encodes phonemes to a coarse mel spectrogram
    2. SSRN: Synthesizes a fine-grained spectrum from the coarse mel spectrogram
- Several data augmentation techniques are used to expand the limited Mongolian training data:
    - Noise suppression 
    - Time warping, frequency masking, time masking (SpecAugment)
    - Spectrogram resize by compressing/stretching mel spectrograms

Main Contributions:
- EM-TTS significantly reduces model size and training time compared to RNN/transformer TTS models
- The two-stage CNN architecture ensures quality while being lightweight
- Data augmentation expands limited training data and improves model robustness
- Subjective and objective evaluations show EM-TTS generates speech with good quality and similarity while requiring far fewer resources to train.

In summary, the paper proposes a fast and lightweight CNN-based TTS model to address resource-intensive training for low-resource Mongolian speech synthesis. Data augmentation and two-stage training strategy improves quality despite the model simplicity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight Mongolian text-to-speech model called EM-TTS that uses a two-stage convolutional neural network architecture and data augmentation techniques to efficiently synthesize speech with reduced training time and parameters while maintaining decent quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors designed a lightweight acoustic model including two stages - Text2Spectrum and SSRN. Text2Spectrum encodes phonemes into a coarse mel spectrogram, and SSRN synthesizes the complete spectrum from the coarse mel spectrogram. This design ensures good synthesis quality while significantly reducing model parameters and training time. 

2. The authors introduced data augmentation techniques such as noise suppression, time warping, frequency masking and time masking to improve model robustness and deal with the low resource Mongolian language data. These augmentations help increase the training samples.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a fast and lightweight TTS model based on CNNs, and using different data augmentation methods to handle the low-resource Mongolian language dataset. The model reduces training time and parameters while maintaining decent speech synthesis quality.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage TTS model consisting of Text2Spectrum and SSRN. What is the motivation behind using a two-stage model instead of a single-stage end-to-end model? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

2. The Text2Spectrum module uses an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model to generate a coarse mel spectrogram. Why was attention mechanism used here? How does the attention map correlate text and audio?

3. The SSRN module uses only 1D CNN layers. Why were RNN/Transformer layers not used? What are the benefits of using CNN over RNN for acoustic modeling in TTS?

4. What types of data augmentation techniques are used in the paper? Explain time warping, frequency masking and time masking used under SpecAugment. How do these techniques help improve model robustness? 

5. The paper mentions using guided attention loss to enforce diagonal attention. Explain what is meant by diagonal attention and how guided attention loss achieves this? Why is this useful?

6. The results show that the model quality is lower than Tacotron2 and FastSpeech2. What could be the reasons for the lower quality? How can the model quality be further improved?

7. The paper uses mel spectrograms as acoustic features. Would using other acoustic representations like MFCCs, FBanks etc. improve performance? Why/why not?

8. The Text2Spectrum and SSRN modules are trained separately. Would end-to-end joint training provide any benefits? What could be the challenges in doing so?

9. The model uses only CNN based architectures. Do you think introducing some RNN layers can help model long term dependencies better in audio? Why/why not?

10. The paper demonstrates the method on a low-resource Mongolian dataset. How challenging is it to develop TTS for such low-resource languages? What other techniques can help build TTS for them?
