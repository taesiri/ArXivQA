# [Rethinking the Bounds of LLM Reasoning: Are Multi-Agent Discussions the   Key?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent works have claimed that multi-agent discussions improve reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). 
- However, the paper re-evaluates this claim through experiments and finds that a single LLM agent with a strong prompt can match multi-agent discussion performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new multi-agent discussion framework called Conquer-and-Merge Discussion (CMD) to enable comprehensive experiments.
- Systematic experiments are conducted on reasoning tasks using various setups: single LLM agents, existing discussion frameworks like Debate and ReConcile, and the proposed CMD framework.

Key Findings:
- A single LLM agent with a robust prompt and demonstrations performs similarly to multi-agent discussions using equally strong prompts.
- Without demonstrations, multi-agent discussions tend to outperform single LLM agents.
- Analysis reveals two common multi-agent discussion errors: judge mistakes and wrong answer propagation.  
- In multi-LLM discussions, agents powered by stronger LLMs can enhance the performance of agents powered by weaker LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of a new multi-agent group discussion framework CMD to fill gaps in existing works.
- New systematic experiments and analysis that re-examines if multi-agent discussion improves LLM reasoning.
- Key findings on when multi-agent discussion works better than single LLM agents for reasoning tasks.
- Identification of two types of errors that can occur in multi-agent LLM discussions.

In summary, the paper provides a nuanced understanding of when and how to effectively apply multi-agent LLM discussions for reasoning tasks. The proposed CMD framework and experiments reveal insights on the capabilities and limitations of multi-agent discussions.
