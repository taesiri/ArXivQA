# [Controllable seismic velocity synthesis using generative diffusion   models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06277)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lack of diverse and large seismic velocity datasets to train machine learning models for velocity estimation. Manually creating such datasets is difficult. 
- Inability to incorporate multi-modal priors (e.g. geological classes, well logs, subsurface structures) into velocity inversion in a flexible manner.

Proposed Solution:
- Use conditional generative diffusion models to synthesize controllable seismic velocities.
- Model allows flexible incorporation of various conditions like class labels, well logs, reflectivity images to control velocity generation.
- Uses classifier-free guidance with cross-attention mechanism for accurate conditional sampling.
- Handles multiple heterogeneous conditions using cross-attention between diffusion model features and input conditions.

Key Contributions:
- Framework for controllable seismic velocity synthesis using diffusion models.
- Demonstrated velocity generation conditioned on class labels, well logs and reflectivity images.
- Showed ability to handle multiple conditions together through integrated velocity generation.
- Method provides tailored priors for velocity inversion and datasets for training machine learning models.
- Handles out-of-distribution conditions reasonably well indicating potential for practical applications.

In summary, the paper proposes using conditional diffusion models for flexible and controllable seismic velocity synthesis. This facilitates incorporation of diverse expert priors into velocity inversion problems. It also enables creation of tailored datasets for training neural network based inversion methods. The flexibility to handle multiple heterogeneous conditions makes the framework useful for practical velocity estimation applications.
