# [Merging by Matching Models in Task Subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04339)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new model merging framework called MaTS (Matching Models in their Task Subspaces) which views prior merging methods as matching models in a "task subspace" that aims to capture the important dimensions for a task. Specifically, the paper shows how methods like simple averaging, Fisher merging, and RegMean can be seen as projecting models into a task subspace, upweighting the model parameters in that subspace, and then combining the upweighted models. To perform this merging, MaTS formulates it as solving a linear system of equations using the conjugate gradient optimization method. This allows supporting objectives without closed-form solutions, like a block-diagonal approximation of Fisher merging inspired by K-FAC. Through experiments on multitask and intermediate task merging of language and vision models, both with full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods like (IA)^3, the paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of MaTS over prior merging approaches. The flexibility of MaTS through conjugate gradient optimization and perspectives relating merging methods via task subspaces are notable contributions discussed in the paper.
