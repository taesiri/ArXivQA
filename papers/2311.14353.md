# [Average Token Delay: A Duration-aware Latency Metric for Simultaneous   Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14353)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new latency metric called Average Token Delay (ATD) for evaluating simultaneous machine translation systems. ATD measures the average time delay between each input token and the end time of its corresponding output token. This accounts for the delay caused by long translation outputs, which is not handled properly by prior metrics like Average Lagging (AL). Through simulations and experiments on English-German and English-Japanese translation tasks, ATD demonstrated better correlation with human translators' Ear-Voice Span than other metrics. Key benefits are that ATD intuitively measures output chunk length effects, works for speech and text modalities, and is far simpler to calculate than human reference metrics. The authors recommend ATD as an effective automatic evaluation metric to assess the real-time latency tradeoffs of simultaneous translation models and systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new latency metric called Average Token Delay (ATD) for simultaneous machine translation that considers the delay caused by long partial translation outputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new latency metric for simultaneous machine translation called Average Token Delay (ATD). Specifically:

- ATD measures the average delay between the end time of each output token and the end time of its corresponding input token. This allows it to account for the delay caused by long translation outputs, which other metrics like Average Lagging (AL) do not properly measure. 

- Through simulations and experiments on actual machine translation outputs, the paper shows that ATD has a higher correlation with Ear-Voice Span (EVS), which measures latency from human simultaneous interpretation, compared to other metrics like AL. This suggests ATD better captures the latency experience of users.

- ATD is also much simpler to calculate than EVS, not needing things like speech transcription, word alignments, etc. So it can be easily used to evaluate latency of text or speech simultaneous translation systems.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Average Token Delay as an intuitive and effective metric to measure the latency of simultaneous machine translation while properly accounting for the effect of output length on delay.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Simultaneous machine translation (SimulMT) - The task of translating speech or text before the entire input segment is received, starting the translation incrementally.

- Quality-latency tradeoff - The balance between translation quality and latency/delay in simultaneous translation. Lower latency tends to decrease quality.

- Ear-voice span (EVS) - A latency metric used in human simultaneous interpretation that measures the time delay between a word in the source speech and the translation of that word.  

- Average lagging (AL) - A commonly used latency metric that measures how many source words are available when translation begins. Has issues properly evaluating long output chunks.

- Average token delay (ATD) - The proposed novel latency metric that considers the duration of partial translation outputs, penalizing long outputs that delay comprehension and subsequent translation.

- Correlation with EVS - Experiments showing ATD has higher correlation with EVS than other text-based latency metrics, despite being simpler to calculate than EVS.

Does this summarize some of the key terms and concepts discussed in the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new latency metric called Average Token Delay (ATD). How is ATD formulated and what are the key components it considers in its calculation? Explain in detail.

2. The paper argues that existing latency metrics like Average Lagging (AL) have issues when dealing with long chunk outputs in simultaneous translation. Elaborate on these issues and explain why ATD can address them more effectively. 

3. What is the key intuition behind ATD's formulation? How does it aim to model the delay caused by long outputs better than metrics like AL and Differential Average Lagging (DAL)?

4. The paper conducts several simulations to analyze the behavior of ATD. Summarize one of those simulations and discuss the key insights and differences between ATD and other metrics it highlights.  

5. What is Ear-Voice Span (EVS) and how is it used as a reference to evaluate the efficacy of ATD in the experiments? Explain the process of calculating mean EVS.

6. The paper experiments with both speech-to-speech and text-to-text simultaneous translation settings. Compare and contrast the results between the two. How does ATD correlate with mean EVS in both cases?

7. Discuss the similarities and differences between computation-aware and non-computation-aware formulations of ATD. In which cases is one preferred over the other and why?

8. The paper also studies a character-level output setting for Japanese text. How does this impact the correlation between latency metrics like ATD and mean EVS? Explain why.

9. Beyond correlation with mean EVS, discuss other criteria and experiments that can be used to further validate the efficacy of ATD as a latency metric.

10. The paper focuses only on English-German and English-Japanese language pairs. How can the analysis be extended to other languages? What challenges might arise? Discuss.
