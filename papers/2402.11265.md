# [Beyond Literal Descriptions: Understanding and Locating Open-World   Objects Aligned with Human Intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11265)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Classic visual grounding (VG) relies on literal descriptions to locate objects in images. This limits practical applications where users provide intention-based expressions to convey their desires. Existing VG data is also collected from third-person view and single scenes, whereas real-world agents operate in first-person, multi-scene environments. These gaps motivate research into intention-driven VG with egocentric multi-scene perception.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new intention-driven visual grounding (IVG) task. Given an intention query, multiple scene candidates, and ground truth scene/object, models must:
1) Select the scene that best matches the intention query
2) Localize the target object in that scene

To enable research into this task, the paper introduces:
- IntentionVG Dataset: First large-scale (100K images) grounding dataset with free-form intention expressions instead of literal descriptions. Annotated with scene categories to require multi-scene perception.
- Baseline Models: Integrated and end-to-end models incorporating intention interpreters, multi-scene perceivers, and grounding models to establish performance on the new benchmark.

Main Contributions:
1) A new IVG task to push VG research towards real-world intention understanding and multi-scene perception 
2) The large-scale IntentionVG benchmark with rich intention expressions 
3) Strong baseline models for the proposed IVG task, analyzed extensively.

The new task, dataset, and baselines aim to spur further research into intention-based VG by addressing key limitations of classic VG. There remains substantial room for improvement in comprehending and grounding human intentions.
