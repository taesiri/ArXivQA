# [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Controlled Traversing of the Attractor   Landscape of Boolean Models in the Context of Cellular Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cellular reprogramming can help cure diseases, but discovering effective reprogramming strategies with lab experiments is difficult and costly. 
- Boolean networks (BNs) and probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs) are useful for modeling gene regulatory networks (GRNs), but controlling their dynamics to identify reprogramming strategies is challenging, especially for large networks.
- Existing control methods don't scale well and are limited to small/mid-size networks or require decomposing the networks.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate a control problem for BNs/PBNs under asynchronous update for identifying reprogramming strategies to guide cells from a source attractor (cell state) to a target attractor.
- Introduce "pseudo-attractors" - subset of an attractor's frequently revisited states - to allow attractor identification during training.
- Propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework called pbn-STAC to solve the control problem by learning to intervene only in pseudo-attractor states.

Key Contributions:
- Control problem formulation for BNs/PBNs for cellular reprogramming context. Allows more flexible interventions than prior works.
- Notion of pseudo-attractor and method to identify them, enabling application to large networks without full prior attractor info.  
- DRL framework pbn-STAC to solve formulated control problem. Uses branching architecture to scale and intervene only in pseudo-attractor states.
- Evaluation on BN/PBN models of varying sizes for melanoma + biological case study model. Compares to optimal strategies.

The framework shows potential for identifying effective reprogramming strategies on large GRN models where other methods fail. Long control sequence lengths for some cases are a bottleneck needing improvement. Overall, it is a relevant step towards scalable BN/PBN control methods for cellular reprogramming.
