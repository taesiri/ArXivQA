# [Towards leveraging LLMs for Conditional QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01143)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conditional question answering (CQA) is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to issues with memory bias, adherence to input context, and handling diverse question types.
- Key problems include understanding complex questions, mitigating false information risk, and dealing with incomplete information. 

Proposed Solution: 
- Use the Conditional QA (CQA) dataset to evaluate performance of generative LLMs like T5 and UL2 on different question types.
- Explore context retrieval methods and fine-tuning strategies focused on evidence-based answer generation.
- Hypothesis is that properly fine-tuned LLMs can match or exceed state-of-the-art for CQA without architectural changes.

Experiments:
- Trained and evaluated variants of T5 and UL2 on the CQA dataset with increasing complexity. 
- Tested on extractive, generative, unanswerable, multi-hop and incomplete questions.
- Compared to Fusion-in-Decoder model as baseline.
- Evaluated using Exact Match, F1, and embedding similarity metrics.

Key Findings:
- Fine-tuned models can beat SOTA on yes/no questions but struggle on extractive questions.
- Evidence retrieval is a major bottleneck limiting performance.
- Evaluation metric impacts perspective on best model.
- Performance gaps show ongoing challenges in CQA.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive evaluation of generative LLMs on the CQA dataset.
- Analysis of performance on diverse question types. 
- Showing potential to exceed SOTA on yes/no questions with fine-tuning.
- Underscoring critical role and challenges of evidence retrieval.
- Advocating for more holistic evaluation approaches.

Future Work: 
- Refine training tasks and prompts to enhance LLM abilities.
- Explore extract-then-generate approaches.
- Develop better evidence retrieval techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores the capabilities and limitations of large language models on conditional question answering, finding they can surpass state-of-the-art performance on some question types but still face challenges with extractive answers and effectively retrieving evidence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) An extensive exploration of the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) like T5 and UL2 for conditional question answering, using the challenging CQA dataset. 

2) A finding that fine-tuned LLMs can surpass state-of-the-art performance on yes/no questions, with an increase of 7-8 points in Exact Match and F1 scores, but they still lag behind on extractive question answering by over 10 points.

3) An analysis showing the critical role of effective evidence retrieval, indicating the need for more advanced solutions in this area. Performance improves substantially with an oracle retriever providing gold evidence.

4) An argument for the need for a more comprehensive evaluation framework using both token-matching and semantic similarity metrics, rather than relying on any one metric alone.

5) Highlighting the complexity of conditional question answering and the need for future work on refining training tasks, exploring prompt-based techniques, and enhancing evidence retrieval to improve LLM performance.

In summary, the main contribution is a thorough investigation of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for the challenging task of conditional question answering, providing analysis and insights to guide future work.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a search-based context retrieval system to select the most relevant evidence from long documents to provide as input to the QA model. What are some potential drawbacks of using a simple cosine similarity search compared to more sophisticated semantic search methods? How could the search be improved?

2. The paper experiments with both an "oracle" gold evidence retriever and a search-based retriever. What specifically does the performance gap between these two methods tell us about the limitations of the QA pipeline? What are some ways this gap could be reduced?

3. The paper finds that providing too much noisy evidence from the search retrieval seems to actually hurt performance compared to just using the question and scenario text. Why might this occur and how could the evidence selection be improved to mitigate this? 

4. The target formatting for fine-tuning includes generating multiple answers when ambiguous cases are present. However, the single-answer T5 model performs best on some metrics. What might explain this unexpectedly good performance and why might generating multiple answers hurt more than help?

5. The extractive performance substantially lags the state-of-the-art while certain types of generative responses approach or exceed the baseline. Why might extractive performance be so much poorer and what architectural or methodological changes could help boost performance?

6. The paper uses both token-matching and embedding-based evaluation methods. What are some pros and cons of each method and what might a more comprehensive evaluation approach look like?

7. Yes/No performance exceeds the state-of-the-art while remaining question types still underperform. What unique aspects of Yes/No questions might explain this performance disparity and how can performance on other types be boosted?  

8. The performance gaps persist even with gold evidence, indicating room for improvement in reasoning and answering. What are some hypotheses for what is lacking in the reasoning capability and how might the model logic be strengthened?

9. The complexity of even the gold-evidence model performance indicates the overall task remains challenging. What specifically makes this conditional QA task difficult for current methods and how might future work better approach these challenges?

10. The paper proposes manipulating the training procedure, such as focusing first on evidence extraction before answer generation. How could a multi-step training process better force the integration of retrieved evidence into generated responses?
