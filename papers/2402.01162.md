# [2AFC Prompting of Large Multimodal Models for Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01162)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on evaluating the visual quality assessment (IQA) capability of large multimodal models (LMMs). While LMMs have shown impressive performance on high-level vision tasks, their IQA ability has been relatively under-explored. Assessing visual quality is important for numerous applications, so understanding whether LMMs can perform this low-level visual task is valuable.  

Approach:
The paper proposes evaluating LMMs' IQA ability using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC). This involves showing the model two images and asking which has better quality, mimicking how humans assess quality. Different pairing rules from coarse-grained to fine-grained comparisons are introduced. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method aggregates pairwise quality preferences to global quality scores. Three metrics - consistency, accuracy, and correlation - are used to benchmark models.

Experiments: 
Five LMMs (4 open-source, 1 proprietary) are tested on subsets of images from 8 quality datasets. Both synthetically and realistically distorted images are included. Most models demonstrate poor consistency, indicating biased responses. The proprietary model GPT-4V outperforms others significantly. Testing on fine-grained pairs reveals difficulty in close quality discriminations. GPT-4V again exhibits the most promising IQA capability.

Contributions:
1) Comprehensive probing of LMMs' underexplored IQA ability using well-established 2AFC methodology and pairing rules 

2) Rigorous evaluation protocol with both coarse and fine comparisons using multiple quality datasets  

3) Revealing that most existing LMMs lack IQA capabilities, with GPT-4V showing state-of-the-art yet still limited performance

4) Analysis offering insights into limitations of LMMs for IQA, motivating future development of LMMsâ€™ perceptual quality understanding

The work sheds light on incorporating IQA abilities in LMMs to better align with human quality perception. The dataset and benchmark provide a means to track progress in this direction.
