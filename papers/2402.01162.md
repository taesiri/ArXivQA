# [2AFC Prompting of Large Multimodal Models for Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01162)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on evaluating the visual quality assessment (IQA) capability of large multimodal models (LMMs). While LMMs have shown impressive performance on high-level vision tasks, their IQA ability has been relatively under-explored. Assessing visual quality is important for numerous applications, so understanding whether LMMs can perform this low-level visual task is valuable.  

Approach:
The paper proposes evaluating LMMs' IQA ability using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC). This involves showing the model two images and asking which has better quality, mimicking how humans assess quality. Different pairing rules from coarse-grained to fine-grained comparisons are introduced. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method aggregates pairwise quality preferences to global quality scores. Three metrics - consistency, accuracy, and correlation - are used to benchmark models.

Experiments: 
Five LMMs (4 open-source, 1 proprietary) are tested on subsets of images from 8 quality datasets. Both synthetically and realistically distorted images are included. Most models demonstrate poor consistency, indicating biased responses. The proprietary model GPT-4V outperforms others significantly. Testing on fine-grained pairs reveals difficulty in close quality discriminations. GPT-4V again exhibits the most promising IQA capability.

Contributions:
1) Comprehensive probing of LMMs' underexplored IQA ability using well-established 2AFC methodology and pairing rules 

2) Rigorous evaluation protocol with both coarse and fine comparisons using multiple quality datasets  

3) Revealing that most existing LMMs lack IQA capabilities, with GPT-4V showing state-of-the-art yet still limited performance

4) Analysis offering insights into limitations of LMMs for IQA, motivating future development of LMMsâ€™ perceptual quality understanding

The work sheds light on incorporating IQA abilities in LMMs to better align with human quality perception. The dataset and benchmark provide a means to track progress in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using two-alternative forced choice prompting and maximum a posterior estimation to evaluate the image quality assessment capability of large multimodal models, finding that while proprietary models like GPT-4V show promise, open-source models still struggle with fine-grained quality discrimination.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a comprehensive framework to probe the image quality assessment (IQA) capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) using two-alternative forced choice experiments. Specifically:

1) The authors devise coarse-grained and fine-grained pairing rules to create IQA datasets to evaluate LMMs. 

2) They utilize maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to efficiently aggregate the pairwise quality preferences predicted by LMMs into global quality scores. 

3) Three evaluation criteria - consistency, accuracy, and correlation - are introduced to quantify different aspects of the IQA capabilities of LMMs.

4) Experiments on subsets of eight IQA datasets reveal strengths and weaknesses of several state-of-the-art LMMs in perceptual image quality assessment. The proprietary LMM GPT-4V demonstrates promising capability, but there remains room for improvement.

5) The proposed framework sheds light on developing more advanced LMMs with improved visual quality understanding in the future.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large multimodal models (LMMs)
- Image quality assessment (IQA) 
- Two-alternative forced choice (2AFC)
- Maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation
- Consistency, accuracy, correlation (evaluation criteria)
- Coarse-grained quality comparison
- Fine-grained quality comparison
- Synthetic distortions
- Realistic distortions  

The paper proposes using 2AFC prompting and MAP estimation to evaluate the IQA capabilities of several LMMs on both coarse-grained and fine-grained quality comparisons. It introduces consistency, accuracy, and correlation as evaluation criteria, and tests the models on subsets of images with synthetic and realistic distortions. The key terms reflect this focus on benchmarking IQA abilities of LMMs through 2AFC comparisons and quantitative analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) prompting to evaluate the image quality assessment (IQA) capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Why is 2AFC considered the most reliable way of collecting human opinions on visual quality? What are the advantages of using 2AFC over other approaches?

2. The paper mentions coarse-grained and fine-grained pairing rules for IQA evaluation. Can you explain the key differences between coarse-grained and fine-grained pairing? What types of image pairs would you use for each? 

3. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is used to aggregate the pairwise quality rankings into global scores. What is the intuition behind the MAP formulation used in Eq. 1? How does it convert the pairwise comparisons into global scores?

4. Three evaluation criteria are proposed - consistency, accuracy and correlation. What does each criterion capture about the IQA capabilities of the LLM? Why is it important to have all three rather than just one?

5. What differences did you notice in the IQA performance of the LLMs on synthetic vs real distortion datasets? What could be the reasons behind these differences?

6. The results show the proprietary LLM GPT-4V performs much better than other models. What factors may contribute to the superior performance of GPT-4V? How can we improve other LLMs to match its capability?

7. The fine-grained experiments reveal that existing LLMs struggle with some types of distortions like AWGN. Why do you think this is the case? How can the models' robustness be improved?

8. Do you think the 2AFC prompting methodology can be extended to other perceptual tasks beyond IQA? What other tasks could benefit from such an approach?

9. The paper analyzes five representative LLMs for IQA. How would the results potentially differ if more recent models were tested? What abilities of newer LLMs could positively impact IQA?

10. The benchmark shows much room for improving LLMs' fine-grained IQA capabilities. What are some promising future directions that can help close this gap? What methodology changes or model architectures could help?
