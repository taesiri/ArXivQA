# [Scheduling for On-Board Federated Learning with Satellite Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the challenge of implementing federated learning (FL) in mega-constellations of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites connected with intra-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). In canonical FL, multiple rounds of communication between clients and parameter server are required. However, for satellite constellations, these rounds take very long time due to intermittent connectivity caused by satellites' predictable non-visibility periods to ground stations. Prior works using intra-orbit ISLs reduce delay by allowing one visible satellite in each orbit to access information from other satellites. But for some constellations, prolonged non-visibility of all satellites still causes issues.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a scheduling scheme comprising two schedulers to address the intermittent connectivity challenge:

1) Global Update (GU) Scheduler: Executed at ground station. Determines appropriate time instants for performing global updates using satellites' predictable cumulative visibility pattern. Notifies satellites.

2) Cluster Update (CU) Scheduler: In each orbit, schedules FL procedures based on global update times from GU scheduler. Dynamically allocates suitable local training duration to satellites proportional to usable time until next global update.

Main Contributions:
- Concept of predictable cumulative visibility pattern of all satellites within each orbit
- GU scheduler that controls global update timing across orbits 
- CU scheduler that allocates local training duration to satellites within each orbit
- Schedulers coordinate to determine global update times and allocate proportional local training duration to satellites
- Improved test accuracy within shorter time compared to no scheduling

In summary, the paper proposes a scheduling scheme for on-board FL in LEO satellite constellations, leveraging predictable visibility patterns. The scheme uses two collaborative schedulers to determine appropriate global update times and allocate proportional local training duration to satellites. This leads to improved learning efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a scheduling scheme with two coordinating schedulers to efficiently perform federated learning in a satellite constellation connected with intra-orbit inter-satellite links by leveraging the predictable visibility patterns to determine appropriate global update times and dynamically adjust the number of local training epochs within each orbit.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a scheduling scheme for on-board federated learning in satellite constellations connected with intra-orbit inter-satellite links. The key points are:

- The scheme leverages the predictability of the visibility pattern of each satellite as well as the cumulative visibility pattern of all satellites within each orbit to address the intermittent connectivity issue. 

- It comprises two schedulers: 1) a global update (GU) scheduler that determines appropriate time instants for performing global updates at the ground station, and 2) a cluster update (CU) scheduler that controls the federated learning procedures within each orbit/cluster based on the timing information from the GU scheduler.

- The CU scheduler dynamically adjusts the number of local epochs performed by the satellites in each iteration based on the available time before the next global update. This leads to improved test accuracy compared to schemes with a fixed number of epochs.

- Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheduling scheme enhances test accuracy within a shorter time by coordinating global update times and allocating suitable local training duration to satellites.

In summary, the key contribution is an efficient scheduling scheme for on-board federated learning in satellite constellations by exploiting the predictable visibility patterns.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper introduces the concept of "cumulative visibility pattern" for a cluster of satellites. How is this concept defined and why is it important for scheduling federated learning procedures in satellite clusters?

2) The proposed scheduling scheme has two main components: The global update (GU) scheduler and the cluster update (CU) scheduler. Explain the key responsibilities of each scheduler and how they coordinate the scheduling decisions. 

3) The GU scheduler determines the time instants for performing global updates, denoted by $t_n$. Explain how $t_n$ is calculated by considering the visibility patterns and required communication/computing durations.

4) The paper defines the concept of "demand time" $t_{n,p}^{D}$ for each cluster $p$. What does this represent and how is it used to determine the earliest feasible time $t_{n,p}^{F}$ for receiving aggregated parameters from cluster $p$?

5) When the CU scheduler receives the next global update time $t_n$, how does it calculate the available time $T_{n,p}^{A}$ that can be allocated to cluster $p$ for local training and communication procedures?

6) Based on the available time $T_{n,p}^{A}$, the CU scheduler determines the number of local epochs $I_{n,p}$ for cluster $p$. Explain how $I_{n,p}$ is calculated and why dynamically adjusting it is useful.

7) How does the predictability of satellite visibility patterns help in determining the sink satellite for transmitting aggregated parameters back to the ground station?

8) How does the proposed scheduling scheme help improve accuracy compared to an approach without scheduling? Explain both in terms of lower and higher number of local epochs.

9) The scheduling scheme assumes predictable visibility patterns. How can uncertainties in visibility be handled? Would the scheme still be effective if patterns change dynamically?

10) The paper considers a simple ring topology for satellites in each orbit using inter-satellite links. Could the scheduling approach be extended for more complex topologies among satellites across orbits?
