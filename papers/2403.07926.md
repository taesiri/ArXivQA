# [Value Prediction for Spatiotemporal Gait Data Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07926)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Human gait analysis has applications in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, rehabilitation, and prediction of health conditions. Traditional gait analysis relies on expert observation or expensive motion capture systems limited to clinical settings. Recent advances allow quantitative gait data acquisition using inexpensive, wearable sensors, however analysis still requires expert knowledge. There remains a gap in customized, accurate, real-time gait modeling and analysis methods tuned to the individual that can be used beyond clinical settings.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a technique to generate accurate, customized deep learning models to predict time-series spatiotemporal gait data for each individual using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and RNN combined with convolutional neural networks (CNN). They introduce two experimental setups: (1) 'by trial' uses a single trial for short-term prediction, (2) 'by participant' uses multiple trials for long-term prediction of entire trials. Models are trained on gait cycles from healthy participants using sensor data.

Main Contributions:

C1. Propose deep learning method for value prediction of gait data suitable for applications in patient monitoring, rehabilitation, fall prediction, exoskeleton assistance rather than just classification.

C2. Generate customized models for each participant that achieve high accuracy despite using less training data, train faster, and can predict in real-time.

C3. Expand application of ensemble CNN+RNN models to time-series gait data value prediction.

Results show short-term models achieve RMSE as low as 0.060675, while long-term models predict entire trials accurately (RMSE=0.106365). The customized models can predict in a fraction of time needed to acquire new data from participant. This enables real-time applications.
