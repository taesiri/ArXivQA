# [Skeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15337)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper seems to be that large language models (LLMs) can generate high-quality answers more efficiently by first producing a skeleton outline of the answer in parallel, rather than decoding the full answer sequentially token-by-token. 

Specifically, the authors propose a method called "Skeleton-of-Thought" (SoT) which prompts the LLM to first generate a concise skeleton with the main points of the answer. Then, the details of each point are generated independently and in parallel, either via parallel API calls or batched decoding. 

The central research questions seem to be:

- Can guiding the LLM to produce a skeleton outline first enable parallel generation of the answer details, thereby accelerating the decoding process?

- Does generating the answer in this less sequential, more structured way impact the quality of the final answer compared to standard autoregressive decoding?

To test these hypotheses, the authors evaluate SoT on a variety of recent LLMs and find that it can provide significant speedups (up to 2.4x) while maintaining or even improving answer quality in many cases. They also analyze the speedups and answer quality across different models, question types, and metrics.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that parallel decoding guided by a skeleton outline can make LLMs more efficient at generating high-quality answers. The authors design and evaluate the SoT method to test this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a method called "Skeleton-of-Thought" (SoT) to reduce the inference latency of large language models (LLMs) by guiding the model to first generate a concise outline (skeleton) of the answer, then expand on each point in the skeleton in parallel. 

2. Demonstrating that SoT can provide significant speedups (up to 2.39x) on the inference latency of various LLMs without any model or hardware changes, just through prompt engineering.

3. Showing that in addition to improving efficiency, SoT can also enhance the quality of LLM generations in terms of diversity and relevance for certain types of questions that have clear answer structures.

4. Providing insights on how SoT is related to and different from prior work on efficient LLMs, prompting methods, and human writing/thinking processes.

5. Discussing limitations of current SoT methods and open questions for future work, such as adapting SoT across more question types, integrating SoT with existing throughput-optimization techniques, and exploring the possibilities of guiding LLMs to generate dynamic "Graphs-of-Thought."

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating SoT as a way to improve LLM efficiency and potentially quality solely through prompt engineering, demonstrating the promise of "data-centric" optimizations for LLMs. The paper also provides good context on connections to related work and future directions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a high-level analysis of how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper proposes a new method called Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) to accelerate the decoding process of large language models (LLMs) by generating different parts of the answer in parallel rather than sequentially. Most prior work on accelerating LLM inference focuses on model compression, system optimization, and speculative decoding. SoT provides a novel perspective of using prompt engineering to reorganize the decoding content for higher parallelism.

- Compared to model compression techniques like pruning and quantization, SoT does not change the model architecture or weights. It is orthogonal and complementary to these techniques.

- Compared to system optimization methods like pipeline parallelism, SoT reorganizes the model workload itself rather than only optimizing the workload scheduling. SoT can also harness these system techniques to further accelerate its batched decoding. 

- Compared to speculative decoding methods which generate candidate tokens in parallel, SoT generates different parts of the content in parallel as specified by the skeleton. It does not rely on an auxiliary model and verification.

- While most prompt engineering work aims at improving model quality, SoT novelly utilizes prompting to improve efficiency. The idea of guiding the model to decompose its thoughts aligns with how humans strategically structure thoughts and writing.

- SoT accelerates decoding for general open-domain conversational scenarios. Its effectiveness on more complex logical reasoning tasks remains to be explored. Methods like Chain-of-Thought have shown strong reasoning ability by promoting step-by-step thinking.

In summary, SoT provides a new angle of utilizing prompt engineering for efficiency rather than just quality. It accelerates decoding in an end-to-end, model-agnostic manner without architectural changes. SoT opens up the idea of "content co-organization" for efficiency, complementing existing techniques. More work is needed to expand SoT's applicability and combine its benefits with other methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

1. Improving the Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) method to handle broader types of questions, such as math problems that require step-by-step reasoning. The authors suggest enabling SoT to adaptively fall back to single-stage sequential decoding for certain types of questions not suitable for parallel decoding.

2. Fine-tuning models to better understand the skeleton and point-expanding prompts in SoT, and produce more fluent and coherent final answers for a wider range of question categories.

3. Integrating SoT with existing throughput-oriented techniques and inference engines to reveal the full potential of SoT in improving both latency and throughput. 

4. Generalizing SoT to a "Graph-of-Thoughts" approach where the points have dependencies represented as a graph, allowing more complex reasoning while retaining some parallel decoding.

5. Exploring data-centric techniques like SoT more thoroughly for improving efficiency, in addition to existing model-centric techniques like compression and system-centric techniques like parallelism.

6. Developing techniques to automatically trigger either SoT or standard decoding depending on user instructions and question type.

7. Evaluating SoT more rigorously over a larger prompt set and with human evaluation.

In summary, the authors lay out research directions to improve SoT itself, integrate it with other systems, and explore the broader potential of using data organization techniques like SoT for improving efficiency. They also suggest ways to make SoT more adaptive and to evaluate it more thoroughly.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called "Skeleton-of-Thought" (SoT) to accelerate the inference latency of large language models (LLMs) without changing the model, system, or hardware. Instead of doing fully sequential decoding, SoT guides the LLM to first generate a skeleton outline for the answer, then complete the details of each point in the skeleton in parallel via batched decoding or parallel API calls. Experiments on 11 recent LLMs show SoT provides 1.3x-2.4x speedup. Beyond efficiency, SoT also improves diversity and relevance for some question types, owing to the structured thinking process it imposes on LLMs. The paper positions SoT as an initial attempt at "data-centric optimization for efficiency" to complement model/system/hardware co-design, and discusses limitations and future directions like dynamic graph-of-thought.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called "Skeleton-of-Thought" (SoT) to accelerate the decoding process of large language models (LLMs). Rather than generating text sequentially token-by-token, the SoT method first prompts the LLM to generate a skeleton outline for the answer. Then it expands on each point of the skeleton in parallel, either by making parallel API calls or batched decoding. By generating different parts of the answer in parallel, the method can provide significant speedups in end-to-end inference time compared to standard sequential decoding. 

The authors test SoT on 11 recent LLMs and find speedups ranging from 1.3x to 2.4x. In addition to accelerating inference, SoT can also improve answer quality and diversity for certain question types where a structured outline is beneficial. The paper discusses how SoT is related to other LLM optimization methods, and also raises open questions about expanding SoT to a more dynamic "Graph-of-Thought" framework. Overall, SoT provides a new data-driven approach to improving LLM efficiency without changing the model architecture or hardware.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes "Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT)" to accelerate the decoding process of large language models without changing the model architecture or system. The key idea is to prompt the language model to first generate a concise outline or "skeleton" for answering the question. This skeleton is extracted and then used to guide parallel decoding of different parts of the answer. Specifically, the method has two main stages:

1) Skeleton stage: Use a "skeleton prompt template" to get the language model to generate a list of concise skeleton points for the answer. Extract the point indexes and skeletons using regular expressions. 

2) Point-expanding stage: Use each skeleton point to construct "point-expanding prompts" that guide the language model to expand on that specific point. Send these prompts in parallel via API calls or batched inference to decode different parts of the answer simultaneously. Finally, aggregate the expanded points into the complete answer.

By reorganizing the content generation into parallelizable chunks, SoT is able to accelerate the decoding process without changing the model itself. Experiments show speedups of 1.3-2.4x across several large language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and questions addressed in this paper are:

- The paper aims to improve the inference speed and reduce the latency of large language models (LLMs) for conversational AI systems. Slow inference speed is a major bottleneck limiting the interactive use of LLMs. 

- It identifies three main causes of the slow inference speed: large model size, quadratic complexity of attention, and sequential autoregressive decoding.

- The paper specifically focuses on tackling the sequential decoding limitation. It questions whether LLMs necessarily have to generate text in a purely sequential token-by-token manner during inference.

- It draws inspiration from how humans plan and organize thoughts - we often think of an outline or main points first before filling in details. The paper explores whether LLMs can also do "parallel decoding" by generating key points in parallel rather than strictly sequentially.

- The main research questions are: Can prompting techniques guide LLMs to produce a high-level skeleton first? Can the details of different points then be generated independently in parallel? And can this improve inference speed without sacrificing output quality?

In summary, the paper addresses the problem of slow inference in conversational LLMs, specifically targeting the sequential decoding limitation, and explores parallel decoding guided by prompts as a potential solution. The key questions surround the feasibility and efficacy of this approach.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), a method that reduces the latency of large language model (LLM) inference by having the LLM first generate a concise skeleton answer before expanding on the skeleton points in parallel. Motivated by human thought processes, SoT prompts the LLM to provide 3-10 brief skeleton points that cover different perspectives on the question. Then, the skeleton points are expanded either via batched local decoding or parallel API calls. Experiments on 12 recent LLM architectures show SoT provides up to 2.39x speedups on suitable questions while maintaining or even improving answer quality. An extension using a classifier to route questions achieves more robust performance. As an initial attempt at data-centric efficiency optimization by structuring LLM outputs, SoT opens up new possibilities for trading off quality, efficiency, and flexibility in future LM systems.
