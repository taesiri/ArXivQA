# [Underwater Robot Pose Estimation Using Acoustic Methods and Intermittent   Position Measurements at the Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately estimating the position and orientation (pose) of underwater robots is challenging due to inability to use GPS and limitations of acoustic and inertial sensors. 
- Existing methods using vision, acoustics or inertial sensors have limitations in visibility, sensor precision and drift over time.
- The paper investigates optimal sensor configurations and pose estimation approaches for an underwater robot performing litter search and collection.

Methods:
- Simulations performed in Gazebo and ROS using a model of the SubseaTech Tortuga underwater vehicle.
- Sensors simulated: IMU, Doppler Velocity Log, Ultra-Short Baseline acoustic system, depth sensor. 
- Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implemented for sensor fusion and pose estimation.
- Different combinations of sensor configurations evaluated: IMU-only, IMU+USBL, IMU+DVL, IMU+DVL+USBL.
- For drift mitigation, intermittent precise position measurements from surface evaluated, simulating GPS or aerial imaging.

Results:
- IMU-only configuration drifts quickly. IMU+DVL improves accuracy but still drifts over time.  
- IMU+USBL provides reasonable position estimate without drift but noisy. 
- IMU+DVL+USBL gives best underwater-only accuracy.
- Intermittent surface measurements (1 sec) with IMU+USBL significantly reduces drift. 
- Surface measurements (30 sec) with IMU-only also works reasonably well.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis and comparison of pose estimation performance with different minimal sensor configurations for underwater robots
- Demonstration that an intermittent precise surface position measurement can mitigate underwater drift at low update rates
- Provides guidance on choosing optimal sensor configurations for underwater localization

The paper provides useful insight on the tradeoffs between different sensor configurations and fusion algorithms for underwater robot pose estimation. A key highlight is using intermittent surface measurements to limit drift for lowercase cost sensing suites.
