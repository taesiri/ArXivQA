# MISF: Multi-level Interactive Siamese Filtering for High-Fidelity Image   Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is how to develop an effective image inpainting method that can generate natural and high-fidelity results. Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges in image inpainting:1. Producing high-fidelity results that are identical to the ground truth image, not just realistic. 2. Generalizing well across different scenes and missing area shapes/sizes.To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a novel filtering-based method called Multi-level Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF). The key ideas are:- Conduct filtering not just at the image level but also at the semantic feature level to fill in missing information.- Use a predictive network to dynamically estimate filtering kernels based on the input image and multi-level features. This allows adapting the kernels to each input.- Perform multi-level filtering interactively, with information flowing between the kernel prediction branch and the filtering branch.  The central hypothesis is that this multi-level interactive filtering approach will better reproduce fidelity and semantic information compared to existing encoder-decoder networks, leading to state-of-the-art performance in image inpainting across different datasets and mask conditions. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the paper focuses on improving fidelity and generalization in image inpainting via a new filtering-based method that operates interactively across image and feature levels.
