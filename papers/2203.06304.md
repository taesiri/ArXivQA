# MISF: Multi-level Interactive Siamese Filtering for High-Fidelity Image   Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is how to develop an effective image inpainting method that can generate natural and high-fidelity results. Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges in image inpainting:1. Producing high-fidelity results that are identical to the ground truth image, not just realistic. 2. Generalizing well across different scenes and missing area shapes/sizes.To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a novel filtering-based method called Multi-level Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF). The key ideas are:- Conduct filtering not just at the image level but also at the semantic feature level to fill in missing information.- Use a predictive network to dynamically estimate filtering kernels based on the input image and multi-level features. This allows adapting the kernels to each input.- Perform multi-level filtering interactively, with information flowing between the kernel prediction branch and the filtering branch.  The central hypothesis is that this multi-level interactive filtering approach will better reproduce fidelity and semantic information compared to existing encoder-decoder networks, leading to state-of-the-art performance in image inpainting across different datasets and mask conditions. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the paper focuses on improving fidelity and generalization in image inpainting via a new filtering-based method that operates interactively across image and feature levels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel image inpainting method called Multi-level Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF). Here are the key points:- The paper studies the advantages and limitations of using predictive filtering for image inpainting. It finds that image-level filtering can restore local structures but fails to fill large missing areas. - To address this issue, the paper proposes semantic filtering, which conducts filtering on deep feature levels. This allows filling missing semantic information but loses image details.- To combine the benefits of image-level and semantic filtering, the paper proposes MISF. It contains two interactively linked branches: kernel prediction branch (KPB) and semantic & image filtering branch (SIFB). - KPB takes the raw image and SIFB features as input to predict kernels for SIFB. SIFB conducts filtering on both image and feature levels using the predicted kernels.- As a result, MISF leverages multi-level filtering to complete both semantic information and image details, achieving high-fidelity inpainting.- Experiments show MISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods on image quality metrics. Ablations validate the effectiveness of different components.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the interactive multi-level filtering framework MISF to achieve high-fidelity image inpainting by leveraging both semantic and image-level information. The experiments demonstrate its effectiveness over existing methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a new method called Multi-level Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF) for high-fidelity image inpainting, which employs predictive filtering jointly at the image level and deep feature level in a unified framework to effectively complete both semantic information and detailed structures for generating natural and realistic inpainted results.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:- The paper focuses on using predictive filtering techniques for image inpainting, which is a relatively new approach compared to generative adversarial networks (GANs) that dominate much of recent inpainting research. The predictive filtering aims to complete missing image regions by predicting suitable kernels and performing pixel-wise filtering.- Most prior inpainting works treat it as a generation task and use encoder-decoder architectures with GANs. This paper argues that a key limitation is neglecting explicit pixel-level priors like smoothness that predictive filtering leverages.- The proposed multi-level interactive siamese filtering (MISF) combines both image-level and semantic/feature-level predictive filtering in a novel framework. This allows exploiting advantages of each - image filtering preserves details while semantic filtering fills missing semantics.- The paper demonstrates MISF outperforms recent leading approaches like partial convolutions and recurrent feature reasoning, especially for larger missing regions. Both quantitative metrics and visual results support the advantages.- The technique is evaluated on common benchmarks like Places2 and CelebA as well as a real-world dataset, showing its generalization capability. The framework and concepts seem applicable to other restoration tasks too.- Compared to concurrent works on predictive filtering for inpainting like JPGNet, a key difference of MISF lies in the joint image and semantic filtering at multiple levels. The paper shows the importance of this through ablation studies.- The interactive linking of the kernel prediction and filtering branches is a notable contribution, enabling dynamic filtering conditioned on input image and features.Overall, the paper presents a novel filtering-based perspective to inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art results. The comparisons and analyses provide good insights into the advantages over existing GAN and encoder-decoder-based techniques. The dynamic multi-level filtering approach appears promising for further exploration.
