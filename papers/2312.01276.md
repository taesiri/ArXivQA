# [Running cognitive evaluations on large language models: The do's and the   don'ts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01276)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper discusses methodological considerations and best practices for evaluating the cognitive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using language-based assessments originally designed for humans. 

It first provides three case studies that highlight common pitfalls and issues that have arisen in prior work attempting to assess LLMs' cognitive skills. These include failing to control for shortcuts the models might use, not considering what the models may have seen during training, lacking proper control experiments, overgeneralizing from a single test, and more.

The paper then provides a list of 10 "dos and don'ts" to help design high-quality evaluations of LLMs' capabilities: Consider shortcuts, design careful controls, check training data, test generalization, avoid minor test changes, use high-quality examples, compare to humans, match evaluation conditions, don't assume same mechanisms, and avoid jumping to conclusions.

It concludes by discussing four open issues around evaluating LLMs: sensitivity to prompt wording, lack of cultural/linguistic diversity in training data, using LLMs to generate test materials or score responses, and differences between testing open versus closed models. 

Overall, the paper aims to contribute to best practices in the growing field of "AI psychology" by distilling lessons learned so far and providing guidance to improve the validity of future work that probes the cognitive capacities of AI systems through language-based assessments. The goal is to advance a careful, robust methodology for making warranted claims about these systems' capabilities.
