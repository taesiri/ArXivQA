# [Running cognitive evaluations on large language models: The do's and the   don'ts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01276)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper discusses methodological considerations and best practices for evaluating the cognitive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using language-based assessments originally designed for humans. 

It first provides three case studies that highlight common pitfalls and issues that have arisen in prior work attempting to assess LLMs' cognitive skills. These include failing to control for shortcuts the models might use, not considering what the models may have seen during training, lacking proper control experiments, overgeneralizing from a single test, and more.

The paper then provides a list of 10 "dos and don'ts" to help design high-quality evaluations of LLMs' capabilities: Consider shortcuts, design careful controls, check training data, test generalization, avoid minor test changes, use high-quality examples, compare to humans, match evaluation conditions, don't assume same mechanisms, and avoid jumping to conclusions.

It concludes by discussing four open issues around evaluating LLMs: sensitivity to prompt wording, lack of cultural/linguistic diversity in training data, using LLMs to generate test materials or score responses, and differences between testing open versus closed models. 

Overall, the paper aims to contribute to best practices in the growing field of "AI psychology" by distilling lessons learned so far and providing guidance to improve the validity of future work that probes the cognitive capacities of AI systems through language-based assessments. The goal is to advance a careful, robust methodology for making warranted claims about these systems' capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper provides methodological guidelines and open questions for evaluating the cognitive capacities of large language models using language-based assessments, drawing on case studies and arguing for careful controls when making inferences about models' abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is to provide methodological guidance and best practices for evaluating the cognitive capacities of large language models (LLMs) using language-based assessments. 

Specifically, the paper:

1) Discusses three case studies that highlight common pitfalls and issues that can arise when testing LLMs, such as not considering shortcuts the models may use, lacking proper control conditions, and contamination of test items in the training data. 

2) Provides a list of 10 "do's and don'ts" for designing high-quality cognitive evaluations of LLMs, covering topics like controlling for shortcuts, comparing model and human performance, evaluating models under human-like conditions, and not overinterpreting isolated successes or failures.

3) Discusses several outstanding issues in the emerging field of AI psychology that lack clear consensus, including prompt engineering, cultural biases in LLMs, using LLMs as research assistants, and testing open vs closed models.

4) Calls for careful, rigorous methodology and transparent reporting when making claims about the capacities of LLMs based on cognitive assessments. Advocates moving the field toward best practices.

In summary, the paper aims to advance the methodology and discussions around understanding the abilities of LLMs through principled behavioral testing.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper discusses the importance of considering potential "shortcuts" that language models may use to solve tasks. What are some examples of shortcuts mentioned in the paper, and what methods does the author recommend for identifying or controlling for shortcuts?

2. The paper advocates for careful control conditions when evaluating language models. Can you describe one of the case studies discussed where lack of controls led to overestimation of model capabilities? What control condition(s) could have been implemented? 

3. Prompt engineering is mentioned as an emerging issue in AI psychology assessments. In what ways could prompt sensitivity complicate interpreting the results of cognitive evaluations of language models? How might researchers address or account for this sensitivity?

4. The paper argues that language model responses likely reflect WEIRD biases. How might researchers examine or control for cultural biases when using language models to simulate human behavior? What are some limitations of attempting to mitigate bias by customizing prompts?

5. What are some risks associated with using language models to automatically generate test items or evaluate responses? How could researchers validate these methods before employing them?

6. The paper suggests evaluating open vs. closed language models for different purposes going forward. What is the key distinction, and what types of studies might be better suited for open or closed models respectively?

7. One case study involved issues with comparing language model and human performance on a task. What principles does the paper recommend when benchmarking language model performance against humans? When might divergence in evaluation approaches be justified?

8. What does the paper mean when it advises not to "jump to conclusions" about language model capabilities? What measured stance does it argue researchers should take instead?

9. The paper states that good performance on one test does not necessarily mean a model has a capability. Why does testing generalization across diverse assessments matter? What other approaches could reveal underlying mechanisms?

10. Which of the methodological issues discussed most stood out to you? Are there any you think require more discussion or exploration moving forward? What open questions remain?
