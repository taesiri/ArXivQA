# [Score Jacobian Chaining: Lifting Pretrained 2D Diffusion Models for 3D   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we take a pretrained 2D diffusion model and lift it to perform 3D generative modeling, without requiring any 3D training data?

The key ideas proposed to address this question are:

- Interpret diffusion models as learning a vector field of gradients (scores). Apply chain rule to propagate these scores through a differentiable renderer to get 3D gradients.

- Use a voxel radiance field as the 3D representation, which is fast to query and differentiable. Render multiview images and backpropagate 2D gradients into 3D. 

- Identify and address the out-of-distribution problem faced when evaluating the denoising diffusion model on rendered images, via a proposed perturbation and ensemble technique.

- Validate the approach by taking various pretrained 2D diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and converting them into 3D generative models, demonstrated via text-to-3D generation.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that by exploiting score functions and differentiable rendering, they can repurpose a 2D generative model for 3D modeling without any 3D training data. The experiments and results validate this hypothesis.
