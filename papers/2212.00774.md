# [Score Jacobian Chaining: Lifting Pretrained 2D Diffusion Models for 3D   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we take a pretrained 2D diffusion model and lift it to perform 3D generative modeling, without requiring any 3D training data?

The key ideas proposed to address this question are:

- Interpret diffusion models as learning a vector field of gradients (scores). Apply chain rule to propagate these scores through a differentiable renderer to get 3D gradients.

- Use a voxel radiance field as the 3D representation, which is fast to query and differentiable. Render multiview images and backpropagate 2D gradients into 3D. 

- Identify and address the out-of-distribution problem faced when evaluating the denoising diffusion model on rendered images, via a proposed perturbation and ensemble technique.

- Validate the approach by taking various pretrained 2D diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and converting them into 3D generative models, demonstrated via text-to-3D generation.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that by exploiting score functions and differentiable rendering, they can repurpose a 2D generative model for 3D modeling without any 3D training data. The experiments and results validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a method (Score Jacobian Chaining) to convert a pretrained 2D diffusion generative model into a 3D generative model of radiance fields, without requiring any 3D training data. 

- Interpreting diffusion models as learned predictors of gradient fields (score functions). The proposed method applies chain rule on the estimated 2D image scores and backpropagates them through the Jacobian of a differentiable volumetric renderer to obtain a 3D score.

- Identifying the out-of-distribution issue when evaluating a denoising diffusion model on non-noisy rendered images from a 3D scene. The paper proposes a perturbation-based method called Perturb-and-Average Scoring to address this issue.

- Conducting experiments first on a 2D image canvas to validate the proposed Perturb-and-Average Scoring method. The results illustrate the challenges of using unconditioned diffusion models and the benefits of strong conditioning texts.

- Demonstrating the application of Score Jacobian Chaining for 3D text-conditioned generation using the pretrained Stable Diffusion model. The results showcase the generation of complex 3D shapes from text prompts.

- Providing analysis to justify the proposed Perturb-and-Average Scoring method and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization techniques.

In summary, the core contribution is a novel method to repurpose a pretrained 2D diffusion model for 3D generation by chaining and propagating the 2D gradients based on the model's score function. The other contributions provide supporting empirical validation, analysis, and evidence for this idea.
