# [Score Jacobian Chaining: Lifting Pretrained 2D Diffusion Models for 3D   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we take a pretrained 2D diffusion model and lift it to perform 3D generative modeling, without requiring any 3D training data?

The key ideas proposed to address this question are:

- Interpret diffusion models as learning a vector field of gradients (scores). Apply chain rule to propagate these scores through a differentiable renderer to get 3D gradients.

- Use a voxel radiance field as the 3D representation, which is fast to query and differentiable. Render multiview images and backpropagate 2D gradients into 3D. 

- Identify and address the out-of-distribution problem faced when evaluating the denoising diffusion model on rendered images, via a proposed perturbation and ensemble technique.

- Validate the approach by taking various pretrained 2D diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and converting them into 3D generative models, demonstrated via text-to-3D generation.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that by exploiting score functions and differentiable rendering, they can repurpose a 2D generative model for 3D modeling without any 3D training data. The experiments and results validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a method (Score Jacobian Chaining) to convert a pretrained 2D diffusion generative model into a 3D generative model of radiance fields, without requiring any 3D training data. 

- Interpreting diffusion models as learned predictors of gradient fields (score functions). The proposed method applies chain rule on the estimated 2D image scores and backpropagates them through the Jacobian of a differentiable volumetric renderer to obtain a 3D score.

- Identifying the out-of-distribution issue when evaluating a denoising diffusion model on non-noisy rendered images from a 3D scene. The paper proposes a perturbation-based method called Perturb-and-Average Scoring to address this issue.

- Conducting experiments first on a 2D image canvas to validate the proposed Perturb-and-Average Scoring method. The results illustrate the challenges of using unconditioned diffusion models and the benefits of strong conditioning texts.

- Demonstrating the application of Score Jacobian Chaining for 3D text-conditioned generation using the pretrained Stable Diffusion model. The results showcase the generation of complex 3D shapes from text prompts.

- Providing analysis to justify the proposed Perturb-and-Average Scoring method and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization techniques.

In summary, the core contribution is a novel method to repurpose a pretrained 2D diffusion model for 3D generation by chaining and propagating the 2D gradients based on the model's score function. The other contributions provide supporting empirical validation, analysis, and evidence for this idea.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main contribution in the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other related work in 3D generative modeling:

- The key idea of lifting a pretrained 2D diffusion model to generate 3D assets is quite novel. Most prior work trains 3D generative models from scratch using 3D supervision, whereas this paper aims to repurpose an existing 2D model. This is an interesting direction that could allow leveraging the rapidly improving 2D models for 3D tasks.

- Compared to other optimization-based 3D models that also utilize 2D guidance like CLIP, this paper uses proper generative models (diffusion models) which seem more suitable for optimization than CLIP. The samples here look more photorealistic than typical CLIP-guided approaches.

- The concurrent work DreamFusion shares a similar high-level approach but differs in some technical details like the formulation and handling of out-of-distribution inputs. Both methods demonstrate promising results.

- Compared to 2D-supervised 3D GANs, this optimization-based approach is slower but provides more control over the 3D structure during generation. The results here also seem higher quality than current GAN methods.

- The proposed method is limited to single object generation, whereas some GANs have tackled scenes. Extending this approach to scenes could be an interesting avenue for future work.

- Overall, the idea of chaining gradients of a 2D model through a renderer Jacobian is novel and powerful. The results demonstrate potential for leveraging 2D models for 3D. More work is needed to scale and refine the approach, but it outlines a promising research direction.

In summary, the key novelty is in "recycling" a 2D model for 3D generation via gradients. The results are compelling compared to prior 3D optimization works, though not yet on par with end-to-end 3D GANs. But the approach opens up intriguing possibilities for the future.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more sophisticated and flexible parameterizations for representing 3D assets, beyond voxel grids. The authors mention potential options like neural radiance fields and implicit surface representations. 

- Developing techniques to better handle matching between the distribution of rendered 2D images and the distribution modeled by the pretrained diffusion model. The out-of-distribution issue identified in the paper remains an open challenge.

- Experimenting with more advanced sampling techniques during the iterative 3D optimization process. The authors point out that using the score for gradient descent does not produce samples that match the quality of standard diffusion sampling. Developing better optimization algorithms tailored for this setup could lead to further improvements.

- Applying the proposed score chaining framework to other types of generative models beyond diffusion models, such as GANs. The general principle of propagating gradients through a renderer could potentially work with other generative modeling techniques.

- Reducing the computational costs associated with rendering and gradient computation to make the overall approach more scalable and efficient.

- Expanding the diversity and fidelity of 3D content that can be generated through richer text conditioning strategies. The authors note current limitations in handling more complex prompts.

- Addressing the need for 3D training data through self-supervised techniques over generated assets rather than relying solely on 2D supervision.

Overall, the paper proposes an interesting approach to repurposing 2D generative models for 3D generation and highlights many promising research avenues to further develop this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to lift a pretrained 2D diffusion model to 3D for generative modeling of radiance fields, without requiring access to 3D training data. The key idea is to interpret diffusion models as learned predictors of gradient fields and apply chain rule to propagate the 2D gradients through the Jacobian of a differentiable volumetric renderer. This aggregates 2D image scores from multiple viewpoints into a 3D score, enabling the 2D model to guide optimization of a 3D voxel radiance field. A key challenge is that naively evaluating the denoising diffusion model on rendered images causes out-of-distribution issues. The authors propose a perturbation-and-average scoring technique to address this. Experiments first validate the approach on a 2D canvas, then demonstrate high-quality text-driven 3D generation by leveraging the pretrained Stable Diffusion model. Comparisons to the concurrent work DreamFusion show competitive qualitative results.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to convert a pretrained 2D diffusion generative model into a 3D generative model, without requiring any 3D training data. The key idea is to interpret diffusion models as learned predictors of gradient vectors, known as score functions. By applying chain rule to the score function, the 2D image gradients can be propagated through the Jacobian of a differentiable renderer to produce 3D gradients on the underlying scene parameters. Specifically, the authors render voxel radiance fields from multiple viewpoints, backpropagate the 2D denoising scores through the volumetric rendering, and aggregate the gradients across views into a 3D score. 

A main challenge is that the denoisers were only trained on noisy inputs, causing out-of-distribution issues when evaluating them on rendered novel view images. To address this, the authors propose a perturbation-based score estimation method that adds noise to the rendered images before passing them into the denoiser. The estimated 3D score is then used to iteratively optimize a radiance field to match an image prompt. Experiments demonstrate that strong 2D generative models like Stable Diffusion can be repurposed to generate compelling 3D content without any 3D training data. Comparisons to concurrent work show competitive qualitative results.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method to repurpose a pretrained 2D diffusion model for 3D generation without access to any 3D training data. 

The key idea is to treat the diffusion model as an estimator of the score function, which is the gradient of the log data density. By applying chain rule, the 2D score on rendered images can be backpropagated through the renderer Jacobian to obtain a 3D score for optimizing radiance fields. 

Specifically, rendered images may be out-of-distribution for the diffusion model. To address this, the authors propose a perturbation-and-average scheme called Perturb-and-Average Scoring (PAAS) to properly estimate the score. The 3D scene is represented as a voxel radiance field and optimized using the chained 3D score from multiple viewpoints. Additional losses are introduced to encourage geometry sparsity.

Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively repurpose a pretrained 2D Stable Diffusion model for generating 3D shapes from text prompts, without explicitly training on 3D data. The results compare favorably to concurrent work DreamFusion.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a method to lift a pretrained 2D image diffusion model to perform 3D generative modeling, without requiring access to any 3D training data. 

- The main idea is to leverage the fact that diffusion models learn a vector field of gradients (scores) on the data distribution. By applying chain rule to propagate these gradients through a differentiable renderer, they can aggregate 2D gradients from multiple viewpoints into a 3D gradient signal.

- Specifically, they use a voxel radiance field as the 3D representation, and optimize it using gradients computed by backpropagating 2D diffusion model scores through the rendering process.

- They identify an out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge that arises when evaluating the denoising diffusion model on non-noisy rendered images. To address this, they propose a perturbation-based score estimation method called Perturb-and-Average Scoring (PAAS).

- They demonstrate their method by lifting pretrained 2D models like Stable Diffusion to generate 3D assets purely from text prompts, producing compelling results on complex shapes like animals and buildings.

In summary, the key contribution is a technique to repurpose powerful 2D generative models like diffusion for 3D tasks, without needing to train on expensive 3D datasets. The technical novelty lies in the gradient propagation framework and handling the OOD challenge when using denoising diffusion models for optimization.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Score Jacobian Chaining (SJC), a method to lift a pretrained 2D diffusion model to 3D for generative modeling of radiance fields, without requiring any 3D training data. The key insight is to interpret diffusion models as predictors of a gradient field, or score function. By applying the chain rule to the predicted 2D scores and propagating them through the Jacobian of a differentiable volumetric renderer, the 2D gradients can be aggregated into a 3D score to guide optimization of a radiance field. A core technical challenge is that diffusion models are typically trained as denoisers, but evaluating them on rendered images leads to an out-of-distribution problem. The paper introduces Perturb-and-Average Scoring to address this issue by adding noise to rendered views before querying the diffusion model and averaging the resulting scores. Experiments validate the approach, including using the recent Stable Diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D assets from text prompts across diverse categories. Comparisons to concurrent work show competitive performance in lifting the same 2D model to 3D.
