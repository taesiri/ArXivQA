# [A novel Fourier neural operator framework for classification of   multi-sized images: Application to 3D digital porous media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11568)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require input images to be of a fixed size, limiting their ability to handle multi-sized images. 
- Fourier neural operators (FNOs) are resolution invariant, meaning they can process images of any size without changing the network architecture. 
- However, connecting FNOs to a classifier for image classification tasks using images of varying sizes remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution
- Introduce a novel FNO-based framework for multi-sized image classification by using static max pooling in the high dimensional Fourier space channel.
- Show application for predicting permeability of 3D porous media images of sizes 40^3, 48^3 and 56^3.
- Compare to an intuitive approach using adaptive max pooling in spatial domain, which fails for multi-sized images.

Key Contributions
- Demonstrate excellent accuracy in classifying the permeability of porous media images of varying sizes using proposed static max pooling approach.
- Conduct sensitivity analysis on key hyperparameters like number of Fourier modes, channel width, activation functions.
- Assess model generalization ability by testing on porous media of unseen sizes like 36^3, 44^3 etc. and achieve strong performance.
- Compare proposed approach to intuitive adaptive max pooling method and show clear superiority for multi-sized image classification task.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to leverage FNO resolution invariance for multi-sized image classification which outperforms intuitive approaches, with excellent accuracy and generalization ability demonstrated for predicting permeability of 3D porous media images.
