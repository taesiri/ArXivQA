# [QAFE-Net: Quality Assessment of Facial Expressions with Landmark   Heatmaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00856)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Assessing the quality and severity of facial expressions is important for monitoring disease progression and treatment effectiveness, especially for conditions like Parkinson's disease (PD) that affect facial expressivity. Prior works have focused on detecting PD or pain from facial expressions, but quantitatively measuring expression quality/severity is still lacking. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a landmarks guided facial expression assessment (LG-FEA) approach with two streams - an RGB stream to extract visual features and a landmarks stream to extract subtle facial muscle movement features from temporal heatmap volumes of facial landmarks. The features from the two streams are fused using a cross-fusion decoder to enhance consistency and guide the RGB features with attentional cues from the landmarks. The fused features are mapped to severity scores using an MLP regressor.

Main Contributions:
1) Encoding temporal landmark heatmaps to assist in capturing subtle facial muscle movements for expression quality measurement
2) Cross-attentional fusion of RGB and landmark heatmap features to generate expression quality scores  
3) Collection and release of PFED5, a new dataset of facial video recordings from PD patients labeled with expression quality scores
4) Proposed LG-FEA method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on PFED5 dataset and achieves better mean absolute error on UNBC-McMaster pain estimation benchmark

The experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed two-stream fused approach to effectively quantify facial expression quality and outperform methods relying only on RGB or simple landmark positions. The introduction of the temporal heatmap volumes provides useful guidance for subtle expression analysis. The new PFED5 dataset enables benchmarking of facial expression quality assessment methods for PD monitoring.
