# [Text-to-Image Diffusion Models are Great Sketch-Photo Matchmakers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores using text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion for the first time as backbones for zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR). ZS-SBIR aims to retrieve photos matching a query sketch from unseen categories not encountered during training. Most prior works use CNNs pretrained on ImageNet or other discriminative tasks as backbones. However, the paper hypothesizes that diffusion models pretrained on text-to-image generation can better bridge the sketch-photo domain gap due to their robust cross-modal capabilities and shape bias.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes adapting a frozen Stable Diffusion model for ZS-SBIR via prompt learning. This allows task-specific adaptation without losing the model's semantic knowledge. Two prompt learning strategies are used - (1) Visual prompts: soft image perturbations to the input images to guide feature extraction; (2) Textual prompts: learnable text embeddings that influence the model's internal representations. The prompts are learned end-to-end with a triplet loss while keeping SD frozen. Additionally, feature ensembling is used during inference for stability.  

For category-level retrieval, earlier SD decoder layers capture coarse semantics and are used. For fine-grained retrieval, latter decoder layers capturing fine details are used. The method can handle both category-level and cross-category fine-grained ZS-SBIR without model fine-tuning.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring text-to-image diffusion models for ZS-SBIR by harnessing their cross-modal transferability.
- Adaptation via prompt learning without fine-tuning the frozen model.
- Suitability for both category-level and fine-grained ZS-SBIR demonstrated through extensive experiments. 
- Significantly outperforms prior ZS-SBIR methods on multiple benchmarks.
- Better stability in low-data regimes owing to diffusion model's generalization ability.
- Extension to leverage available text for enhanced sketch+text based retrieval.

In summary, the paper successfully adapts diffusion models using prompt learning for advanced ZS-SBIR capabilities not shown before.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using the internal representations of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion as effective feature extractors for zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval by adapting them with learned visual and textual prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel pipeline to adapt the frozen Stable Diffusion model as a backbone feature extractor for both category-level and cross-category fine-grained zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR and ZS-FG-SBIR) tasks. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that the internal representations of text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion excel at bridging the gap between sketches and photos, making them well-suited for sketch-based image retrieval. This capability is underpinned by their robust cross-modal features and shape bias.

2) To effectively harness a frozen pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for ZS-SBIR, the paper introduces a straightforward yet powerful strategy focused on selecting optimal feature layers and utilizing visual and textual prompts. This allows adapting the model to the retrieval tasks without fine-tuning or losing pre-trained knowledge.

3) Extensive experiments validate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ZS-SBIR methods on several benchmark datasets for both category-level and fine-grained retrieval. The method also shows strong performance in low-data regimes.

In summary, the main contribution is successfully adapting frozen Stable Diffusion models for zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval by identifying best practices and employing prompt learning, demonstrating marked improvements over existing approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a frozen pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) as the feature extractor backbone for zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval. Why does this model provide benefits over using ImageNet pre-trained discriminative models like VGG or ResNet?

2. The authors use visual prompting to adapt the Stable Diffusion model to the sketch-based retrieval task. Why is prompting used instead of fine-tuning the model? What are the benefits of keeping the model frozen?  

3. The paper finds that different layers of the Stable Diffusion model capture features at different semantic granularities. How does the paper determine which layers are optimal for category-level vs fine-grained retrieval? What analysis is done to justify the layer selections?

4. What modifications or additions need to be made to the standard Stable Diffusion architecture to enable feature extraction, as described in the paper? Explain the feature extraction process.  

5. How exactly does the visual prompting work? What is the design of the visual prompt and how are the prompt parameters optimized? Explain the advantage over standard image inputs.

6. Why is a learnable continuous textual prompt used instead of actual text captions or labels? What benefit does this provide over a fixed discrete label encoding? 

7. The paper uses feature ensembling during inference for improved stability - explain this process. How many ensemble samples are taken and what is the impact on runtime?  

8. How does the method perform in low-data regimes compared to existing state-of-the-art methods? What allows it to generalize well under limited supervision?

9. The paper also extends the method to enable sketch+text based retrieval. How does the framework naturally lend itself to multi-modal retrieval? Compare against other methods.

10. What is the computational and runtime complexity compared to existing state-of-the-art methods? Is there a performance vs efficiency tradeoff?
