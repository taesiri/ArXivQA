# [Robust Stochastic Graph Generator for Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of explainability for graph classification models. Specifically, it tackles the challenge of generating counterfactual explanations for graph classification models, which are inherently uninterpretable "black-box" models. Counterfactual explanations aim to explain a model's predictions by generating a modified version of the input that changes the prediction to a different class. However, existing methods for graph counterfactual explanation have limitations such as relying on heuristics, being confined to the data distribution, requiring access to the model during testing, and struggling with complex graph topologies. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new method called "Robust Stochastic Graph Generator for Counterfactual Explanations (RSGG-CE)" for generating counterfactual graph explanations. The key ideas are:

1) Uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to learn a latent representation of graphs that can generate counterfactual examples. This avoids reliance on heuristics or the data distribution.

2) Exploits the generator's learned latent space at inference time to stochastically sample plausible counterfactual candidates. This removes the need to access the model during testing. 

3) Introduces a "partial order sampling" strategy to identify sets of edges that should be sampled first to effectively generate counterfactuals. This handles complex motifs like cycles.

4) Conditions the counterfactual generation on the input graph using the residuals from a graph autoencoder. This keeps counterfactuals similar to the input.

Main Contributions:

1) A new generative approach for graph counterfactual explanation that autonomously learns to perturb inputs.

2) The first technique to use partial order sampling of estimated edge probabilities for counterfactual generation.

3) Demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in correctness, edit distance, and efficiency on complex synthetic and real-world graphs.

4) Thorough ablation studies validating robustness along different graph complexity dimensions.

In summary, the paper presents a novel generative graph counterfactual explanation method that leverages partial order sampling to effectively handle complex motifs and provide correct and efficient counterfactuals. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed RSGG-CE approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel robust stochastic graph generator for counterfactual explanations (RSGG-CE) that produces counterfactual candidates by sampling edges from a learned latent space using a partially ordered generation sequence, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on graph classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel method called "RSGG-CE" (Robust Stochastic Graph Generator for Counterfactual Explanations). Specifically:

- RSGG-CE is able to produce counterfactual examples by sampling from the learned latent space of a generator network, using a partial order sampling strategy. This allows generating multiple counterfactual candidates for an input graph.

- It combines the input graph edges with generated residual weighted edges, enabling both edge addition and removal operations to produce counterfactuals. This allows handling cases where counterfactuals require shifts between very different graph structures (e.g. cyclic vs acyclic graphs).

- It is a zero-shot counterfactual generation method, meaning it can generate counterfactuals for new, unseen graphs without needing to retrain. This is achieved by learning a latent graph representation that captures stochastic estimations of graph topology.

- The introduced partial order sampling strategy prioritizes sampling of edges that are more likely to result in valid counterfactuals, making the approach more robust.

In summary, the main contribution is a new generative graph counterfactual explanation method that can efficiently produce multiple counterfactual candidates by sampling from a learned latent space, while being zero-shot and robust in generating valid counterfactuals.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Counterfactual explanations - The paper focuses on generating counterfactual explanations to provide insights into AI system predictions. Counterfactuals show how changing the input leads to a different output from a model.

- Graph counterfactual explanations (GCE) - Specifically, the paper deals with counterfactual explanations for graph data, referred to as graph counterfactual explanations or GCEs. These generate a modified graph similar to the original that produces a different outcome from the predictive model.

- Generative counterfactual explainers - The paper proposes a generative approach to producing counterfactual examples, where the explainer model learns to generate modified inputs that yield alternative outcomes. This is contrasted with heuristic and search-based GCE techniques.

- Robust stochastic graph generator (RSGG) - The proposed method is called a robust stochastic graph generator, indicating it is a generative graph model that introduces randomness to produce diverse counterfactual graphs.

- Latent space sampling - Key to the approach is sampling the learned latent space of the generator network to reconstruct counterfactual graphs, rather than being confined to the data distribution.

- Partial order sampling - A novel partial order sampling strategy is introduced to sample estimated edge probabilities in an informed order during counterfactual generation.

So in summary, key terms revolve around counterfactual explanation, particularly for graphs, using a robust generative approach with latent space and partial order sampling.
