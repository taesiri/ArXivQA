# [TWIG: Towards pre-hoc Hyperparameter Optimisation and Cross-Graph   Generalisation via Simulated KGE Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) are widely used to model biomedical data, but have some major limitations:
  - They only use a small "receptive field" of data to make predictions
  - Their learning is driven by memorizing graph structure rather than learning latent semantics
  - Finding optimal hyperparameters requires extensive searching

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a neural network called TWIG that can simulate KGE model outputs using only graph structure and hyperparameters as input
  - Does not use any node/edge embeddings
  - Much smaller number of parameters than KGE models
- Test TWIG on state-of-the-art ComplEx-N3 model and UMLS biomedical dataset

Main Contributions:
- TWIG accurately simulates ComplEx-N3 model output across all hyperparameter settings using only 0.0088% as many parameters 
- Provides evidence for three hypotheses:
  - Structural Learning Hypothesis: KGEs only learn to summarize graph structure, not latent semantics
  - Hyperparameter Determinism Hypothesis: Optimal hyperparameters are a deterministic function of graph structure and model
  - TWIG Hypothesis: Embeddings may not be needed at all for link prediction
- Proposes the Structural Generalization Hypothesis that methods like TWIG could generalize across knowledge graphs

Limitations:
- Only tested on one model (ComplEx-N3) and one dataset (UMLS)
- Further validation needed on broader range of models and datasets

Future Work:
- Expand validation to additional models and datasets
- Further explore the theoretical hypotheses put forward in the paper
- Test whether TWIG-like methods can fully solve link prediction, not just simulate KGE output
