## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deepfakes are highly realistic fake videos created by AI that threaten information integrity. Although deepfake detection methods have been developed, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - small perturbations to inputs that cause misclassification.  
- Defending against adversarial attacks in deepfake detection remains challenging as including fake images in training often reduces discrimination between real and fake. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Adversarial Feature Similarity Learning (AFSL) to make deepfake detection robust against adversarial attacks while preserving performance on clean data.

- The method has 3 components:
  1) Deepfake classification loss to separate real and fake examples
  2) Adversarial similarity loss to make detector robust by bringing clean examples and their adversarial versions closer in feature space
  3) Similarity regularization loss to maximize separation between real and fake examples

- The final loss function combines these 3 losses.

Main Contributions:
- Novel adversarial training framework for adversarially robust deepfake detection using feature similarity learning
- Outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against strong white-box and black-box attacks
- Achieves robust generalization across different deepfake techniques and datasets
- Withstands common video distortions and preserves performance on clean data
- Ablation study validates the impact of different loss components
  
The method tackles a critical challenge in deepfake detection using an innovative similarity learning approach for adversarial robustness, with extensive experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel loss function called Adversarial Feature Similarity Learning (AFSL) that improves the robustness of deepfake detectors against adversarial attacks by optimizing the similarity of features between real samples, fake samples, and their adversarial counterparts while maximizing the dissimilarity between features of real and fake samples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel loss function called Adversarial Feature Similarity Learning (AFSL) to enhance the robustness of deepfake detectors against adversarial attacks. Specifically:

- It introduces a loss function that optimizes similarity across three paradigms: between samples and weight vectors to differentiate real vs fake, between adversarially perturbed and unperturbed examples regardless of their real/fake nature, and introduces a regularization that maximizes dissimilarity between real and fake samples. 

- Through extensive experiments on popular deepfake datasets, it shows the proposed method outperforms standard adversarial training-based defenses by a significant margin in defending against various white-box and black-box attacks.

- It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in helping deepfake detectors fight against adversarial attacks, while preserving performance on unperturbed data.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new loss function that enhances robustness of deepfake detectors against adversarial attacks, through optimizing similarity and dissimilarity across different paradigms. Experiments validate its effectiveness in defending against attacks compared to prior arts.
