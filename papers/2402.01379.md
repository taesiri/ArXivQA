# [Regularized boosting with an increasing coefficient magnitude stop   criterion as meta-learner in hyperparameter optimization stacking ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to find optimal hyperparameters to improve model performance. Typically only the best hyperparameter configuration is chosen and the rest discarded. 
- Ensembling models from different hyperparameter configurations can improve performance but there is limited advice on adequate ensemble methods for HPO.
- Stacking ensemble has potential as it includes a learning procedure (meta-learner) but choosing an appropriate meta-learner is challenging, especially avoiding problems from multicollinearity between model predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper studies non-hyperparametric meta-learners for stacking ensemble in HPO, including forward selection regression (FSR), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS) and boosting (BST).
- A novel regularized boosting (RBST) method is proposed as the meta-learner, which adds an implicit regularization to BST to smooth influence of early selected features.
- A new non-hyperparametric stop criterion called Increasing Coefficient Magnitude (ICM) is introduced, specifically designed for BST and RBST in HPO context.

Main Contributions:
- Exhaustive analysis of possible non-hyperparametric meta-learners for stacking ensemble in HPO.
- Proposal of RBST meta-learner with implicit regularization to allow highly correlated features to contribute to the ensemble.
- Introduction of tailored ICM stop criterion for BST and RBST based on regression coefficients rather than just error values.
- Demonstration that the combination of RBST and ICM outperforms other meta-learners for stacking ensemble in HPO across various base-learners and sampling strategies.

In summary, the key novelty is the specially designed RBST meta-learner with ICM stop criterion to effectively exploit stacking ensemble for improving performance in hyperparameter optimization.
