# [Classifying All Interacting Pairs in a Single Shot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04360)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new human-object interaction (HOI) detection method called HIBISCUS that can estimate all possible HOI triplets in a single forward pass through a multi-task convolutional neural network. The key idea is to use metric learning to cluster features of interacting human-object pairs while pushing non-interacting pairs apart in the embedding space. This allows detecting interactions with constant complexity rather than depending on the number of candidate pairs. Specifically, the model has three complementary task outputs: verb classification, target presence estimation, and an embedding to associate subjects and objects. The embedding is learned separately for each verb, gathering positive pairs close and pushing negative pairs away in the space. At inference, any off-the-shelf object detector can provide candidates that are then matched based on the learned embedding space. Experiments on V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while being far more efficient, with order of magnitude speedups thanks to the constant complexity. A key advantage is that HIBISCUS complexity stays constant regardless of the scene complexity, unlike prior methods that have quadratic growth in run time. The results thus showcase a new approach to HOI detection that is scalable to complex real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new human-object interaction detection approach called HIBISCUS that can estimate all interactions between all humans and objects in an image simultaneously in a single pass, with complexity independent of the number of objects and interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new human-object interaction detection approach named HIBISCUS (Classifying ALl Interacting Pairs in a Single shOt) that can estimate all interactions between all human subjects and objects in an image simultaneously with a single pass through the network. This allows the method to have a constant complexity independent of the number of subjects, objects or interactions present in the image, making it highly scalable. The key ideas enabling this are:

1) Using a multi-task network with three complementary tasks - verb prediction, target presence estimation, and an embedding task to associate interacting subjects and objects.

2) Performing these prediction tasks densely on a grid of anchors over the image rather than just on detected candidate pairs. 

3) Introducing an object-centric passive verb prediction to improve results.

The method shows competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmark datasets while being far more efficient computationally as it runs in constant time regardless of interactions present.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the motivation behind proposing a single-shot interaction classifier that estimates all interactions simultaneously? Why is this an improvement over existing multi-shot approaches?

2. Explain the overview of the proposed HIBISCUS architecture. What are the different components and how do they work together for interaction detection?

3. What are the three complementary tasks learned by the interaction module? Explain each of them in detail. 

4. Explain the formulation and objectives of the embedding task for mapping interacting subjects and targets to a common representation. 

5. What is the purpose of having separate embedding spaces for each interaction verb? What flexibility does this provide over having a common embedding for all verbs?

6. How does the target presence estimation task help in determining interactions? Why is directly thresholding the learned metric not sufficient?

7. What is the purpose of the passive voice verb estimation? Why does it help improve performance?

8. At inference, external detectors are used to identify candidate boxes. Explain the complete pipeline to go from detector outputs to predicting final HOI triplets.

9. What makes HIBISCUS computationally more efficient than prior state-of-the-art methods? Analyze its computational complexity.

10. The performance improves when using ground truth boxes rather than detected boxes. What does this indicate - is interaction detection still an unsolved challenge? What future improvements do you suggest?
