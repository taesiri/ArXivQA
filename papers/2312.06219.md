## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new interpretable long term waypoint-driven trajectory prediction framework called WayDCM for predicting future trajectories of dynamic agents like vehicles. The key idea is that agents' motions are influenced not just by their past trajectories and environment, but also by their long-term destinations. To capture this, WayDCM predicts intermediate goals using a combination of a discrete choice model (DCM) and a neural network, taking into account interactions with the environment and long-term waypoints. The DCM component allows for interpretable outputs to validate the neural network. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate improved performance over baselines by incorporating long-term waypoints into trajectory prediction. The estimated DCM parameters confirm the significance of the distance and angle to long-term destinations in influencing intermediate goal choices. This represents an initial foray into utilizing long-term intents in motion forecasting, and suggests their value as inputs alongside short-term history and context. The authors motivate future work to explore different ways to integrate long-term goals using more interactive datasets. Overall, this paper makes a case for the importance of far-off objectives in determining dynamic agents' imminent motions.
