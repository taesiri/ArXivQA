# [Interpretable Long Term Waypoint-Based Trajectory Prediction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06219)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new interpretable long term waypoint-driven trajectory prediction framework called WayDCM for predicting future trajectories of dynamic agents like vehicles. The key idea is that agents' motions are influenced not just by their past trajectories and environment, but also by their long-term destinations. To capture this, WayDCM predicts intermediate goals using a combination of a discrete choice model (DCM) and a neural network, taking into account interactions with the environment and long-term waypoints. The DCM component allows for interpretable outputs to validate the neural network. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate improved performance over baselines by incorporating long-term waypoints into trajectory prediction. The estimated DCM parameters confirm the significance of the distance and angle to long-term destinations in influencing intermediate goal choices. This represents an initial foray into utilizing long-term intents in motion forecasting, and suggests their value as inputs alongside short-term history and context. The authors motivate future work to explore different ways to integrate long-term goals using more interactive datasets. Overall, this paper makes a case for the importance of far-off objectives in determining dynamic agents' imminent motions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an interpretable long term waypoint-driven prediction framework (WayDCM) that first predicts an agent's intermediate goal by encoding its interactions and long term waypoint using a combination of a Discrete Choice Model and a Neural Network, then predicts the corresponding trajectories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new approach to solve the trajectory prediction problem by using a long term waypoint. Specifically:

- The paper introduces an interpretable model (WayDCM) that includes a long term waypoint of the agent to help predict its future trajectory. This is the first work to incorporate long term waypoint information into a trajectory prediction framework.

- The paper studies the impact of adding long term waypoint information on the predicted trajectories and shows it can improve performance.

- The paper argues that long term waypoints should be included in motion prediction datasets as they provide important cues for where agents are heading.

- A simple approach is proposed to include the long term waypoint through a discrete choice model (DCM) that is combined with a neural network.

In summary, the key insight is that knowing an agent's eventual destination can help better predict their path to get there. This paper proposes a way to incorporate that through the long term waypoint and opens up discussion on including such information in datasets and prediction models.

The paper proposes an interpretable framework called WayDCM for long term waypoint-based trajectory prediction. It combines a discrete choice model and a neural network to predict an agent's intermediate goal based on its long term destination. This is then used to forecast multimodal trajectory distributions. The method is evaluated on the Waymo dataset for autonomous driving applications. The key ideas focus on incorporating long term goals and interpretability into trajectory prediction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that "we are the first to introduce the idea of a long term waypoint to a trajectory prediction framework". What is the intuition behind using the long term waypoint information for trajectory prediction? How does it help capture agent behavior better compared to existing methods?

2. The utility function in the discrete choice model contains several components - direction, occupancy, collision avoidance etc. Why are the distance and angle to the long term waypoint especially important components to add in the utility function? 

3. The estimated parameters in Table 2 show that the distance and angle to the long term waypoint have the highest absolute values. What does this indicate about their significance in predicting the intermediate goal?

4. The paper evaluates the method on the Waymo dataset since it has a longer prediction horizon of 8 seconds. What modifications would be needed to evaluate the approach on other datasets with shorter horizons? 

5. The social tensor encoding using multi-head self attention aims to capture interactions between agents. However, the occupancy and collision avoidance parameters are close to 0. Why do you think these interaction terms did not turn out to be significant?

6. The method outperforms LSTM and attention-based baselines but is comparable to other recent methods like MultiPath++. What further improvements could help the performance against other state-of-the-art approaches?  

7. The interpretable outputs are useful for validating and debugging the neural network components. What other ways could the discrete choice model outputs be utilized - both during training and inference?

8. The paper focuses on vehicles/autonomous driving. How challenging would it be to apply the same approach to pedestrian trajectory prediction? What components of the method may need changing?

9. The model complexity is lower since map information is not used. What would be the tradeoffs in incorporating map context into the model? Would the gains outweigh the complexity?

10. The introduction mentions that conditioning on goals helps handle multimodality better. Does the proposed method also capture multiple plausible trajectories well? How could the multimodal modeling be improved?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting future trajectories of agents (e.g. vehicles) is important for applications like autonomous driving, but is challenging due to behavioral uncertainties and multimodality of possible futures. 
- Most prior works do not consider the agent's long-term goal/destination, which is an important factor influencing their movement.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a model called WayDCM that incorporates the agent's long term waypoint (LTW) to predict their intermediate goal (IG) and corresponding future trajectory.
- Combines an interpretable discrete choice model (DCM) with a neural network (NN). DCM part models behavior using hand-designed functions based on domain knowledge.
- Utility function in DCM now includes terms related to LTW - minimizing angle and distance to it. NN part captures complex interactions.
- Predicts distribution over discrete IGs first using this hybrid model. Then uses IGs to produce multiple plausible future trajectories.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce concept of long term waypoint in trajectory prediction, study its impact. Argue it should be included in datasets.
- Propose interpretable model combing DCM and NN that incorporates LTW information for prediction.
- Add terms in DCM utility function related to minimizing distance and angle to LTW.
- Evaluate on Waymo dataset. Show including LTW improves performance over their prior work and other baselines.
- More interpretable with LTW importance clear from learned DCM weights.

In summary, they show long term goals are an important and overlooked factor in trajectory prediction, and propose a hybrid interpretable method that incorporates this through a utility function based DCM.
