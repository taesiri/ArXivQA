# [HawkEye: Training Video-Text LLMs for Grounding Text in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video-text large language models (LLMs) perform poorly on understanding temporal information in long, complex videos. This is a major limitation as temporal reasoning is critical for video understanding.  

- Tasks like temporal video grounding require localizing video segments given text queries. But current LLMs perform as good as random on such tasks.

- Lack of large-scale training data and suitable model training objectives for temporal video grounding also contribute to poor LLM performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct InternVid-G, a new large-scale video corpus with 715k segment-level captions and marked negative spans for temporal grounding training.

- Propose a coarse-grained video segment representation using "beginning", "middle", "end" choices that is easier for LLMs to learn than precise timestamps.  

- Introduce two new time-aware training objectives - temporal video grounding and video segment captioning based on InternVid-G.

- Use recursive grounding method to achieve precise start and end timestamps for localization through multiple rounds of coarse localization.

- Train HawkEye, a video-text LLM with enhanced temporal grounding abilities while preserving general video understanding skills.


Main Contributions:
- InternVid-G - a large video dataset for temporal grounding training

- Effective video segment representation and recursive grounding method for temporal localization

- Novel time-aware training approaches to improve video-text LLM temporal reasoning 

- HawkEye outperforms prior video-text LLMs on temporal video grounding while matching versatility on other tasks

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of inadequate temporal reasoning abilities in video-text LLMs through targeted data, training strategies and inference techniques to achieve state-of-the-art temporal video grounding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes HawkEye, a video-text large language model that can perform temporal video grounding in a fully text-to-text manner by using a coarse-grained method to represent video segments and constructing a large-scale time-aware video dataset InternVid-G for training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes HawkEye, one of the first video-text large language models (LLMs) that can perform temporal video grounding in a fully text-to-text manner. 

2. It constructs InternVid-G, a large-scale video-text corpus with segment-level captions and negative spans, which is suitable for constructing temporal video grounding training samples.

3. It introduces two new time-aware training objectives - temporal video grounding and video segment captioning - to enhance temporal understanding abilities of video-text LLMs.

4. It proposes a coarse-grained method to represent segments in videos, which is more robust and easier for LLMs to learn and follow compared to alternatives like frame-level or second-level representations. 

5. It proposes a recursive grounding technique to achieve precise localization of video segments through multiple rounds of judgements using the coarse-grained representation.

6. Extensive experiments show HawkEye performs substantially better than other video-text LLMs on temporal video grounding while still maintaining strong performance on other tasks, demonstrating its superior video-text understanding abilities.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing ideas and practices to enhance the temporal video grounding ability of video-text LLMs, and verifying their effectiveness by training and evaluating HawkEye.

The paper focuses on improving the ability of video-text large language models to perform temporal video grounding - localizing text queries in long videos by finding the start and end timestamps. Key ideas proposed include using a coarse-grained text representation to refer to video segments, recursive grounding to iteratively localize segments, constructing the InternVid-G dataset for time-aware training, and adding new temporal grounding and segment captioning objectives. The model trained is called HawkEye and is evaluated on various video QA tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a "coarse-grained" representation to represent video segments instead of precise start and end timestamps. What is the rationale behind this design choice? What are the trade-offs?

2. The paper constructs a new dataset called InternVid-G. What are the key differences between this dataset and existing video-text datasets? What makes it more suitable for temporal video grounding?

3. Explain the negative span mining process used to construct hard negatives in InternVid-G. Why is this an important step? How does it help generate better training samples? 

4. The paper proposes a recursive grounding technique. Walk through an example of how this allows localizing a short segment over multiple rounds. What are the limitations of this approach?

5. HawkEye is initialized from VideoChat2 and further trained with additional objectives on InternVid-G. Analyze the training methodology. Does this incremental approach have advantages over training from scratch?

6. Compare and contrast the temporal video grounding performance of HawkEye with other methods. What contributes most to its superior performance? The model architecture, the training data or the representation method?

7. The paper shows temporal video grounding of questions on NExT-GQA. Why is this an important and challenging problem? How does HawkEye perform in this setting compared to other methods? 

8. Explain the random cropping strategy used when formatting the temporal video grounding tasks. Why is this helpful beyond simply augmenting data?

9. Analyze the robustness experiments with varying number of input frames. Why do you think the coarse-grained representation performs better than alternatives in this regard?

10. The paper focuses specifically on improving temporal understanding in video-text models. What other capabilities would you suggest enhancing to make video-text LLMs more versatile and useful?
