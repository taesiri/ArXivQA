# [Automated interpretation of congenital heart disease from multi-view   echocardiograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18788)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an automated system for interpreting congenital heart disease (CHD) from multi-view echocardiogram videos. The authors collect a dataset of 1,308 pediatric echocardiogram videos across 5 standard views, with labels for ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), and healthy controls. They develop convolutional neural network models to jointly analyze the 5 views to diagnose CHD, using depthwise separable convolutions to reduce parameters. A key-frame based model achieves 95.4% accuracy for binary classification of CHD, and 92.3% accuracy for 3-class classification of negative/VSD/ASD cases. To eliminate costly key-frame selection, they also propose an attention-based aggregation module to directly process raw videos, achieving 93.9% binary and 92.1% 3-class accuracy without any key-frame or view labels at test time. The visualization demonstrates the model focuses on cardiologically relevant regions. The automated interpretation of multi-view echocardiograms could assist clinicians, especially in low-resource primary care settings, to improve early CHD diagnosis and referral rates.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework for automated diagnosis of congenital heart disease from multi-view echocardiograms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors collect the first large scale CHD dataset for five-view two-dimensional echocardiograms analysis. Both the raw video and key-frame labeled versions are provided. 

2. The paper proposes a series of powerful baseline models to explore both the key-frame-based and video-based multi-view diagnosis. An efficient multi-channel CNN architecture using depthwise separable convolution is proposed that can utilize the limited data to achieve good performance.

3. A novel soft-attention framework is proposed to process the video frames with or without key-frame labels during training. Four video aggregation schemes are investigated.

4. The model achieves high diagnostic accuracy on the collected dataset. For the key-frame model, it diagnoses CHD with 95.4% accuracy (binary classification) and 92.3% accuracy (3-class). For the video model, it achieves 93.9% (binary) and 92.1% (3-class) without needing key-frame selection or view annotation during testing.

5. The visualized attention maps demonstrate the interpretability of the model predictions.

In summary, the main contributions are around collecting a new multi-view CHD dataset, developing efficient models for diagnosis from standard views or raw video, and demonstrating strong performance. The models and analysis provide a good foundation for future clinical applications.
