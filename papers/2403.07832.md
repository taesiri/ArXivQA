# [DeliGrasp: Inferring Object Mass, Friction, and Compliance with LLMs for   Adaptive and Minimally Deforming Grasp Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07832)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional robot grasping methods cannot handle delicate, deformable objects well such as origami, plastic bags with items inside, or ripe fruits/vegetables. 
- Methods exist for grasping some delicate objects using custom sensing and adaptive force control models but are limited to specific object sets.  
- There is a need for adaptive grasp skills that can work for a wide variety of delicate objects in open-world settings like supermarkets with constantly changing items.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage large language models (LLMs) to infer physical properties like mass, friction, compliance of arbitrary objects from their descriptions. 
- Use these inferred properties to parameterize an adaptive grasping controller that detects slippage and minimally deforms objects.
- Query the LLM to generate full adaptive grasp policies as executable Python code using a structured prompt.
- Show that LLM-based grasps outperform traditional methods on a custom benchmark of 12 delicate items.
- Also use the gripper as a compliance sensor to measure fruit ripeness for downstream reasoning.

Main Contributions:
- A method to query LLMs to infer appropriate physical parameters for delicate object grasping 
- An adaptive grasping algorithm using LLM estimates of mass, friction, compliance
- Controller detects slippage, increases grip force, measures compliance
- LLM-generated grasp policies succeed on delicate origami, foods, fruits etc. where traditional grasps fail
- Compliance sensing enables querying LLM for appropriate uses based on ripeness
- Enables grasping delicate objects with minimal deformation in open-world settings

In summary, the key idea is using LLMs' common sense knowledge to plan appropriate grasping forces and behaviors for delicate objects, allowing minimally-deforming pickups across a range of masses and compliances. Compliance feedback further aids downstream decision making.
