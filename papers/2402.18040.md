# [Automated Discovery of Integral with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18040)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving complex math problems and coding challenges. However, this is very different from actually making scientific discoveries, which requires more nuanced understanding. 
- The paper explores how deep learning could be used to rediscover a fundamental mathematical concept - integrals - without providing the models any prior examples or knowledge about integrals.

Proposed Solution:
- Define integrals as area under the curve of a function. Provide models the ability to evaluate functions and calculate area under curves numerically.  
- Use symbolic regression to take numerical integral values and infer symbolic mathematical expressions. Filter out inaccurate cases.
- Train autoregressive (GPT) and sequence-to-sequence (Transformer) models on function-integral pairs from symbolic regression to directly predict integrals from functions.
- Design a "rule search system" that can automatically find basic integral rules relating function coefficients to integral coefficients.

Main Contributions:
- Showed neural models can learn to infer integrals with high accuracy (~80-95% correct), outperforming symbolic regression, using just a definition of integrals as area under curves.
- Designed a system to automatically deduce basic integral rules, like polynomials and exponential/trigonometric functions, solely from data without human input.
- Demonstrated a methodology for neural discovery of a fundamental mathematical concept without relying on any human-solved examples or prior knowledge.
- Sets stage for using deep learning for more complex undiscovered mathematical or scientific knowledge, augmenting human researchers.

In summary, the paper presents a novel experiment in training neural models to gain integral calculus abilities from the ground up, laying early groundwork towards more ambitious automated discovery goals.
