# [Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models can generate high-quality images from noise, but require many sampling steps during inference which is computationally expensive. 
- Rectified flow models connect data and noise in a straight line which allows faster sampling, but have not been decisively established as superior in practice yet.
- Existing approaches for text-to-image synthesis use a fixed text representation as input which limits model performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new noise distributions for training rectified flows that focus more on intermediate noise scales.
- Propose a novel transformer architecture (MM-DiT) that handles text and images with separate sets of weights and enables better mixing.
- Scale up models to 8 billion parameters using improved training techniques.

Key Contributions:
- Systematic large-scale study comparing diffusion and rectified flow models, demonstrating superior performance of proposed rectified flow formulation.
- New MM-DiT architecture outperforms existing backbones like UViT and DiT for text-to-image synthesis.
- Scaling study up to 8B parameters showing predictable trends and strong correlation between lower validation loss and better text-to-image metrics.
- Largest model with 8B parameters sets new state-of-the-art for text-to-image generation, outperforming DALL-E 3 and other existing models.

In summary, the paper introduces improvements in rectified flow training and architectures for text-to-image models, and shows through extensive experiments that these advances enable scaling up models to 8B parameters with excellent results, setting a new state-of-the-art.
