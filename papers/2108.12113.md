# [Subjective Learning for Open-Ended Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12113)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can we develop an effective supervised learning framework to handle open-ended data that may contain samples from multiple disparate domains/tasks? The key hypotheses are:1) Open-ended data exhibits a different structure from conventional supervised data due to its potential mixture of samples from multiple domains/tasks. This difference can be characterized by a notion called "mapping rank".2) A single global model is insufficient for capturing all input-output relations in open-ended data. Instead, multiple models are needed to handle data from different domains/tasks. 3) An explicit data allocation mechanism is required to assign data samples to suitable models in order to resolve the conflicts between different domains/tasks. This allocation mechanism acts like a "subjective function", mimicking human subjectivity in the manual data arrangement process.4) With a proper subjective function and multiple candidate models, it is possible to develop an effective supervised learning framework termed Open-ended Supervised Learning (OSL) for handling open-ended data without additional human intervention.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by introducing the concepts of mapping rank and subjective function to handle the multi-domain/multi-task nature of open-ended data, the proposed OSL framework can enable effective learning from such data. Theoretical analysis and empirical validation are provided to support this hypothesis.
