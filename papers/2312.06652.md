# [Building Domain-Specific LLMs Faithful To The Islamic Worldview: Mirage   or Technical Possibility?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06652)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores the technical possibilities and challenges of building large language models (LLMs) aligned with Islamic beliefs and values. It frames this as an important goal given the impressive capabilities of LLMs today and the need to represent Islam accurately. The authors review related work, including known issues of bias and hallucination in current LLMs as well as techniques like prompt engineering and fine-tuning to adapt models for specific domains. They then systematically present and evaluate various approaches to construct an LLM faithful to the Islamic viewpoint, rooted in the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad. These include specialized evaluation metrics and datasets, different prompting strategies to constrain model behavior, retrieval-based systems to cite authentic text, and fine-tuning on Islamic data. The combination of fine-tuning and prompt engineering produced the best results, while guardrails are also suggested to filter out malicious content. There is a focus on rigorously defining and evaluating the challenge, drawing on both Islamic scholarship and latest ML capabilities. The authors conclude more research is needed to improve each system component and address inherent semantic and technical complexities when representing the nuanced spectrum of Islamic knowledge.
