# [Building Domain-Specific LLMs Faithful To The Islamic Worldview: Mirage   or Technical Possibility?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper focuses on the challenge of building domain-specific large language models (LLMs) that align with Islamic principles and teachings from the Quran and Sunnah. Such models have the potential for useful applications but also risk misrepresenting or misusing Islam if not developed carefully. 

Proposed Solutions
The paper explores various technical approaches to develop an LLM dialog system faithful to Islam:

- Prompt engineering using GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and LLAMA models with zero-shot, few-shot and instruction-based prompting. Few-shot prompting works best.  

- Retrieval-augmented generation using hadith datasets to ensure responses cite authentic texts. But this shows limited improvement over few-shot prompting.

- Fine-tuning models on Islamic datasets like hadiths and scholarly QA. This further improves performance when combined with few-shot prompting.

- Using guardrails to ensure robustness against malicious inputs.

Key Contributions  
- Frames the problem of building Islamically-aligned LLMs as a technical challenge.
- Evaluates different models and prompting strategies for this task using precision, recall and semantic similarity.   
- Shows fine-tuning and few-shot prompting gives best results.
- Discusses datasets, evaluation methods and epistemological limitations in representing Islamic knowledge.
- Calls for interdisciplinary work between ML and Islamic scholarship in this area.

The paper provides a methodology and benchmark for developing and evaluating LLMs optimized for the Islamic domain. It highlights the need for quality data and evaluations, and blending technical and religious expertise.
