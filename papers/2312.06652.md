# [Building Domain-Specific LLMs Faithful To The Islamic Worldview: Mirage   or Technical Possibility?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper focuses on the challenge of building domain-specific large language models (LLMs) that align with Islamic principles and teachings from the Quran and Sunnah. Such models have the potential for useful applications but also risk misrepresenting or misusing Islam if not developed carefully. 

Proposed Solutions
The paper explores various technical approaches to develop an LLM dialog system faithful to Islam:

- Prompt engineering using GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and LLAMA models with zero-shot, few-shot and instruction-based prompting. Few-shot prompting works best.  

- Retrieval-augmented generation using hadith datasets to ensure responses cite authentic texts. But this shows limited improvement over few-shot prompting.

- Fine-tuning models on Islamic datasets like hadiths and scholarly QA. This further improves performance when combined with few-shot prompting.

- Using guardrails to ensure robustness against malicious inputs.

Key Contributions  
- Frames the problem of building Islamically-aligned LLMs as a technical challenge.
- Evaluates different models and prompting strategies for this task using precision, recall and semantic similarity.   
- Shows fine-tuning and few-shot prompting gives best results.
- Discusses datasets, evaluation methods and epistemological limitations in representing Islamic knowledge.
- Calls for interdisciplinary work between ML and Islamic scholarship in this area.

The paper provides a methodology and benchmark for developing and evaluating LLMs optimized for the Islamic domain. It highlights the need for quality data and evaluations, and blending technical and religious expertise.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores technical approaches and challenges for developing large language models aligned with Islamic principles, evaluating various methods like prompt engineering, retrieval augmentation, and fine-tuning using curated Islamic datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing approaches and evaluation methodologies for building domain-specific large language models (LLMs) that are faithful to the Islamic worldview. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Frames the goal of creating LLMs aligned with Islamic principles as a technical problem and explores potential solutions like prompt engineering, retrieval-based augmentation, fine-tuning, and guardrails.

- Evaluates various LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA) on an Islamic QA dataset using metrics like BERTScore, cosine similarity, precision, recall to assess their fidelity. 

- Finds that few-shot prompting works best across models. Fine-tuning on Islamic texts leads to further improvements.

- Discusses challenges in representing the diversity of Islamic scholarship and interpreting original texts.

- Calls for high-quality Islamic datasets, interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and Islamic studies, and rigorous evaluations to develop and validate such systems.

So in summary, it formulates the problem, proposes techniques, evaluates models, and outlines next steps towards developing reliable domain-specific LLMs aligned with Islamic beliefs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using instruction-based prompting as a technique for developing a dialogue system aligned with Islamic principles. What are some of the key components and considerations when crafting effective instruction-based prompts for this context? How can the prompts encode nuanced behavioral guidelines while allowing for open-ended conversations?

2. The paper evaluates different prompting techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction-based prompting across models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA-7B, and LLAMA-70B. What factors contribute to the superior performance of few-shot prompting? Why does instruction-based prompting, despite encoding more explicit guidelines, underperform on quantitative metrics?

3. The paper explores retrieval-augmented generation using the Hadith dataset for improving answer accuracy. However, only marginal improvements are observed. What aspects of the RAG implementation could have contributed to the lack of significant gains? How can the indexing, embedding, retrieval and generation stages be enhanced? 

4. Fine-tuning is proposed as an effective technique for domain adaptation. The paper shows GPT-3.5 fine-tuned on Hadiths and Islamic QA questions achieves the best results. What trade-offs need to be considered in curating fine-tuning datasets between coverage and noise? How does the choice of pre-training dataset impact downstream fine-tuning performance?

5. Although the technical approach focuses primarily on answer accuracy, how can the notion of faithfulness to the Islamic worldview be made more concrete when developing such dialogue systems? What other ethical and social considerations come into play?

6. The paper acknowledges differences of opinion between schools of theology and jurisprudence in Islam. How can the system design account for and represent this diversity of viewpoints where disagreements exist? What evaluation protocols can assess viewpoint coverage?

7. Apart from BERTScore, embedding distance and F1 score, what other semantic evaluation metrics can evaluate similarity to ground truth responses based on Islamic principles more effectively? What are limitations of existing benchmarks?

8. How effective are techniques like RAIL for ensuring safety and alignment for dialogue systems centered around sensitive topics? What failure modes need to be accounted for when defining validators? 

9. The technical solution relies extensively on language model capabilities. What inherent limitations around reasoning, causality, factuality and logical contradictions need to be considered when generating responses?

10. The paper focuses on English language models whereas Islamic texts originate primarily in Arabic. How can challenges around translation divergence and loss of meaning be addressed? Are multilingual models better suited for this application?
