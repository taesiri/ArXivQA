# [Building Domain-Specific LLMs Faithful To The Islamic Worldview: Mirage   or Technical Possibility?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06652)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores the technical possibilities and challenges of building large language models (LLMs) aligned with Islamic beliefs and values. It frames this as an important goal given the impressive capabilities of LLMs today and the need to represent Islam accurately. The authors review related work, including known issues of bias and hallucination in current LLMs as well as techniques like prompt engineering and fine-tuning to adapt models for specific domains. They then systematically present and evaluate various approaches to construct an LLM faithful to the Islamic viewpoint, rooted in the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad. These include specialized evaluation metrics and datasets, different prompting strategies to constrain model behavior, retrieval-based systems to cite authentic text, and fine-tuning on Islamic data. The combination of fine-tuning and prompt engineering produced the best results, while guardrails are also suggested to filter out malicious content. There is a focus on rigorously defining and evaluating the challenge, drawing on both Islamic scholarship and latest ML capabilities. The authors conclude more research is needed to improve each system component and address inherent semantic and technical complexities when representing the nuanced spectrum of Islamic knowledge.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper focuses on the challenge of building domain-specific large language models (LLMs) that align with Islamic principles and teachings from the Quran and Sunnah. Such models have the potential for useful applications but also risk misrepresenting or misusing Islam if not developed carefully. 

Proposed Solutions
The paper explores various technical approaches to develop an LLM dialog system faithful to Islam:

- Prompt engineering using GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and LLAMA models with zero-shot, few-shot and instruction-based prompting. Few-shot prompting works best.  

- Retrieval-augmented generation using hadith datasets to ensure responses cite authentic texts. But this shows limited improvement over few-shot prompting.

- Fine-tuning models on Islamic datasets like hadiths and scholarly QA. This further improves performance when combined with few-shot prompting.

- Using guardrails to ensure robustness against malicious inputs.

Key Contributions  
- Frames the problem of building Islamically-aligned LLMs as a technical challenge.
- Evaluates different models and prompting strategies for this task using precision, recall and semantic similarity.   
- Shows fine-tuning and few-shot prompting gives best results.
- Discusses datasets, evaluation methods and epistemological limitations in representing Islamic knowledge.
- Calls for interdisciplinary work between ML and Islamic scholarship in this area.

The paper provides a methodology and benchmark for developing and evaluating LLMs optimized for the Islamic domain. It highlights the need for quality data and evaluations, and blending technical and religious expertise.
