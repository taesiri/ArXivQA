# [Compressing Volumetric Radiance Fields to 1 MB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16386)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a framework called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF) for compressing volumetric radiance field models like Plenoxels and DVGO. 

- Volumetric radiance fields methods can be very storage intensive, often requiring hundreds of MB to represent a scene. The goal is to significantly compress these models while maintaining rendering quality.

- The paper presents a 3-stage compression pipeline: voxel pruning to remove redundant voxels, vector quantization to encode features into a compact codebook, and post-processing steps like quantization and entropy encoding. 

- A key contribution is developing an adaptive voxel pruning strategy based on a cumulative importance score metric, which allows pruning to be generalized across scenes and models. 

- Another contribution is the proposed vector quantization method that incorporates voxel importance into codebook learning and allows joint fine-tuning to recover rendering quality after compression.

- Experiments show the framework can compress volumetric models by up to 100x down to 1MB with little loss of rendering quality. The method also generalizes well across datasets and volumetric model architectures.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that an effective compression framework can be developed to significantly reduce the storage requirements of volumetric radiance fields while maintaining high rendering fidelity. The paper presents VQRF as an approach to achieve this goal.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

1. Improving compression efficiency: The authors mention trying more advanced entropy encoding methods like arithmetic coding to further improve compression efficiency. They also suggest exploring neural network-based approaches for more optimized codebook learning. 

2. Perceptual metrics: The authors note that MSE/PSNR may not perfectly correlate with perceptual quality for novel view synthesis. They suggest exploring perceptual metrics and losses like LPIPS to better optimize for visual quality.

3. Model distillation: The authors propose knowledge distillation as a way to train a small network to mimic a compressed volumetric radiance field. This could enable real-time rendering while maintaining quality.

4. Dynamic scenes: The current method focuses on static scenes. The authors suggest extending it to handle dynamic scenes with motion and temporal consistency. This could involve updating codebooks over time.

5. Generalization: While results are shown on multiple datasets, the authors note the method could be validated on more diverse scenes. Ensuring the framework generalizes broadly is an important direction. 

6. Unbounded scenes: Current volumetric methods like the one presented are limited to bounded/medium scenes. Scaling to large unbounded environments remains an open challenge.

In summary, the main future directions are improving compression efficiency, perceptual quality, model distillation, handling dynamics, generalization, and scalability to large scenes. Advancing in these areas could make volumetric radiance field compression even more practical and applicable.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes VQRF, a framework for compressing volumetric radiance fields like Plenoxels and DVGO to reduce their storage requirements while preserving rendering quality. The method has three main steps - voxel pruning, vector quantization, and post-processing. First, less important voxels are pruned based on an adaptive importance score threshold to remove redundancy. Next, vector quantization is used to encode the color features of remaining voxels into a compact codebook, so that multiple voxels can share the same code vector. This significantly reduces the number of bits needed per voxel. Finally, post-processing like weight quantization and entropy encoding further compresses the model. Experiments show VQRF can compress volumetric radiance fields by 100x down to 1MB with negligible loss of rendering quality. The framework is simple yet effective, and generalizes well across scenes, datasets and volumetric radiance field methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF) for compressing volumetric radiance field models such as Plenoxels and DVGO. These volumetric models provide fast training and rendering but require large storage, often hundreds of megabytes. The VQRF framework aims to significantly compress these models while retaining rendering quality. 

The framework has three main steps. First, an adaptive voxel pruning method removes unimportant voxels that contribute little to rendering quality, providing around 8x compression. Next, a vector quantization method further compresses the model by encoding voxel features into a compact shared codebook, achieving around 33x additional compression. Finally, a joint tuning process and postprocessing like weight quantization provide end-to-end compression rates around 100x. Experiments validate the framework generalizes across methods and datasets. For example, a 104MB DVGO model is compressed to 1.05MB with negligible quality loss. The work facilitates widespread use of volumetric radiance fields through highly compressed representations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a compression framework for volumetric radiance fields called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF). The framework has three main steps: voxel pruning, vector quantization, and post-processing. For voxel pruning, they compute an importance score for each voxel based on its contribution to rendering, then adaptively prune voxels below a threshold. For vector quantization, they learn a compact codebook and encode voxel features as indices into the codebook rather than storing features directly. This is optimized via a joint finetuning strategy. Finally, for post-processing they apply weight quantization and entropy encoding to further compress the model. Through this pipeline they are able to compress volumetric radiance field models by around 100x with minimal loss in rendering quality. The method is flexible and achieves strong performance across different volumetric radiance field architectures and datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of high storage costs associated with volumetric radiance field methods for novel view synthesis.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VQRF, a novel framework for compressing volumetric radiance fields to enable their practical use in real-world applications. The key insight is that voxel grids used in volumetric radiance fields contain substantial redundancy. First, the authors introduce an adaptive voxel pruning strategy that omits unimportant voxels based on a robust metric for estimating voxel importance. This pruning alone achieves 5-8x compression with minimal quality loss. To further compress the model, a vector quantization method is proposed to encode the features of remaining important voxels into a compact codebook indexed by the voxels. The compressed model is then jointly fine-tuned with the original model parameters to recover any quality loss from compression. Additional post-processing like weight quantization reduces the model size down to 1MB. Experiments demonstrate that VQRF achieves over 100x compression on various volumetric radiance field methods like DVGO, Plenoxels and TensoRF with negligible visual quality degradation. The framework generalizes well across scenes and base methods, facilitating the practical use of volumetric radiance fields in real applications.
