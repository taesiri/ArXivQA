# [Compressing Volumetric Radiance Fields to 1 MB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16386)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a framework called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF) for compressing volumetric radiance field models like Plenoxels and DVGO. 

- Volumetric radiance fields methods can be very storage intensive, often requiring hundreds of MB to represent a scene. The goal is to significantly compress these models while maintaining rendering quality.

- The paper presents a 3-stage compression pipeline: voxel pruning to remove redundant voxels, vector quantization to encode features into a compact codebook, and post-processing steps like quantization and entropy encoding. 

- A key contribution is developing an adaptive voxel pruning strategy based on a cumulative importance score metric, which allows pruning to be generalized across scenes and models. 

- Another contribution is the proposed vector quantization method that incorporates voxel importance into codebook learning and allows joint fine-tuning to recover rendering quality after compression.

- Experiments show the framework can compress volumetric models by up to 100x down to 1MB with little loss of rendering quality. The method also generalizes well across datasets and volumetric model architectures.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that an effective compression framework can be developed to significantly reduce the storage requirements of volumetric radiance fields while maintaining high rendering fidelity. The paper presents VQRF as an approach to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a framework for compressing volumetric radiance fields. The key points are:

- They propose a voxel pruning method to remove less important voxels and reduce model size. An adaptive importance score threshold is used for pruning to make it generalizable across scenes and models.

- They introduce vector quantization to encode the features of remaining important voxels into a compact codebook, allowing substantial model compression. An iterative optimization strategy is used for codebook learning.

- They propose joint fine-tuning to recover the rendering quality of the compressed model close to the original uncompressed model. 

- Additional techniques like weight quantization and entropy encoding are used as a post-processing step to further reduce model size.

- Extensive experiments show the proposed framework can compress volumetric radiance fields by up to 100x with negligible loss of rendering quality. The method demonstrates good generalization across multiple models and datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an effective general framework for compressing volumetric radiance fields to very small sizes, enabling their practical use in real applications. The proposed techniques including pruning, vector quantization and joint finetuning are simple yet efficient for volumetric model compression.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on compressing volumetric radiance fields:

- Volumetric radiance fields methods like Plenoxels, DVGO, and TensoRF achieve fast training and rendering but require a lot of storage (100s of MB). This paper addresses the storage overhead issue, which limits real-world applicability.

- Most prior work on compressing neural radiance fields has focused on compressing vanilla NeRF models. This paper targets the volumetric variants, which have distinct grid-based structures.

- Techniques like weight pruning, quantization, and low-rank approximation have been applied before to compress radiance fields. This paper combines ideas like pruning and vector quantization in a novel framework tailored for volumetric models. 

- The proposed compression pipeline of voxel pruning, vector quantization, and post-processing achieves much higher compression ratios (~100x) than prior work while maintaining rendering quality. The 1 MB model size is unprecedented.

- The framework is general and achieves strong performance across different volumetric methods (DVGO, Plenoxels, TensoRF) and diverse datasets. This shows the wide applicability of the approach.

- The proposed techniques like the cumulative score metric for pruning and joint fine-tuning are simple but effective. The paper provides ablation studies to validate design choices.

- Compared to concurrent work like CCNeRF and Re:NeRF, this paper achieves better trade-offs between model size and rendering quality, likely due to the focus on volumetric architectures.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in compressing volumetric radiance fields by orders of magnitude compared to prior art, with innovations in the compression framework, training strategies, and extensive experiments validating the approach. The methods help enable the practical use of volumetric radiance fields.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

1. Improving compression efficiency: The authors mention trying more advanced entropy encoding methods like arithmetic coding to further improve compression efficiency. They also suggest exploring neural network-based approaches for more optimized codebook learning. 

2. Perceptual metrics: The authors note that MSE/PSNR may not perfectly correlate with perceptual quality for novel view synthesis. They suggest exploring perceptual metrics and losses like LPIPS to better optimize for visual quality.

3. Model distillation: The authors propose knowledge distillation as a way to train a small network to mimic a compressed volumetric radiance field. This could enable real-time rendering while maintaining quality.

4. Dynamic scenes: The current method focuses on static scenes. The authors suggest extending it to handle dynamic scenes with motion and temporal consistency. This could involve updating codebooks over time.

5. Generalization: While results are shown on multiple datasets, the authors note the method could be validated on more diverse scenes. Ensuring the framework generalizes broadly is an important direction. 

6. Unbounded scenes: Current volumetric methods like the one presented are limited to bounded/medium scenes. Scaling to large unbounded environments remains an open challenge.

In summary, the main future directions are improving compression efficiency, perceptual quality, model distillation, handling dynamics, generalization, and scalability to large scenes. Advancing in these areas could make volumetric radiance field compression even more practical and applicable.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes VQRF, a framework for compressing volumetric radiance fields like Plenoxels and DVGO to reduce their storage requirements while preserving rendering quality. The method has three main steps - voxel pruning, vector quantization, and post-processing. First, less important voxels are pruned based on an adaptive importance score threshold to remove redundancy. Next, vector quantization is used to encode the color features of remaining voxels into a compact codebook, so that multiple voxels can share the same code vector. This significantly reduces the number of bits needed per voxel. Finally, post-processing like weight quantization and entropy encoding further compresses the model. Experiments show VQRF can compress volumetric radiance fields by 100x down to 1MB with negligible loss of rendering quality. The framework is simple yet effective, and generalizes well across scenes, datasets and volumetric radiance field methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF) for compressing volumetric radiance field models such as Plenoxels and DVGO. These volumetric models provide fast training and rendering but require large storage, often hundreds of megabytes. The VQRF framework aims to significantly compress these models while retaining rendering quality. 

The framework has three main steps. First, an adaptive voxel pruning method removes unimportant voxels that contribute little to rendering quality, providing around 8x compression. Next, a vector quantization method further compresses the model by encoding voxel features into a compact shared codebook, achieving around 33x additional compression. Finally, a joint tuning process and postprocessing like weight quantization provide end-to-end compression rates around 100x. Experiments validate the framework generalizes across methods and datasets. For example, a 104MB DVGO model is compressed to 1.05MB with negligible quality loss. The work facilitates widespread use of volumetric radiance fields through highly compressed representations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a compression framework for volumetric radiance fields called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF). The framework has three main steps: voxel pruning, vector quantization, and post-processing. For voxel pruning, they compute an importance score for each voxel based on its contribution to rendering, then adaptively prune voxels below a threshold. For vector quantization, they learn a compact codebook and encode voxel features as indices into the codebook rather than storing features directly. This is optimized via a joint finetuning strategy. Finally, for post-processing they apply weight quantization and entropy encoding to further compress the model. Through this pipeline they are able to compress volumetric radiance field models by around 100x with minimal loss in rendering quality. The method is flexible and achieves strong performance across different volumetric radiance field architectures and datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of high storage costs associated with volumetric radiance field methods for novel view synthesis. These methods typically store features on voxel grids, which can result in models requiring hundreds of megabytes of storage. The goal is to compress these models to reduce storage overhead while maintaining high rendering quality.

The key questions/problems the paper is trying to address are:

- How can we effectively compress volumetric radiance field models to reduce storage costs?

- What techniques can reduce model size while minimizing loss in rendering quality?

- Can we develop a general compression framework that works across different volumetric radiance field methods and scenes?

- How much compression is possible for these models while still generating high quality novel views?

So in summary, the paper introduces a compression framework called VQRF to address the storage overhead of volumetric radiance fields and allow the use of these methods in more practical applications. The key contribution is developing techniques to compress these models by over 100x while maintaining competitive rendering results.
