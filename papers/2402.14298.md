# [Multi-modal Stance Detection: New Datasets and Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stance detection aims to identify people's opinions towards specific targets from social media. 
- Most prior work focuses on textual stance detection. However, social media posts are increasingly multi-modal (text + images). Detecting stances from such multi-modal content is an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents 5 new multi-modal Twitter datasets spanning different domains and containing text + image posts. Total size is 17,544 annotated examples.
- A Targeted Multi-modal Prompt Tuning (TMPT) framework is proposed. It employs target-specific textual and visual prompts to adapt pre-trained language and vision models. This helps capture better multi-modal stances.
- Textual prompt tuning freezes target-aware prompts for the language model. Visual prompt tuning inserts trainable prompt tokens to guide the vision model. 
- Simple vector concatenation fuses textual + visual representations.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of 5 new benchmark multi-modal stance detection datasets to facilitate progress.
- A simple yet effective TMPT framework that shows superior performance over strong baselines by properly utilizing targets to tune textual and visual models.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art results on in-target and zero-shot multi-modal stance detection.
- Analysis providing insights into multi-modal stances and the efficacy of targeted prompting.

In summary, the paper enables multi-modal stance detection by releasing new datasets and proposing an intuitive prompting based approach that gives significantly better performance compared to previous methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Targeted Multi-modal Prompt Tuning (TMPT) framework. Can you explain in detail how textual prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning work in this framework? What are the key ideas behind using prompt tuning for stance detection?

2. The paper introduces targeted textual and visual prompts in TMPT. Why is incorporating target information important in designing the prompts? How do the prompts help capture target-specific stance features?

3. The paper experiments with different design choices for textual prompts (e.g. frozen vs tuned, hand-crafted prompts). What impact do these choices have on performance? What worked best and why? 

4. For visual prompt tuning, the paper analyzes different factors like depth of tuning, number of tokens, and initialization. How do these factors influence the overall results? What settings worked optimally?

5. The paper proposes a simple concatenation based fusion technique. How effective is this compared to more complex fusion methods? Is there scope to explore attention based or graph based fusion within the TMPT framework?

6. How consistent are the improvements from TMPT across different datasets and domains? Where does it achieve maximum gains compared to baselines? What inferences can you draw about applicability?

7. The paper introduces new multi-modal stance detection datasets. What are some key statistics and analyses on these datasets? How do they advance research in this area?  

8. An ablation study in the paper analyzes the impact of removing textual or visual prompts. What specifically does this reveal about the contribution of each modality?

9. Are there any limitations of TMPT in terms of requiring manual design of prompts? How can this be addressed to make it more automated?

10. The paper also explores TMPT with chain of thought and different pre-trained models. How effective are these and what future work can be done to build on top of TMPT?
