# [Auditable Homomorphic-based Decentralized Collaborative AI with   Attribute-based Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing federated learning (FL) systems rely on a centralized server which poses risks like single point of failure and bottlenecks. 
- FL systems lack transparency as only the server tracks model updates from clients, reducing trust.
- Gradients leaked from clients may reveal private data. Existing solutions either inadequately protect privacy or significantly impact model accuracy.

Proposed Solution - AerisAI:
- Decentralized system using blockchain and smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Addresses single point failure.
- Transactions recorded on blockchain provide transparency and auditability. 
- Clients perturb gradients with noise for differential privacy and encrypt using homomorphic encryption before uploading to blockchain. Addresses privacy issues.
- Aggregated noise allows mitigating impact on model accuracy. Broadcasts noise efficiently using ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption.

Main Contributions:  
- First decentralized collaborative AI system combining gradient perturbation, masking and group key management for privacy protection with good model accuracy.
- Formal security analysis proving privacy.
- Functionality comparison with baselines showing AerisAI uniquely addresses all requirements.
- Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate AerisAI significantly outperforms baselines in accuracy and efficiency.

In summary, the paper proposes AerisAI, a novel blockchain-based decentralized and transparent federated learning framework with strong privacy protection and accuracy. Formal analysis and extensive evaluations demonstrate AerisAI's effectiveness over existing methods.
