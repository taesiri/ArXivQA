# [Global Vegetation Modeling with Pre-Trained Weather Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18438)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate vegetation models can provide insights into the complex interactions between vegetation activity and ecosystem processes. 
- Previous work has shown vegetation changes are affected by long-term climate change and short-term climate variability.
- Recent transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for weather forecasting, but their applicability to vegetation modeling is unexplored.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors adapt the pre-trained weather forecasting model FourCastNet (FCN) to model the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy for vegetation activity.  
- They replace the weather forecasting head of FCN with a new head to predict NDVI and finetune the model on daily weather data to capture short-term climate variability effects on vegetation.
- They compare finetuning FCN to training it from scratch, analyze model performance with varying training time and data, and compare to other global and local NDVI modeling approaches.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art weather transformers can be adapted to vegetation modeling with improved performance over training from scratch.
- Show strong global NDVI modeling performance at high spatial (0.25Â°) and temporal (daily) resolution using only meteorological data.
- Compare favorably to other global modeling approaches, with better spatial resolution than prior global ML approach, and match or exceed performance of statistical ecology models at local scales.  
- Provide analysis of model performance with varying finetuning time and data, suggesting more data could further improve global vegetation modeling.
- Establish baseline for using weather transformers to globally model the complex effects of climate variability on vegetation with a single model.

In summary, the paper shows promise for adapting pre-trained weather models to capture the complex spacetime dependencies relating climate variability and vegetation dynamics within a single globally applicable model. The proposed approach could be extended to incorporate additional relevant data variables in future work.
