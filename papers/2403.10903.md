# [DTOR: Decision Tree Outlier Regressor to explain anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Anomaly detection models are being widely used to identify fraudulent activities, risks, and threats in critical domains like banking. However, the lack of explainability around how these models make decisions on what is anomalous poses challenges for stakeholders to understand the root causes and take appropriate actions. 

- Existing explainability techniques like SHAP focus on feature importance scores but may not provide transparent and comprehensive explanations, especially for complex models and high-dimensional datasets. Rule-based techniques like Anchors generate human-interpretable rules explaining model predictions but have limitations when applied to anomaly detection in a regression setting.

- There is a need for an interpretable explainable AI (XAI) technique tailored for anomaly detection that can provide rule-based explanations elucidating why certain data points are deemed anomalies.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Decision Tree Outlier Regressor (DTOR) - a novel model-agnostic framework for generating rule-based explanations specifically suited for anomaly detection. 

- It works by training a decision tree regressor to estimate the anomaly scores from the detector model. The path traversed by a data point in the tree provides a set of predicates as the explanation rule. A weighted loss focuses training on accurately estimating the score for the point being explained.

- Compared to Anchors, DTOR is designed as a regressor rather than classifier. It has consistently 100% validity in the experiments and provides both score and predicates for enhanced transparency. The explanations align with isolation principles in techniques like Isolation Forests.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of DTOR - an XAI approach using decision tree regressor to generate interpretable rules explaining anomalies in an unsupervised manner.

- Novel weighted scheme for training tailored to prioritize explanation accuracy on the specific data point.  

- New methodology proposed to estimate rule precision that aims to preserve some correlations between variables, avoiding fully synthetic neighborhood generation.

- Experiments on multiple datasets and detectors demonstrate DTOR's effectiveness over Anchors in measures like validity, coverage and execution time.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing rule-based explainability for anomaly detection models to promote trust and transparency in critical applications like banking fraud analytics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Decision Tree Outlier Regressor (DTOR), a novel model-agnostic explainable AI technique for generating human-interpretable rule-based explanations that elucidate the reasons behind anomalous score predictions from unsupervised anomaly detection models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of a new model-agnostic explainable AI (XAI) method called Decision Tree Outlier Regressor (DTOR) for generating rule-based explanations of anomaly scores from unsupervised anomaly detection models. Specifically:

- DTOR trains a decision tree regressor to estimate the anomaly scores output by any anomaly detection model for individual data points. It assigns a higher weight to the data point being explained during training to prioritize fitting that point's score.

- Once trained, DTOR extracts the path in the decision tree followed by the data point to generate a rule explaining why it received its anomaly score. This rule comprises predicates on features that isolate the data point, similar to how isolation forests isolate anomalies.

- Compared to other rule-based XAI techniques like Anchors, DTOR is tailored for explaining anomaly scores rather than classifier predictions. The paper shows it has competitive precision and coverage, while being valid for 100% of test points across multiple datasets and anomaly detectors. 

- The paper also introduces a modified approach to estimate the precision of rules by partially preserving correlations between variables, moving towards a more "conditional" estimation.

In summary, the key contribution is DTOR as a novel, versatile and effective technique for generating interpretable rule-based explanations specialized for anomaly detection models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the DTOR method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that DTOR trains a decision tree regressor to learn the anomaly scores generated by an anomaly detection model. How does the weighted loss function used during training ensure that the decision tree focuses on accurately estimating the anomaly score for the data point being explained?

2. Algorithm 1 shows the overall approach for generating an explanation rule using DTOR. Walk through the key steps and explain how extracting the path followed by the data point in the fitted decision tree provides an interpretable rule. 

3. How does the proposed approach for computing precision (Algorithm 2) balance retaining some correlations between variables in the explaining rule and other variables, compared to Anchors' approach of breaking correlations? What is the rationale behind this?

4. The paper evaluates DTOR explanations using metrics like execution time, precision, coverage, validity and rule length. Explain these metrics in detail and discuss how they capture different aspects of the utility of explanation rules. 

5. Why does the paper argue that comparing two explainability techniques like Anchors and DTOR poses challenges? What considerations need to be made regarding hyperparameters and evaluation metrics?

6. Analyze and critique the experiments comparing Anchors and DTOR. What are some key observations regarding the performance of the two methods across different models and datasets?

7. The paper observes different behaviors of Anchors and DTOR explanations for anomalous versus normal data points. Provide possible reasons behind Anchors' greater tendency to explain anomalies.  

8. How does the ability of DTOR to provide an average anomaly score for a rule, in addition to precision, potentially enhance interpretability compared to other rule-based methods?

9. Discuss strengths and limitations of using decision tree regressors as the foundation for generating explanations of anomaly scores, compared to other surrogate model choices. 

10. The conclusion argues that DTOR is versatile, effective and comparable to Anchors for XAI in anomaly detection. Do you agree with this assessment based on the experimental results? Justify your viewpoint.
