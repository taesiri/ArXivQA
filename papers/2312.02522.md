# [MASP: Scalable GNN-based Planning for Multi-Agent Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02522)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a decentralized, goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning framework called Multi-Agent Scalable GNN-based Planner (MASP) for multi-agent navigation tasks. MASP adopts a two-level structure to reduce the complexity of the search space - the high-level Multi-Goal Matcher assigns goals to agents using graph matching, while the low-level Coordinated Action Executor leverages graph neural networks to model agent-agent and agent-goal interactions and take actions towards the assigned goals. To enhance generalization to varying team sizes, agents are divided into fixed-sized groups. Experiments in complex particle and 3D drone simulation environments with up to 50 agents demonstrate that MASP significantly outperforms prior planning and learning methods in terms of faster convergence, higher success rate, and better cooperation. The learned policies also exhibit zero-shot transfer to unseen team sizes. Key innovations include the goal-conditioned hierarchical structure, graph-based modeling of interactions, and fixed-sized agent grouping. By effectively tackling large search spaces, MASP provides an efficient and scalable solution for complex multi-agent navigation.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a decentralized, goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning framework called MASP that uses graph neural networks to effectively assign goals and coordinate actions for scalable multi-agent navigation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a decentralized, goal-conditioned hierarchical planner called MASP (Multi-Agent Scalable GNN-based Planner) to improve data efficiency and cooperation in navigation tasks with a large number of agents. Specifically, MASP has the following key features:

1) It adopts a hierarchical framework to divide the large search space into smaller spaces, reducing space complexity and accelerating training convergence. 

2) It utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the interaction between agents and goals, improving goal achievement and cooperation.

3) It divides agents into groups with a fixed number of agents during both training and evaluation to enhance generalization capabilities to scenarios with unseen team sizes.

4) Empirical results show that MASP outperforms other planning-based and RL baselines in complex environments with large and varying numbers of agents, achieving higher sample efficiency and better performance.

5) MASP exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen team sizes in the experiments.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the MASP framework to address the challenges of low sample efficiency and limited cooperation in multi-agent navigation tasks, especially with large numbers of agents. MASP demonstrates superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of decentralized multi-agent navigation where multiple agents need to reach initially unassigned targets within a time limit. Classical planning methods have limited coordination capabilities and reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with low sample efficiency and cooperation, especially with increasing numbers of agents or complex environments.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a goal-conditioned hierarchical framework called Multi-Agent Scalable GNN-based Planner (MASP) that improves sample efficiency and cooperation for navigation tasks with many agents. MASP has two key components:

1) Multi-Goal Matcher (MGM): Performs graph matching to assign the most suitable unexplored target goal to each agent at every global step. This reduces the action space complexity.

2) Coordinated Action Executor (CAE): Uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent-agent and agent-goal interactions to promote cooperation towards reaching assigned goals. A group mechanism helps generalize to varying team sizes.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a GNN-based hierarchical framework to divide the large search space into smaller manageable spaces for faster training convergence

- Introduces a goal assignment module based on graph matching for improved goal achievement  

- Employs GNNs to capture agent-agent and agent-goal correlations for enhanced cooperation

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex navigation tasks with up to 50 agents in Multi-Agent Particle Environments and 20 agents in 3D OmniDrones environment

- Demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen team sizes during evaluation

In summary, the paper presents a decentralized, scalable and sample-efficient planner using ideas from hierarchical RL and graph neural networks to tackle complex navigation challenges faced by prior multi-agent learning methods involving large numbers of agents.
