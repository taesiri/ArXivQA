## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a decentralized, goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning framework called Multi-Agent Scalable GNN-based Planner (MASP) for multi-agent navigation tasks. MASP adopts a two-level structure to reduce the complexity of the search space - the high-level Multi-Goal Matcher assigns goals to agents using graph matching, while the low-level Coordinated Action Executor leverages graph neural networks to model agent-agent and agent-goal interactions and take actions towards the assigned goals. To enhance generalization to varying team sizes, agents are divided into fixed-sized groups. Experiments in complex particle and 3D drone simulation environments with up to 50 agents demonstrate that MASP significantly outperforms prior planning and learning methods in terms of faster convergence, higher success rate, and better cooperation. The learned policies also exhibit zero-shot transfer to unseen team sizes. Key innovations include the goal-conditioned hierarchical structure, graph-based modeling of interactions, and fixed-sized agent grouping. By effectively tackling large search spaces, MASP provides an efficient and scalable solution for complex multi-agent navigation.
