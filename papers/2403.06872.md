# [Exploring Large Language Models and Hierarchical Frameworks for   Classification of Large Unstructured Legal Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Legal judgment prediction from long, unstructured case documents is challenging due to the lack of structure and lengthy texts (thousands of words).
- Existing methods don't work well on such lengthy, unstructured texts.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a multi-stage hierarchical framework called MESc (Multi-stage Encoder-based Supervised with-clustering) for judgment prediction. 
- MESc splits the document into chunks, extracts embeddings from last layers of a fine-tuned LLM encoder for each chunk.
- It applies unsupervised clustering on the chunk embeddings to approximate document structure. 
- The chunk embeddings and structure labels are then processed through transformer encoders to learn inter-chunk representations.
- Finally a classifier makes the judgment prediction based on chunk representations and structure labels.

Contributions:
- Test the proposed MESc framework with legal datasets ILDC and LexGLUE having long, unstructured texts.
- Explore adaptability of multi-billion parameter LLMs like GPT-Neo, GPT-J with MESc framework.
- Analyze last layer embedding combination, impact of approximated structure labels in MESc.  
- Study intra-domain transfer learning capability of GPT variants between different legal domains.
- Achieve new SOTA results on ILDC (+2%) and LexGLUE ECtHR/SCOTUS subsets (+2 points in micro F1 score).
- Show MESc is more reliable for long documents than standalone fine-tuned LLM, especially when important sections are unknown.

In summary, the paper explores judgment prediction for lengthy, unstructured legal texts by proposing a hierarchical framework MESc and shows performance gains over prior state-of-the-art by using clustering to approximate document structure.
