# [SmoothQuant+: Accurate and Efficient 4-bit Post-Training   WeightQuantization for LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities but their huge model size poses challenges for deployment due to high compute, memory, and latency requirements. 
- 4-bit post-training quantization methods for LLMs can reduce memory footprint by ~75% compared to FP16 models but come at the cost of accuracy loss. 
- Existing methods like GPTQ, AWQ, and OWQ still face significant accuracy drops or slow deployment.

Key Idea:
- The paper proposes that loss from weight quantization is amplified by activation outliers. By smoothing outliers in activations and adjusting weights accordingly, quantization loss can be reduced.

Proposed Solution - SmoothQuant+:
- Smoothes activations by channel before quantization while adjusting corresponding weights for mathematical equivalence. This makes model more quantization-friendly.
- Searches channel-wise smoothing factors quickly to minimize whole model's quantization loss.
- Performs group-wise 4-bit weight quantization of linear layers for reduced loss.
- Implements efficient 4-bit quantization in vLLM framework for easy and performant deployment.

Main Contributions:
- Enables lossless 4-bit weight-only quantization for Code Llama family of LLMs with SmoothQuant+, a first.
- Achieves 1.9-4x higher throughput and 32% lower latency compared to FP16 baseline for Code Llama-34B using single GPU with SmoothQuant+.
- Proposes a new perspective that activation outliers amplify quantization loss of weights. Smoothing activations before quantization is an effective solution.
- Provides smooth and efficient 4-bit quantization deployment through vLLM.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in accurate and performant 4-bit quantization for LLMs by smoothing activations. The insights and technical solution pave the way for easy deployment of LLMs using lower precision.
