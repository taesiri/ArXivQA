# [Detecting Grasping Sites in a Martian Lava Tube: Multi-Stage Perception   Trade Study for ReachBo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents a trade study to design and evaluate perception system architectures for ReachBot, a novel climbing robot concept that uses grippers on deployable booms to navigate rough terrain. 

The problem is that while previous ReachBot studies have discussed mechanical design and motion planning, analysis of the perception system remains lacking. Since ReachBot interacts with terrain over long distances, a robust perception strategy is crucial to identify grasping locations and enable autonomous operation. 

The paper first provides background on perception systems for microspine climbing robots and robots designed for subsurface exploration. It then discusses high-level perception strategies for ReachBot, like one-stage versus two-stage perception.

Next, the paper outlines the trade study process to narrow down architectural variables like the environment, robot configuration, and mass budget. For a case study mission in a Martian lava tube, sensor selection criteria are developed. Trades are conducted on sensing modalities and commercially available sensors. 

The key outcomes are:
- Recommendation of a two-stage perception system with LiDAR and radar for far-field sensing, and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera for near-field sensing. This allows sensing from the main body and distal boom tip.
- Identification of leading COTS components for prototyping the perception system.
- Analysis of different environment map representations for the planner.

In conclusion, the paper presents perception system strategies, hardware configurations, and sensor recommendations to enable autonomous operation of ReachBot in extreme environments. The final result enables progression towards a hardware prototype for testing.
