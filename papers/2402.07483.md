# [T-RAG: Lessons from the LLM Trenches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive language capabilities, fueling interest in using them for applications like question answering over private enterprise documents. However, deploying LLMs in such settings faces challenges like data security risks, limited computational resources, and the need for robust performance. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors present a case study of building an LLM-based question answering application over a private governance manual document from a large non-profit organization.
- They create an application called Tree-RAG (T-RAG) combining retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant context, with a finetuned open-source LLM for response generation.
- A key component is the inclusion of an entities tree representing the organization's hierarchy. This is used to generate textual descriptions about entities to augment the context for entity-related questions.

Main Contributions:
- Case study demonstrating considerations in building a real-world LLM application.
- Application combining RAG and finetuning an open-source LLM. 
- Novel tree-based context generation for questions about organizational entities.  
- New evaluation metric - Correct-Verbose - to assess verbose but correct responses.
- Evaluations showing T-RAG performs better than just RAG or finetuning.
- Sharing lessons based on experiences building the application.

In summary, the paper provides a practical case study for building an LLM question answering application tailored to a private enterprise document, using a combination of methods to create a robust system.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a case study of building an AI system for question answering over private enterprise documents, combining retrieval-augmented generation with a finetuned language model and a novel tree-based context representation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors present a real case study in creating an LLM powered application for question answering over private enterprise documents. 

2) They create an application that combines the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a finetuned open-source LLM for response generation, trained over an instruction dataset generated from the organization's document.

3) They include a novel tree-based context as a component in their system which they call Tree-RAG (T-RAG). It uses a tree structure to represent hierarchical information (i.e. entities in an organization) and is used to generate textual descriptions that augment the context when responding to queries about entities.

4) They present a new evaluation metric called Correct-Verbose for assessing generated responses - this captures responses that are correct but also provide additional correct information not relevant to the question.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a case study in building a real-world LLM application for question answering that combines RAG, finetuning and a novel tree-based context augmentation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What were the key considerations and challenges faced when deploying a question answering system over private enterprise documents? How did the authors address issues like data security and limited computational resources?

2. How exactly does Tree-RAG (T-RAG) augment retrieval with additional context from a tree structure representing organizational hierarchies? What information does it extract and how is it formatted and incorporated into the context?

3. What was the process followed to create the instruction dataset for finetuning the LLM? What were the different prompt variations tried and how was the quality of the dataset ensured? 

4. What parameter-efficient finetuning method was used to update the LLM? Why was this approach suitable given the computational constraints? How were hyperparameters like rank selected?

5. How specifically was the entities tree designed to encode relationships between organizational units? What kind of information did each node in the tree contain in order to trace hierarchical relationships?

6. How did the authors customize named entity recognition to only extract organization-specific entities from user queries? What rules were defined to enable adaptive context generation based on detected entities?

7. What were the different system implementations evaluated? Why evaluate both retrieval-augmented generation and finetuning separately before testing the full Tree-RAG system?

8. How exactly was the new Correct-Verbose evaluation metric defined and what additional insight did it provide about verbose responses compared to other implementations?

9. What tradeoffs were discussed between finetuning vs retrieval-based methods for question answering? How can hybrid approaches combine their complementary strengths?

10. What future work directions were identified to enhance organization-specific QA systems based on the lessons learned? How can the current approach be expanded to handle additional documents or chat-based applications?
