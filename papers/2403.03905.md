# [Black-Box $k$-to-$1$-PCA Reductions: Theory and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the problem of $k$-principal component analysis ($k$-PCA), which seeks to find the top-$k$ eigenvectors of a covariance matrix. This problem arises frequently in statistics and machine learning applications. A key challenge is that the covariance matrix is not explicitly available - it must be estimated from samples. This makes designing efficient and accurate algorithms for $k$-PCA challenging, especially when only black-box access to a $1$-PCA primitive is available.

Main Contributions: 
1. The paper provides a sharp analysis of a natural approach called "deflation" for reducing $k$-PCA to calling a $1$-PCA primitive $k$ times. This answers an open question on characterizing when black-box reductions are possible for $k$-PCA. 

2. For the quadratic-form based "energy PCA (ePCA)" approximation metric, the paper shows deflation incurs no loss in accuracy. This resolves the open question positively for ePCA.

3. For the popular subspace-correlation based "correlation PCA (cPCA)" metric, the paper fully characterizes the parameter regimes where black-box cPCA reductions are possible or fundamentally impossible. Outside prohibitively challenging regimes, a quasipolynomial $k^{\Theta(\log k)}$ blowup suffices.

4. As applications, the paper develops new robust $k$-PCA algorithms for both sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed distributions improving on prior work. A new online $k$-cPCA algorithm for heavy tails is also given.

In summary, the paper provides a sharp analysis of black-box reductions for $k$-PCA, resolving open questions in this space. The reduction frameworks are shown to enable development of better robust and streaming $k$-PCA methods in statistical settings under various structural assumptions. The techniques leverage linear algebraic methods and spectral perturbation arguments.
