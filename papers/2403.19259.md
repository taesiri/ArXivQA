# [J-CRe3: A Japanese Conversation Dataset for Real-world Reference   Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding referential expressions that link language to the physical world is important for human-assisting systems like robots that need to understand users' intentions and perform expected actions. 
- Existing works have limitations in handling real-world interactions - they lack real physical agent-object manipulations, omit referential phrases frequently (zero references), or only handle direct references.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a multimodal reference resolution task that involves grounding verbal information in user interactions to visual information in egocentric views.
- The task consists of 3 subtasks: textual reference resolution, object detection, and text-to-object reference resolution.
- To enable research on this task, the authors construct a multimodal conversational dataset called J-CRe3 with egocentric videos of real conversations between two people acting as a master and assistant robot.

Main Contributions:
- Definition of a multimodal reference resolution task crucial for human-robot interaction systems.
- J-CRe3 dataset containing rich annotations - object bounding boxes, various textual reference relations, text-to-object relations including indirect ones.
- Analysis of an experimental resolution model that combines state-of-the-art models for the 3 subtasks, showing reasonably good textual reference resolution performance but challenging text-to-object reference resolution.

In summary, the paper proposes the important but challenging multimodal reference resolution task and provides the J-CRe3 dataset to facilitate research on this task. The analysis reveals high-quality textual reference resolution is achievable but linking language to physical objects remains difficult.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multimodal reference resolution task for grounding referential expressions in real-world human-robot conversations to objects in egocentric video, and constructs a dataset of recorded conversations with textual and visual annotations to evaluate methods for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new multimodal reference resolution task and constructing a dataset called J-CRe3 (A Japanese Conversation dataset for Real-world Reference Resolution) to support research on this task. Specifically:

- They propose a multimodal reference resolution task that involves grounding referential expressions in conversational language to objects in egocentric video frames. This is intended to help develop human-assisting systems like robots that can understand instructions involving real-world objects.

- They constructed the J-CRe3 dataset containing egocentric videos and conversational audios between two people playing the roles of a master and an assistant robot. The videos and audios are annotated with various reference relations between textual phrases and object bounding boxes.

- The relations annotated include direct references as well as indirect ones like predicate-argument structures and bridging references. The dataset also handles zero references common in Japanese conversations where arguments are omitted.

- They implemented a baseline multimodal reference resolution model and conducted experiments on J-CRe3 to demonstrate the challenges of this new task. The textual reference resolution performed decently but the text-to-object reference resolution was more difficult.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the multimodal reference resolution task tailored to real-world human-robot interactions, along with the new J-CRe3 dataset to facilitate research in this direction.

The paper proposes a multimodal reference resolution task to enable robots to interact and collaborate with humans in the real world. The key idea is to ground referential expressions in language to real-world objects to generate appropriate actions. The paper constructs a multimodal dataset called J-CRe3 containing egocentric videos and dialogues for this task. It consists of subtasks like textual reference resolution, object detection, and text-to-object reference resolution. The dataset handles phenomena like zero references and bridging references frequently observed in Japanese conversations. The paper also provides an analysis of an experimental resolution model on this dataset to demonstrate the challenges.
