# [SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-Based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate   Time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers have become pivotal building blocks for many state-of-the-art models, but suffer from quadratic complexity for longer sequences and lack inductive bias. 
- Recent state space models (SSMs) like S4, Hippo, Hyena address these issues but face stability problems when scaled up and still show a performance gap compared to transformers.
- Mamba is the current SOTA SSM but also exhibits stability issues and performance gaps when scaled to large vision models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SiMBA, a simplified Mamba-based architecture using Mamba for sequence modeling and a new technique called EinFFT for channel modeling.

- EinFFT involves Fourier transforms to model eigenvalues as negative numbers, ensuring stability of the recurrent SSM dynamics. 

- SiMBA combines Mamba and EinFFT to get the benefits of efficiency, inductive bias from Mamba along with stability from EinFFT.

Main Contributions:

- A new channel modeling method called EinFFT using Fourier transforms and non-linearities to constrain eigenvalues for ensuring model stability.

- SiMBA architecture combining Mamba and EinFFT, evaluated extensively across vision and time series tasks.

- SiMBA establishes new SOTA results among SSMs on ImageNet, transfer learning datasets and time series forecasting benchmarks.

- First SSM architecture to close the performance gap with transformer models on ImageNet while being efficient.

- Ablation studies validate the significance of different components of SiMBA - Mamba, EinFFT and residual connections.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions through the EinFFT technique and SiMBA architecture advancing state-of-the-art in sequence modeling for both computer vision and time series applications.
