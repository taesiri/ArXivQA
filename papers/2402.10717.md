# [BioFusionNet: Deep Learning-Based Survival Risk Stratification in ER+   Breast Cancer Through Multifeature and Multimodal Data Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10717)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Breast cancer poses a major health burden, especially estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cancer which requires careful risk stratification to guide treatment decisions. However, traditional clinicopathological models fail to fully capture the complex heterogeneity of breast cancer biology needed for accurate risk prediction.  

- There is a lack of models that integrate different data modalities like imaging, genomics and clinical data to enable robust survival risk assessment in ER+ breast cancer.

Solution - BioFusionNet Model:
- Proposes BioFusionNet, an end-to-end deep learning model for survival risk prediction in ER+ breast cancer by fusing histopathology imaging, genetic and clinical data.

- Employs self-supervised models (DINO, MoCoV3) pretrained on diverse histology image datasets to extract phenotypic image features. Fuses features using a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE).   

- Integrates image embeddings with genetics through a co-dual-cross attention mechanism to capture interplay between modalities. Further combines with clinical data using a feedforward network.

- Introduces a weighted Cox loss function tailored for imbalanced survival data.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a C-index of 0.77 and AUC of 0.84 for risk prediction.

- Predicts high vs low risk groups with significant correlation to overall survival in both univariate (HR=2.99) and multivariate analysis (HR=2.91).

- Provides interpretability of predictions through visualization of high attention regions and SHAP analysis of influential genes/clinical factors.

- Establishes an effective data fusion approach to leverage complementary multimodal data for enhanced risk assessment to guide clinical decision making in ER+ breast cancer.
