# [Injecting Wiktionary to improve token-level contextual representations   using contrastive learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pretrained language models (PLMs) provide contextual token embeddings that are too specific to each occurrence, making tokens from same word sense too distant in the vector space. This is problematic for lexical semantics tasks. 
- Prior work has used self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) to bring closer embeddings of augmented examples, but no work has investigated using lexicons to supervise the CL.

Proposed Solution:
- Fine-tune a PLM (BERT) using supervised CL, with examples from the English Wiktionary as training data. Each example sentence illustrates a word sense and contains the target word.
- Adapt the loss function to handle multiple positive examples per class, using the other examples of the same word sense as positives.
- Additionally test dimensionality reduction of embeddings before CL, using PCA with whitening.

Main Contributions:
- Show CL fine-tuning improves results on Word-in-Context (WiC) task, establishing new state-of-the-art on WiC test set. Gains generalize over test sets of different sense inventories.
- Outperform prior work using self-supervised CL, showing value of lexicon supervision.
- Observe modest improvements on frame induction task.
- Approach can be extended to many languages having large Wiktionaries.
- Analyze impact of dimensionality reduction which further improves WiC accuracy.

In summary, the paper presents a novel method to inject lexicon information into contextual token embeddings using CL, demonstrating its benefits for lexical semantics. The approach leverages supervision from Wiktionary to outperform prior self-supervised methods.
