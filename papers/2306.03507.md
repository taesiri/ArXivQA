# ["A Little is Enough": Few-Shot Quality Estimation based Corpus Filtering   improves Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural machine translation (NMT) models require large amounts of parallel text data for training, which is not available for many low-resource language pairs. 
- Web-crawled "pseudo-parallel" corpora can be noisy and degrade NMT performance if used directly.
- The task of parallel corpus filtering aims to extract high-quality parallel sentences from noisy pseudo-parallel corpora.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose using quality estimation (QE) models to assign quality scores to sentence pairs in pseudo-parallel corpora. 
- Extract sentence pairs above a quality threshold to create filtered parallel corpora.
- Train NMT models on filtered corpora concatenated with clean parallel data.

Main Contributions:
- Novel adaptation of QE framework to extract parallel sentences from pseudo-parallel corpora rather than evaluate existing translations.  
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art results by training English↔Marathi, Chinese→English and Hindi↔Bengali NMT models on QE-filtered corpora, improving over baseline by up to 1.8 BLEU.
- Show promise of transfer learning for low-resource QE: Hindi-Bengali QE model trained on just 500 sentences annotated for QE, transferred from English-Marathi, improves NMT by 0.6 BLEU.
- Compare against other filtering methods and show superiority of QE-based filtering. 
- Release all corpora and models publicly to support further research.

The paper makes both practical and theoretical contributions in using quality estimation for filtered corpora to improve low-resource neural machine translation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a quality estimation-based filtering approach to extract high-quality parallel sentences from noisy pseudo-parallel corpora which improves neural machine translation performance, and shows the promise of transfer learning for low-resource quality estimation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Adaptation of the Quality Estimation (QE) framework, normally used for MT evaluation, to extract high-quality parallel corpus from pseudo-parallel corpus. This is a novel use of QE for parallel corpus filtering. 

2. Demonstrating the promise of Few-Shot QE technique to generate training data for MT. A Hindi-Bengali QE model trained with only 500 instances transfer learned from an English-Marathi model achieves comparable performance to models trained on much more data.

3. Demonstrating performance improvement of up to 1.8 BLEU points for English-Marathi, Hindi-Bengali and Chinese-English machine translation systems compared to a baseline trained on the full pseudo-parallel corpus, by using the proposed QE-based corpus filtering approach.

So in summary, the main contribution is the adaptation of the QE framework for parallel corpus filtering and demonstrating its effectiveness, including in a low-resource few-shot transfer learning setting.

The paper proposes using Quality Estimation models to filter pseudo-parallel corpora and extract high-quality parallel sentences. It shows improvements in MT performance by using the filtered corpora, including in a low-resource Hindi-Bengali setting using only 500 training sentences. Key methods explored are LaBSE-based filtering, Phrase Pair Injection, and Quality Estimation scoring. Overall, the paper demonstrates an effective application of transfer learning and data filtering techniques to improve machine translation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using Quality Estimation (QE) for parallel corpus filtering. How is this an novel adaptation compared to typical uses of QE? What motivated this adaptation?

2. The paper demonstrates few-shot QE by fine-tuning an English-Marathi QE model with only 500 Hindi-Bengali sentence pairs. How does this compare to typical data requirements for training QE models? Why is transfer learning effective here?  

3. The paper shows higher Pearson correlation between QE scores and human judgments compared to LaBSE scores. What properties of QE make it more aligned with human assessments of quality?

4. For the Hindi-Bengali few-shot QE, what was the annotation process? How were the annotators selected and instructed? What measures were taken to ensure annotation quality?

5. The QE filtering method outperforms LaBSE filtering on the English-Marathi and Chinese-English test sets. What are some possible reasons? Could the higher amount of training data used by LaBSE have influenced results?

6. What are the limitations of using cosine similarity between embeddings for corpus filtering? How does a learned QE model overcome some of these limitations?

7. The paper uses XLM-R for QE modeling. How does pretraining on large multilingual data benefit QE transfer learning? Would other multilingual PLMs also be suitable?

8. What types of noise and errors could be present in the web-crawled pseudo-parallel corpora used? Would all these be captured by QE modeling? 

9. For production MT systems, what are the tradeoffs between using more filtered data vs less filtered but more training data overall?

10. The QE corpus filtering relies on score thresholds as hyperparameters. How were these set and what is their impact? Could more principled threshold selection further improve results?
