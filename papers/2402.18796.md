# [MOSAIC: A Modular System for Assistive and Interactive Cooking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to develop a modular system called MOSAIC that enables home robots to perform complex collaborative tasks like cooking with everyday users in a natural manner. The key challenges are: 1) enabling interactive and natural language communication between robots and humans, 2) developing a range of robot skills to manipulate everyday objects, and 3) enabling seamless human-robot collaboration through tasks like handing over items, avoiding collisions etc. Prior systems tend to focus on either predefined narrow tasks lacking human collaboration or scripted interactions lacking a range of skills.

Proposed Solution: 
The core insight is to take a modular approach - leverage large pre-trained models for general tasks like language and vision, while using specialized modules for task-specific controls like planning and manipulation. This allows combining the generalization of large models with the precision of specialized modules. 

MOSAIC has 3 key components:
1) Interactive Task Planner: Embeds large language models (LLMs) within a behavior tree framework to interact with users via natural language to select recipes and allocate subtasks between agents. Handles long term planning.
2) Visuomotor Skills: Leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to perceive objects and environments. Learns manipulation skills like picking via reinforcement learning in simulation to ensure precision without needing extensive real world demonstrations.  
3) Human Motion Forecasting: Predicts human pose and motion using models trained on large human activity datasets. Allows robots to plan safe motions during human-robot collaboration.

Together these components allow for natural communication, a range of skills over everyday objects, and seamless collaboration.

Main Contributions:
1) Interactive task planning system that robustly handles complex user interactions over long horizons by structuring LLM reasoning 
2) Lightweight visuomotor skill architecture that achieves generalization without needing online demonstrations 
3) Human motion forecasting approach tailored for robot collaboration by focusing predictions to maximize planning performance
4) Extensive real-world evaluations including 60 cooking trials across 6 recipes and over 300 trials evaluating individual modules

The system completes 68.3% of the collaborative cooking trials over different recipes with an average subtask completion rate of 91.6%. The modular architecture also allows diagnosing failures - over 85% of failures are attributable to specific modules.
