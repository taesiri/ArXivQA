# [MOSAIC: A Modular System for Assistive and Interactive Cooking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to develop a modular system called MOSAIC that enables home robots to perform complex collaborative tasks like cooking with everyday users in a natural manner. The key challenges are: 1) enabling interactive and natural language communication between robots and humans, 2) developing a range of robot skills to manipulate everyday objects, and 3) enabling seamless human-robot collaboration through tasks like handing over items, avoiding collisions etc. Prior systems tend to focus on either predefined narrow tasks lacking human collaboration or scripted interactions lacking a range of skills.

Proposed Solution: 
The core insight is to take a modular approach - leverage large pre-trained models for general tasks like language and vision, while using specialized modules for task-specific controls like planning and manipulation. This allows combining the generalization of large models with the precision of specialized modules. 

MOSAIC has 3 key components:
1) Interactive Task Planner: Embeds large language models (LLMs) within a behavior tree framework to interact with users via natural language to select recipes and allocate subtasks between agents. Handles long term planning.
2) Visuomotor Skills: Leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to perceive objects and environments. Learns manipulation skills like picking via reinforcement learning in simulation to ensure precision without needing extensive real world demonstrations.  
3) Human Motion Forecasting: Predicts human pose and motion using models trained on large human activity datasets. Allows robots to plan safe motions during human-robot collaboration.

Together these components allow for natural communication, a range of skills over everyday objects, and seamless collaboration.

Main Contributions:
1) Interactive task planning system that robustly handles complex user interactions over long horizons by structuring LLM reasoning 
2) Lightweight visuomotor skill architecture that achieves generalization without needing online demonstrations 
3) Human motion forecasting approach tailored for robot collaboration by focusing predictions to maximize planning performance
4) Extensive real-world evaluations including 60 cooking trials across 6 recipes and over 300 trials evaluating individual modules

The system completes 68.3% of the collaborative cooking trials over different recipes with an average subtask completion rate of 91.6%. The modular architecture also allows diagnosing failures - over 85% of failures are attributable to specific modules.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents MOSAIC, a modular robot system architecture integrating multiple large-scale pre-trained models that enables fluid human-robot collaboration for complex tasks like cooking through capabilities for interactive task planning via natural language, generalizable visuomotor skills, and human motion forecasting for safe coordination.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. An interactive task planner that embeds large language models within a behavior tree to interact with users via natural language, plan diverse tasks, and coordinate subtasks. This allows it to respect constraints and be more reliable compared to directly using an LLM.

2. A lightweight visuomotor skill architecture that leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for object identification and a policy learned via RL in simulation for action selection. This avoids needing online demonstrations while generalizing to new objects. 

3. A human motion forecasting method that leverages large-scale human motion data and interaction data to predict human intents. This allows the robot to plan safe actions when collaborating closely with humans.

4. Comprehensive experiments, including 60 end-to-end trials of two robots collaborating with a real human to cook 6 recipes. Additional experiments evaluate the individual modules more extensively.

5. Demonstrating the first home robot system capable of tightly collaborating with human users over long-horizon tasks by integrating multiple large-scale pre-trained models in a modular fashion.

The key insight is using modularity and pre-trained models to enable efficient learning and tighter human-robot collaboration. The main contribution is a complete system for assistive cooking that coordinates multiple skills, forecasts human intents, and interacts via natural language.
