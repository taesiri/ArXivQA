# [AV2AV: Direct Audio-Visual Speech to Audio-Visual Speech Translation   with Unified Audio-Visual Speech Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02512)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel direct Audio-Visual Speech to Audio-Visual Speech Translation (AV2AV) framework that can translate spoken language between languages while maintaining both the audio and visual speech streams. To address the lack of parallel training data between audio-visual speech, they leverage the modality-agnostic capabilities of a multilingually trained AV-HuBERT model to obtain unified audio-visual speech representations from audio-only data. These discrete representations termed "AV speech units" encapsulate linguistic content and can be treated as pseudo-text to train the translation model on audio-to-audio datasets. To generate synchronized raw audio and video outputs, they introduce an AV-Renderer with zero-shot speaker modeling to preserve speaker identity before and after translation. Experiments demonstrate comparable performance to cascaded systems and robustness to acoustic noise corruption. The proposed unified modeling approach allows a single AV2AV model to perform translation accepting either audio, visual or audio-visual inputs. Overall, this direct speech translation framework with multimodal input and outputs enhances realism and robustness while reducing complexity compared to cascaded systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a direct audio-visual speech to audio-visual speech translation framework that can translate between languages in both the audio and visual modalities using unified audio-visual speech representations, improving robustness and seamlessness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing the first direct Audio-Visual Speech to Audio-Visual Speech Translation (AV2AV) framework, whose inputs and outputs are both audio-visual speech.

2) Mitigating the absence of translation data between AV speech by employing the modality-agnostic characteristics of AV-HuBERT. The model can be trained on audio-only A2A dataset and applied to diverse tasks like A2AV, V2AV, and AV2AV. 

3) Designing a zero-shot AV-Renderer to maintain the speaker characteristics from source to translated AV speech, ensuring a seamless communication experience. 

4) Exploring the AV2AV in a many-to-many language translation setting, so one model can perform X-to-X translations where X is multilingual, while previous models were limited to one translation direction.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first direct AV2AV translation framework that can translate between multilingual audio-visual speech using a single model, while maintaining speaker identity before and after translation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Audio-Visual Speech to Audio-Visual Speech Translation (AV2AV): The main framework proposed in the paper for directly translating between multimodal (audio and visual) speech inputs and outputs.

- Unified Audio-Visual Speech Representations: Using the pre-trained AV-HuBERT model to extract unified representations from audio-visual speech, which allows the system to be trained on audio-only data but operate on multimodal inputs.

- AV Speech Units: The discretized and quantized speech features from AV-HuBERT that capture linguistic content and can be treated as pseudo-text for training the translation model.  

- Multilingual: The paper explores AV2AV translation in a many-to-many multilingual setting, with experiments on translation between English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese.

- Zero-shot AV Renderer: Novel component proposed to synthesize raw audio and video while preserving speaker identity before and after translation.

- Robustness: Showcases improved robustness to acoustic noise by leveraging complementary visual information along with audio input.

Some other notable concepts are direct speech translation, modality-agnostic representations, and the lack of parallel AV2AV datasets which is addressed by the proposed methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learning unified audio-visual speech representations from an A2A dataset using mAV-HuBERT. What is the rationale behind using the A2A dataset instead of requiring an AV2AV dataset? How does mAV-HuBERT enable training on A2A data?

2. The paper claims the proposed method can improve robustness to acoustic noise by using multimodal AV inputs. What is the explanation for why AV inputs improve robustness over audio-only inputs? How is this claim validated in the experiments? 

3. The zero-shot AV-Renderer is a key contribution for maintaining speaker identity before and after translation. Explain the zero-shot aspect and how speaker identity is preserved in both the vocoder and face renderer parts. 

4. Many-to-many multilingual translation is explored in this work. Explain what capabilities the many-to-many setting provides over a single direction translation system. How does the architecture support translations between multiple language pairs?

5. The proposed method does not require an intermediate text representation, making it textless. What are the benefits of avoiding text representations for translation? What challenges arise from not having text supervision?

6. The AV speech units are treated as a pseudo text representation for training the translation model. Explain the process of extracting AV speech units using mAV-HuBERT and how clustering enables a discrete representation. 

7. Compare and contrast the direct modeling approach of the proposed AV2AV system versus the cascaded ASR+NMT+TTS+TFG pipeline. What are the tradeoffs between the two types of systems?

8. The experiments compare against several baseline systems, including other cascaded systems and the recent AV-TranSpeech method. Analyze the results - in what scenarios does the proposed method excel and when does it fall short?

9. The paper explores translating between multiple input and output modalities, including A2AV, V2AV, and AV2AV. Explain how a single model can support diverse input/output combinations. What are the limitations?

10. The proposed AV2AV approach is end-to-end without intermediate representations. What future work could be explored to incorporate benefits from cascaded systems while retaining the advantages of direct translation?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a novel Audio-Visual Speech to Audio-Visual Speech Translation (AV2AV) framework that directly translates between input and output audio-visual speech.

- Employs a multilingual trained AV-HuBERT model (mAV-HuBERT) to obtain unified audio-visual speech representations from audio, visual or audio-visual inputs. Discretizes representations into audio-visual speech units.

- Trains the translation model on audio-only A2A datasets using the unified representations. This allows training with abundant A2A data and inference with diverse input modalities.

- Introduces an AV-Renderer with zero-shot speaker modeling to generate raw audio speech and talking face video from translated audio-visual speech units, preserving speaker identity.

Main Contributions:
- First work on direct AV2AV translation with audio-visual input and outputs for seamless dialogue experience.
