# [INSIGHT: End-to-End Neuro-Symbolic Visual Reinforcement Learning with   Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models lack transparency and interpretability, limiting their use in sensitive applications. 
- Existing neuro-symbolic RL (NS-RL) methods have issues with efficiency, accessibility, and performance:
    - They rely on fixed structured state representations that cannot be refined with rewards.
    - Symbolic policies require extensive domain knowledge to interpret. 
    - They underperform deep RL models.

Proposed Solution - INSIGHT Framework:

1. Visual Perception Module:
    - Uses a distilled vision model to efficiently map pixels to object coordinates (structured states).
    - Learns to predict object coordinates, existence and shape from image-coordinate dataset.
    - Coordinates are refined using both visual and reward signals during policy learning.

2. Policy Learning Module: 
    - Learns symbolic policies (using EQL network) over object coordinates.
    - Addresses limited expressiveness of coordinates using a neural policy to guide exploration. 
    - Simultaneously trains neural and symbolic (EQL) policies using policy distillation.

3. Policy Explanation Module:
    - Generates natural language explanations of policies and decisions using large language models.
    - Performs concept grounding to map task and policy concepts to variables.
    - Explains general policy patterns and specific decisions using policy equations, coordinate values and gradients.

Key Contributions:

- First framework to refine structured states for NS-RL using both visual and reward signals.
- Enhances accessibility via natural language explanations of symbolic policies.  
- Demonstrates superior performance over NS-RL methods on 9 Atari games.
- Showcases policy interpretations and decision explanations for Pong game.

The summary covers the key points about the problem being addressed, the proposed INSIGHT framework and its three components, the concept of using large language models for explanations, and the main contributions made in the paper regarding efficiency, accessibility and performance of neuro-symbolic RL.
