# [ECRF: Entropy-Constrained Neural Radiance Fields Compression with   Frequency Domain Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14208)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Entropy-Constrained Radiance Fields (ECRF) to compress neural radiance fields in an efficient way. ECRF directly minimizes the entropy of the radiance field representation in the frequency domain using a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). An entropy estimation network is used to optimize the DCT coefficients during training to achieve high sparsity for compression. This optimization happens jointly with the radiance field reconstruction objective. After training, a compression pipeline with quantization and entropy coding is applied to the DCT coefficients, significantly reducing model size without compromising visual quality. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance compared to previous approaches. ECRF achieves over 70x compression on multiple scenes while maintaining high novel view synthesis fidelity. The method provides an effective way to compress neural radiance/volumetric fields for practical usage with minimal overhead.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an entropy-constrained radiance field compression method that optimizes a frequency domain representation to achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for novel view synthesis under 1MB.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel entropy-aware training scheme to optimize the compressed size by minimizing log-likelihood of the bitstream using an entropy estimation network.

2. Introducing frequency-domain entropy parameterization by transforming the feature grid into the frequency domain using block-wise DCT and regularizing the coefficients to achieve sparsity. 

3. Achieving state-of-the-art compression performance in novel view synthesis under 1 MB by combining the proposed techniques with a compression pipeline including weight quantization and entropy coding of the transformed coefficients.

In summary, the key innovation is the frequency-domain entropy parameterization to minimize the entropy and size of the compressed radiance field representation, enabling efficient novel view synthesis with compact models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Entropy-constrained radiance fields (ECRF): The proposed compression model for efficiently storing radiance fields. It minimizes entropy in the frequency domain to achieve compact representations.

- Frequency-domain entropy parameterization: Transforming the feature grid into the frequency domain using DCT and optimizing for sparsity by minimizing entropy of the coefficients. This leads to efficiency gains.

- Discrete cosine transform (DCT): A Fourier-related transform commonly used in image/video compression. Applied in a block-wise manner to the feature grid. Compacts information into fewer coefficients.

- Entropy estimation network: Small MLPs used to model the probability distribution and estimate entropy during training. Discarded after training.

- Coefficient regularization: Regularization applied to the DCT coefficients that encourages sparsity. Improves compression performance. 

- Compression pipeline: Includes 8-bit quantization of coefficients and entropy coding using an arithmetic coder. Reduces storage requirements significantly.

- Rate-distortion performance: Compression efficiency measurement that trades off bit rate savings vs distortion/quality loss. The model optimizes this trade-off.

So in summary, the key ideas are using frequency domain techniques like DCT for sparsity and entropy optimization for compression of radiance fields. The pipeline to encode the compact representations is also a key aspect.
