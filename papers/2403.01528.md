## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Leveraging Biomolecule and Natural Language through Multi-Modal Learning: A Survey":

Problem:
Traditional biomolecular representations like sequences, graphs, and 3D structures capture intrinsic features but overlook rich external knowledge sources like biomedical literature and databases. These textual sources provide descriptive details about biomolecular properties, functions and interactions. Integrating external linguistic knowledge with biomolecular data can enable more comprehensive modeling. However, current techniques have limited ability to systematically leverage language data for enhanced biomolecular understanding.

Solution: 
This paper provides an extensive survey of recent advancements in cross Biomolecule-Language (BL) modeling, which aims to bridge modalities by jointly modeling biomolecules and natural language.

Key aspects covered:

1) Biomolecular representations: Summarizes common representations like 1D sequences, 2D graphs and 3D structures and associated deep learning techniques.

2) Rationale and objectives: Analyzes relationships between modalities and motivates their integration from representation and machine learning perspectives. Outlines goals like representation learning, instruction following and agent-based modeling.  

3) Learning frameworks: Discusses prominent frameworks like GPT-based pre-training, multi-stream neural networks and PaLM-E-style models with external encoders and modality projectors.

4) Representation learning: Examines training tasks like masked language modeling and next token prediction. Details strategies like multi-stage training, multi-task learning and few-shot testing.

5) Applications: Surveys areas benefited like predictive modeling, generative modeling and information retrieval.

6) Resources: Compiles datasets, models and benchmark results to facilitate research.

7) Challenges and opportunities: Identifies issues around data scarcity, model interpretability and biological task generalization. Outlines promising research directions.

Main Contributions:

- First comprehensive review of joint modeling of biomolecules and natural language
- Structured analysis of techniques, applications and resources to equip interdisciplinary researchers
- Identification of open challenges and future outlook to guide advancements in this rapidly evolving field

The paper serves as a holistic reference for the scientific community, consolidating insights from existing works and catalyzing new investigations in biomolecular characterization through multi-modal integration of structural and linguistic knowledge.
