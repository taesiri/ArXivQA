# [Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13379)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we design a prompting framework that provides both high accuracy and faithfulness/interpretability for large language models on complex reasoning tasks?

The key points are:

- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to boost language models' performance on complex reasoning tasks recently. 

- However, existing CoT methods lack faithfulness - the reasoning chain generated does not necessarily reflect how the model actually derives the final answer.

- The authors propose a new prompting framework, Faithful CoT, that decomposes reasoning into two stages: Translation and Problem Solving. 

- In Translation, a language model converts the query into a symbolic reasoning chain interleaving natural language and a symbolic language. 

- In Problem Solving, the reasoning chain is executed by a deterministic solver to derive the final answer.

- This approach provides faithfulness by construction, as the answer is the result of executing the reasoning chain.

- Experiments show Faithful CoT outperforms CoT prompting on most datasets, while also providing interpretability into the model's reasoning process.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by decomposing reasoning into translation and problem solving stages, they can create a prompting framework that achieves both high accuracy and faithfulness for language models on complex reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Faithful Chain-of-Thought (Faithful CoT), a novel prompting framework that provides interpretable and faithful reasoning for language models on complex tasks. Specifically:

- It proposes a 2-stage pipeline consisting of Translation and Problem Solving. In Translation, a language model converts a natural language query into a reasoning chain interleaving natural language and symbolic language (e.g. Python code). In Problem Solving, the reasoning chain is executed by a deterministic solver to derive the final answer.

- This approach decomposes reasoning into natural language understanding and formal logic execution. By using a solver to deterministically derive the answer, the reasoning chain provides a faithful explanation of how the model arrives at the answer. 

- The authors demonstrate the efficacy of Faithful CoT on diverse reasoning tasks spanning math word problems, multi-hop QA, planning, and logical inference. It outperforms standard prompting and previous CoT methods on most datasets, while also being interpretable and faithful.

- The reasoning chain provides opportunities for interaction, allowing users to understand and potentially fix errors by modifying the natural language components. 

In summary, the key innovation is proposing a prompting framework that makes language models more accurate, interpretable and faithful on complex reasoning tasks, by integrating natural language prompting with symbolic program execution.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this ICML 2023 paper submission compares to other related work:

- The paper proposes a new method called Faithful Chain-of-Thought (Faithful CoT) which aims to make chain-of-thought reasoning more interpretable and faithful. This builds directly on prior work on chain-of-thought prompting like Wei et al. 2022, but tries to address the limitation that the reasoning chains generated by those methods are not necessarily faithful explanations of the model's predictions. 

- The idea of decomposing reasoning into two stages - translation to generate a symbolic program, and then execution of that program - shares similarities with some other concurrent work like Chen et al. 2022 and Gao et al. 2022. However, a key difference emphasized is that this paper demonstrates the approach across multiple domains and symbolic languages, beyond just Python programs for arithmetic reasoning.

- The paper innovatively recasts planning, multi-hop QA, and logical inference tasks into a symbolic representation amenable to the two-stage approach. This is novel compared to prior work that has focused narrowly on math word problems.

- The design of interleaving natural language and symbolic language in the reasoning chain seems unique to this work, compared to prior CoT methods that generate chains purely in natural language. This is claimed to provide better interpretability.

- The paper provides a more comprehensive evaluation on reasoning tasks from diverse domains compared to related methods. The gains over chain-of-thought baselines demonstrated across planning, QA, math, and inference datasets are fairly convincing.

- The analyses investigating faithfulness vs performance tradeoffs, effect of constraints, error analysis etc. provide useful insights compared to prior CoT papers which do not study faithfulness.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress in addressing the faithfulness limitation of prior CoT work through a generalizable approach, while delivering solid empirical gains over strong baselines. The analyses also help understand the strengths and weaknesses compared to related methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving the faithfulness of the Translation stage, i.e. making the natural language to symbolic language translation more transparent and interpretable. The authors state that currently the Translation stage is still opaque.

- Performing human evaluations to assess the correctness and understandability of the generated reasoning chains. This could reveal strengths and weaknesses of the approach from a human perspective.

- Exploring interactive debugging of the model through the natural language interface provided by the reasoning chain prompt. The authors suggest the natural language comments could allow non-expert users to fix errors by modifying the chain.

- Applying the approach to additional tasks and domains beyond the ones explored in the paper. The authors demonstrate the framework on math, QA, planning and logical reasoning tasks, but suggest it could generalize more broadly.

- Comparing empirically to other concurrent work on generating reasoning chains as executable programs, which the authors were not able to include in this paper. 

- Investigating the effect of enforcing different constraints on the reasoning chain generation, to better understand the tradeoffs between accuracy and satisfying constraints.

- Exploring different choices of underlying language models and solvers to identify the most suitable components.

So in summary, the main directions are: improving faithfulness, human evaluation, interactive debugging, generalization, comparisons to related concurrent work, constraints, and model choices. The authors propose their approach as a general framework amenable to further research and application.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Faithful Chain-of-Thought (Faithful CoT), a new method for making large language models more interpretable and accurate on complex reasoning tasks. Faithful CoT breaks down reasoning into two stages - Translation and Problem Solving. In Translation, a language model converts a natural language query into a symbolic reasoning chain consisting of natural language comments interleaved with a symbolic language like Python or PDDL. In Problem Solving, this reasoning chain is executed by a deterministic solver like a Python interpreter to get the final answer. This makes the method interpretable since the reasoning chain provides insight into the model's reasoning process. The paper demonstrates Faithful CoT on 10 reasoning datasets across 4 domains - math, planning, QA, and logic. It outperforms standard prompting and vanilla CoT prompting, showing that enforcing faithfulness improves accuracy. The reasoning chain also enables users to understand errors and interactively debug the model. Overall, the paper shows that Faithfulness and accuracy can positively reinforce each other in language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Faithful Chain-of-Thought (Faithful CoT), a new method for improving the interpretability and performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks. The key idea is to decompose reasoning into two stages - Translation and Problem Solving. In the Translation stage, a language model converts a natural language query into a symbolic reasoning chain that interleaves natural language comments and executable code in a domain-specific symbolic language like Python or PDDL. In the Problem Solving stage, the symbolic reasoning chain is executed by a deterministic solver like a Python interpreter to derive the final answer. By construction, this guarantees that the generated reasoning chain faithfully explains how the model arrives at the answer. 

The authors demonstrate Faithful CoT on 10 reasoning datasets across 4 domains - math word problems, multi-hop QA, planning, and logical inference. Compared to standard prompting and vanilla Chain-of-Thought prompting, Faithful CoT improves accuracy on most datasets, with especially large gains in planning and logical inference. Using self-consistency decoding, it achieves new state-of-the-art few-shot performance on 7 out of 10 datasets. This shows Faithful CoT's strengths in providing interpretable, faithful and accurate reasoning chains. The analysis also reveals its robustness to exemplar choice and its ability to leverage the complementary strengths of the language model and the external solver.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are addressing is the lack of faithfulness (also called reliability or fidelity) in existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning methods for language models. 

Specifically, prior CoT prompting methods like Wei et al. 2022 generate a reasoning chain along with the final answer. However, there is no guarantee that the reasoning chain accurately reflects the model's true reasoning process behind predicting the answer. In other words, the reasoning chain may "lie" about how the model arrives at the answer, even though it looks superficially plausible.

This lack of faithfulness is concerning because it can mislead users into believing the model is interpretable, when there is actually no causal relationship between the generated reasoning chain and the final answer. This could be dangerous in high-stakes applications like healthcare, legal, etc.

To address this issue, the authors propose a new reasoning framework called Faithful CoT. It decomposes reasoning into two stages - Translation and Problem Solving. In Translation, a language model generates a reasoning chain interleaving natural language and executable symbolic programs. Then in Problem Solving, the symbolic program is deterministically executed to get the final answer. This guarantees that the reasoning chain faithfully explains the answer derivation.

Besides faithfulness, Faithful CoT also aims to improve performance on complex reasoning tasks over standard CoT. The authors demonstrate gains on 10 datasets across math, QA, planning and inference problems.

In summary, the key problem is the lack of faithfulness in prior CoT methods, which Faithful CoT aims to address by decomposing reasoning into a faithful chain generation step and a deterministic execution step.
