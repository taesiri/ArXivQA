# [Infrared and visible Image Fusion with Language-driven Loss in CLIP   Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to integrate complementary information from infrared and visible images into a single image. 
- Existing deep learning methods rely on complex mathematical loss functions to model the fused output, which is difficult without ground truth images.  

Proposed Solution:
- Express the fusion objective using natural language instead of mathematical formulas to avoid explicit modeling of the fused output.  
- Leverage CLIP to encode the language objective and input images into a common embedding space.
- Establish a language-driven fusion model in CLIP space to define expected fusion directions.
- Derive a language-driven loss to align actual image fusion to the embedded model through training.

Main Contributions:
- First work to use language to express the full IVIF objective instead of complex mathematical modeling.
- Construct an embedded language-driven fusion model with CLIP and propose the first CLIP-based multi-modal image fusion method.  
- Develop a language-driven loss for IVIF based on alignment with the embedded fusion model.
- Experiments show significant improvement in fusion quality over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key innovation is using language and CLIP to guide image fusion instead of explicit mathematical modeling. This simpler yet more effective approach allows the model to better learn and generate the desired fused output. Experiments demonstrate clear advantages over existing techniques.
