# [How Well Does GPT-4V(ision) Adapt to Distribution Shifts? A Preliminary   Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07424)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key aspects of the paper:

This paper presents the first extensive evaluation of GPT-4V's capability to adapt to distribution shifts across diverse domains. Through rigorous experiments on 13 datasets spanning natural, medical, and molecular images, the authors systematically assess GPT-4V's zero-shot generalization ability, response to controlled data perturbations, and efficacy of in-context learning for adaptation. Key findings reveal that while GPT-4V demonstrates considerable resilience to natural distribution shifts, its proficiency declines on more specialized datasets. This variability indicates potential gaps in its pretraining data. Tests using Gaussian noise and stylistic transformations further expose GPT-4V's exceptional stability. However, comparisons on engineered distribution shifts show its reasoning occasionally being misled by nuances. While limitations exist, in-context examples markedly boost GPT-4V's adaptation. This comprehensive analysis delineates strengths and weaknesses in GPT-4V's versatility, providing pivotal insights into the adaptability of multimodal foundation models. As the first benchmark on this crucial robustness aspect, it sets a precedent for promoting resilient and reliable AI systems to navigate complex real-world distributions.
