## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing 3D group equivariant CNNs (G-CNNs) for volumetric data rely on parameter-sharing designs which build expensive convolutional units, limiting their application to deep architectures. 
- They are also mostly limited to rotation equivariance and use spherical harmonic bases which only provide angular orthogonality.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose non-parameter-sharing 3D affine G-CNN based on weighted Monte Carlo group convolutions.
- Introduce more expressive spherical Fourier-Bessel (sFB) bases combining angular and radial orthogonality.
- Decompose 3D transform matrix into series of simple transforms to build full affine group.

Contributions:
1) Efficient non-parameter-sharing implementation of 3D affine G-CNN enabled by Monte Carlo method.
2) More expressive sFB bases with both angular and radial orthogonality improving performance.  
3) Demonstrate proposed methods improve state-of-the-art 3D CNNs on medical image segmentation with higher stability and data-efficiency.

In summary, this paper presents an efficient 3D affine equivariant CNN using weighted Monte Carlo group convolutions and expressive spherical Fourier-Bessel filter bases. It shows superior performance over prior rotation-only equivariant methods, improving state-of-the-art 3D CNNs for medical image segmentation. The key innovations are the non-parameter-sharing design and introduction of radially-orthogonal bases within a full 3D affine equivariant framework.
