# [Learning Online Belief Prediction for Efficient POMDP Planning in   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Effective decision-making for autonomous vehicles relies on accurately predicting the future behaviors of other traffic participants. However, existing prediction models are designed and evaluated in an open-loop manner, lacking temporal consistency when applied online. Additionally, current POMDP planners have limited capability in complex real-world situations. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an online learning-based behavior prediction model to dynamically update the beliefs/intentions of other agents. It employs a Transformer encoder and a recurrent GRU model to map observations to latent states and iteratively update latent beliefs. The model can integrate the ego vehicle's intentions to reflect closed-loop interactions. For planning, an option-based Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) method is used to reduce complexity by searching over action sequences. Inside the planner, predicted long-term multi-modal trajectories approximate future belief updates to improve efficiency. A deep Q-network learned online is also used to guide the MCTS search.

Main Contributions:
1) A neural memory-based model that enables online and closed-loop prediction for POMDP planning.

2) An option-based MCTS planner guided by a learned Q-function that acts as a heuristic during tree search.

3) An online learning framework for the prediction and Q-value networks, validated in a simulated environment based on real driving data.

Results show the online update model enhances prediction consistency and accuracy. Using the Q-network to guide MCTS search significantly boosts performance over an imitation learning prior. The option-based MCTS also substantially improves efficiency and performance over the vanilla method.
