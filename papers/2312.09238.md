# [Auto MC-Reward: Automated Dense Reward Design with Large Language Models   for Minecraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09238)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning agents struggle to solve complex, long-horizon tasks in Minecraft due to extremely sparse rewards and huge decision spaces. Existing methods to enable more efficient learning, such as curiosity-driven exploration and goal-conditioned RL, have shown promise in simple environments but their applicability in Minecraft remains uncertain. Humans, on the other hand, can summarize and transfer knowledge from practice to efficiently learn new tasks.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Auto MC-Reward, an automated dense reward design framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It consists of three key components - Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer. The Reward Designer leverages the reasoning and imaginative abilities of LLMs to propose executable Python code for dense reward functions based on task descriptions. The Reward Critic reviews the code to eliminate errors. During training, the Trajectory Analyzer summarizes failure cases from the agent's trajectories and provides suggestions to the Reward Designer to iteratively improve the rewards.

Key Contributions:
- An end-to-end pipeline to automatically generate dense reward functions for Minecraft agents using LLMs 
- A Reward Designer module that converts task specifications to executable reward function code
- A Reward Critic module to validate code correctness before execution
- A Trajectory Analyzer module that gives feedback based on agent failures to iteratively refine rewards

Experiments show Auto MC-Reward significantly boosts learning efficiency across Minecraft tasks like exploring for sparse resources and avoiding lava. The final agent exhibits new intelligent behaviors like circumnavigating lava lakes. Without any hand-crafting, the automated reward design process successfully transfers human-like adaptation skills to enable agents to solve complex, long-horizon Minecraft tasks.
