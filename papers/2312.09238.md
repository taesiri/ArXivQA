# [Auto MC-Reward: Automated Dense Reward Design with Large Language Models   for Minecraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09238)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning agents struggle to solve complex, long-horizon tasks in Minecraft due to extremely sparse rewards and huge decision spaces. Existing methods to enable more efficient learning, such as curiosity-driven exploration and goal-conditioned RL, have shown promise in simple environments but their applicability in Minecraft remains uncertain. Humans, on the other hand, can summarize and transfer knowledge from practice to efficiently learn new tasks.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Auto MC-Reward, an automated dense reward design framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It consists of three key components - Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer. The Reward Designer leverages the reasoning and imaginative abilities of LLMs to propose executable Python code for dense reward functions based on task descriptions. The Reward Critic reviews the code to eliminate errors. During training, the Trajectory Analyzer summarizes failure cases from the agent's trajectories and provides suggestions to the Reward Designer to iteratively improve the rewards.

Key Contributions:
- An end-to-end pipeline to automatically generate dense reward functions for Minecraft agents using LLMs 
- A Reward Designer module that converts task specifications to executable reward function code
- A Reward Critic module to validate code correctness before execution
- A Trajectory Analyzer module that gives feedback based on agent failures to iteratively refine rewards

Experiments show Auto MC-Reward significantly boosts learning efficiency across Minecraft tasks like exploring for sparse resources and avoiding lava. The final agent exhibits new intelligent behaviors like circumnavigating lava lakes. Without any hand-crafting, the automated reward design process successfully transfers human-like adaptation skills to enable agents to solve complex, long-horizon Minecraft tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Auto MC-Reward, an automated dense reward design system leveraging large language models to iteratively improve reward functions for complex Minecraft tasks, significantly enhancing learning efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes Auto MC-Reward, an automated system to design dense reward functions for reinforcement learning agents in complex Minecraft environments, using large language models (LLMs). The key contributions are:

1) It introduces three LLM-based components - Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer - to automatically design, verify, and refine reward functions tailored for specific Minecraft tasks. 

2) It demonstrates that by leveraging the understanding and reasoning abilities of LLMs, Auto MC-Reward can produce interpretable reward functions that lead to significantly improved task success rates and sample efficiency over sparse rewards and other dense reward methods.

3) Experiments on exploration, survival, and creation tasks in Minecraft show that agents trained with Auto MC-Reward's automatically designed rewards develop new beneficial behaviors like avoiding lava and efficiently finding sparse resources.

4) The system provides an automated, generalizable approach to engineering dense rewards for complex, sparse-reward environments, while requiring only task descriptions as input instead of hand-engineering rewards based on expert knowledge.

In summary, the main contribution is using LLMs to automatically design effective dense reward functions for sample-efficient reinforcement learning in Minecraft's complex environment.
