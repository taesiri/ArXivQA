# [SIMPL: A Simple and Efficient Multi-agent Motion Prediction Baseline for   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Motion prediction for autonomous vehicles is critical but faces challenges in context representation and fusion. Scene-centric methods enable single-pass inference but compromise accuracy. Agent-centric methods achieve higher accuracy but require repetitive computations per agent. 
- Downstream planning modules require accurate higher-order trajectory derivatives besides positions. However, independent prediction of these quantities can cause physical inconsistencies.  
- Existing parameterized trajectory representations like polynomials suffer from numerical instability in regression.

Method:
- Proposes SIMPL, a Simple and efficient Motion Prediction baseline using symmetric scene modeling and continuous trajectory parameterization.

- Represents scene using instance-centric features and relative poses for efficiency and accuracy. Employs simple encoders to extract actor and map tokens.

- Proposes Symmetric Fusion Transformer (SFT) for updating instance tokens by message passing using relative poses in a viewpoint-invariant manner. Allows single-pass multi-agent prediction.

- Predicts trajectories as Bézier curves, ensuring smoothness and efficient evaluation of higher-order derivatives. Finds Bézier parameterization is more numerically stable than polynomials.

- Integrates above ideas into a compact model for real-time, accurate, multi-agent prediction.

Contributions:
- Efficiently encodes features for multiple agents while retaining robustness against viewpoint changes.
- Enables effortless retrieval of accurate higher-order trajectory derivatives.
- Compact architecture is simple, efficient, and extensible as a strong baseline.
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Argoverse datasets with faster inference, showing promise for onboard applications.

In summary, SIMPL introduces symmetric scene modeling and continuous trajectory parameterization into a minimalist network for real-time, accurate, and consistent multi-agent motion forecasting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes SIMPL, a simple and efficient baseline for multi-agent motion prediction that achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance via symmetric feature fusion and continuous trajectory parameterization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes SIMPL, a simple and efficient baseline model for multi-agent motion prediction in autonomous driving. SIMPL uses a compact symmetric fusion Transformer to enable efficient trajectory forecasting for all agents simultaneously in one feedforward pass, while retaining accuracy and being robust to viewpoint changes.

2. It introduces a continuous trajectory parameterization method using Bernstein basis polynomials (Bézier curves) in the trajectory decoder. This representation ensures smooth predicted trajectories and allows easy evaluation of states and higher-order derivatives at any time point, which is useful for downstream tasks.

3. Through experiments on two large benchmark datasets, it shows that despite the minimalist architecture, SIMPL achieves highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, SIMPL is faster and has fewer parameters, making it suitable for real-world onboard deployment.

4. It demonstrates the extensibility of SIMPL by adding a simple trajectory refinement module, leading to further performance improvements. This shows SIMPL can serve as an efficient and strong baseline to integrate various advances in motion forecasting.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient, compact yet accurate multi-agent motion forecasting model that is promising for autonomous driving applications. Its simplicity also makes it a strong baseline for extensions.
