# [JDocQA: Japanese Document Question Answering Dataset for Generative   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Document question answering requires understanding both textual and visual elements like figures and tables. Existing datasets are limited, especially for Japanese.
- Generative language models can hallucinate answers not grounded in the context. Mitigating this is an open challenge. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced JDocQA, a new Japanese document QA dataset with 11,600 QA pairs over 5,504 documents covering various formats like slides, reports, websites.
- Has 4 question types - yes/no, factoid, numerical, open-ended. Also includes 1,000 multi-page and 1,788 unanswerable questions.  
- Questions reference both text and visual elements like tables and figures.

Experiments & Results:  
- Tested several Japanese language models by finetuning on JDocQA. Larger models like StableLM performed the best. 
- Finetuning with unanswerable questions helps mitigate hallucination compared to without.
- Added visual modality further improves performance.

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale Japanese document QA dataset requiring visual and textual reasoning.  
- Detailed experiments highlighting model performances, the effect of unanswerable data on hallucination.
- Benchmark for developing document QA models in Japanese, especially multimodal models.

In summary, the paper introduced a new dataset to advance research in Japanese document question answering and analyzed model performances on it. The inclusion of unanswerable questions is a useful aspect to handle hallucination.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces JDocQA, a new Japanese document question answering dataset with 11,600 question-answer pairs over 5,504 documents, featuring four question categories, unanswerable questions, and visual groundings to assess both textual and visual comprehension.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduction of JDocQA, a large-scale Japanese document question answering dataset comprising 5,504 documents and 11,600 question-answer pairs. The dataset requires comprehending both textual and visual information in the documents to answer questions.

2. JDocQA has four question categories - yes/no, factoid, numerical, and open-ended. It also includes 1,000 multi-page questions and 1,788 unanswerable questions.

3. Experiments showing the effectiveness of finetuning large language models on JDocQA for document question answering. Incorporating unanswerable questions during finetuning helps mitigate hallucinated answers.

4. Analysis of multimodal models taking both text and images as input on JDocQA. Models using cropped images of visual elements referenced in questions perform better.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of the new JDocQA dataset to advance research in multimodal document understanding and question answering for Japanese.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Document question answering 
- Multimodal document processing
- Japanese language dataset
- Question-answer pairs 
- Unanswerable questions
- Generative language models
- Instruction tuning
- Textual and visual information
- PDF documents
- Four question categories (yes/no, factoid, numerical, open-ended)
- Hallucination generation
- Large language models (LLMs)

The paper introduces a new Japanese document question answering (JDocQA) dataset for training and evaluating generative language models. The dataset contains over 11,000 question-answer pairs annotated on over 5,500 Japanese PDF documents, spanning four question types. A key aspect is the inclusion of "unanswerable" questions to help models avoid hallucinated answers. Experiments are conducted with various Japanese LLMs to benchmark performance and analyze the impact of unanswerable data and multimodal inputs. So in summary, the key focus is on a new challenging Japanese QA dataset to advance multimodal document understanding and generation through LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new Japanese document question answering dataset called JDocQA. What are some key characteristics of this dataset compared to existing VQA and QA datasets? For example, what type of documents are included and what makes answering questions on these documents challenging?

2. The paper categorizes the questions in JDocQA into 4 types - yes/no, factoid, numerical, and open-ended. Can you explain the differences between these question types and why a diversity of question types is useful for a QA dataset?  

3. The paper mentions incorporating "unanswerable" questions where no answer is contained in the referenced documents. Why is this an important component of a realistic QA dataset? How does adding unanswerable questions potentially help models avoid "hallucinating" answers?

4. What were the key steps involved in creating the JDocQA dataset as outlined in Section 3.2? Can you walk through and explain the document collection, text extraction, annotation procedure, etc.?

5. How exactly did the authors evaluate the performance of different models on JDocQA? What metrics were used for the different question types?

6. What did the experiments reveal about the impact of incorporating unanswerable questions on model performance? How did models trained with vs without unanswerable questions compare?  

7. What trends did the authors notice regarding how different models handle unanswerable questions? For example, what observations were made about OpenCALM-7B and weblab-10B models in this regard?

8. How did multimodal models taking both text and visual inputs compare to text-only models? What are some possible reasons that multimodal models did not hugely outperform text-only models?

9. How were human evaluations conducted and can you summarize what they revealed relative to the model's automatic evaluation metrics? 

10. What are some possible applications, benefits, and limitations of the JDocQA dataset based on the information presented in the paper?
