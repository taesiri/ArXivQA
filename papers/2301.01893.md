# [GIVL: Improving Geographical Inclusivity of Vision-Language Models with   Pre-Training Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01893)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes GIVL, a geographically inclusive vision-language pre-trained model, to address the issue of geographical bias in existing vision-language pre-trained models (VLPs). The key hypothesis is that by pre-training VLPs on a geographically diverse image dataset along with novel pre-training objectives, the models can learn to better understand visual concepts and knowledge from different regions of the world. This should lead to improved performance and more balanced accuracy across images from Western vs non-Western regions on downstream geo-diverse vision-language tasks.The main research questions addressed are:1) How can we construct a geographically diverse pre-training corpus to provide images depicting concepts from diverse regions? 2) What novel pre-training objectives can encourage the model to learn alignments between geo-diverse images and corresponding textual knowledge during pre-training?3) Will the proposed model, GIVL, achieve better performance on geo-diverse vision-language tasks compared to prior VLPs? Can it obtain more balanced accuracy on Western vs non-Western test data?4) Can GIVL still achieve competitive performance on common vision-language tasks, demonstrating its generalizability?To summarize, the central hypothesis is that with a geographically diverse pre-training corpus and objectives aimed at aligning images and knowledge, GIVL can learn improved representations to understand concepts from different world regions. This should lead to state-of-the-art and more equitable performance on downstream geo-diverse vision-language tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing GIVL, a geographically inclusive vision-language pre-trained model, to improve the performance of vision-language models on data from diverse regions and cultures. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Identifying two key attributes of geo-diverse visual concepts that can help learn geo-diverse knowledge: - Concepts in similar categories have unique knowledge and visual characteristics.- Concepts with similar visual features may be completely different categories.2. Proposing two new pre-training objectives based on the attributes:- Image-Knowledge Matching (IKM) to align images with corresponding knowledge and identify category similarities. - Image Edit Checking (IEC) to differentiate visually similar concepts from different categories.3. Achieving state-of-the-art and more balanced performance on geo-diverse vision-language tasks like MaRVL, GD-VCR, and WIT compared to similar-sized models trained on similar data.4. Obtaining competitive results on common vision-language benchmarks like GQA and COCO captioning compared to models trained with more data.In summary, the key contribution is developing a new pre-training approach to improve geographical inclusivity and balance the performance of vision-language models across diverse data sources and cultures. The new objectives help the model learn nuanced geo-diverse knowledge.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key things about how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other related works in vision-language pre-training and geographical inclusivity:- It proposes two new pre-training objectives - Image-Knowledge Matching (IKM) and Image Edit Checking (IEC) - to improve geographical inclusivity of vision-language models. These are novel ideas not explored in prior works. - The paper evaluates the proposed methods on several geo-diverse vision-language benchmarks like MaRVL, GD-VCR, WIT retrieval etc. Most prior works have not extensively evaluated on such geo-diverse datasets.- The model GIVL achieves new state-of-the-art results on these geo-diverse benchmarks, outperforming prior works by significant margins. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods for improving geographic inclusivity.- The scale of model and data used for GIVL is comparable to other recent vision-language models like VinVL, X-VLM, ALBEF etc. So the comparisons are fair and improvements can be attributed to the proposed objectives.- The paper also evaluates GIVL on common vision-language tasks like VQA, NLVR2 etc. and shows it achieves competitive performance to other models trained on similar scale of data. This demonstrates the generalizability of GIVL.- Overall, by extensively evaluating on geo-diverse datasets and proposing novel pre-training methods tailored for geographic inclusivity, this work makes important contributions to an emerging area of research not sufficiently addressed in prior works. The gains over strong baselines are noteworthy.In summary, the paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in geographical inclusivity for vision-language pre-training through new objectives, extensive evaluations, and strong empirical results on geo-diverse benchmarks. It opens up an important direction for further research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Expanding the scope of geo-diverse visual concepts covered in the pre-training datasets. The authors note that their proposed method focuses mainly on concepts related to people, clothing, food, etc. Expanding to include more concepts like architecture, nature, technology, etc. could further improve geographic inclusivity.- Incorporating more geo-diverse multimodal datasets for pre-training and evaluation. The authors use WIT as their primary pre-training source and evaluate on datasets like MaRVL, GD-VCR and WIT retrieval. Expanding the variety of geo-diverse datasets could help further validate and improve the methods.- Exploring different methods to acquire visual concept categories and align concepts between image regions and text. The authors use simple heuristics that could be further improved with more advanced NLP and vision techniques.- Studying the tradeoffs between model size, pre-training data scale, and geo-diverse performance. The authors show GIVL can match larger models trained on more data, but more analysis could reveal optimal configurations.- Extending the approach to other modalities like video and audio where geographic diversity also exists. The authors focus on images and text, but the ideas could generalize.- Testing the approach on a broader range of downstream tasks to better analyze tradeoffs with geographic inclusivity vs. general V&L performance.- Developing methods to further close the gap between Western and non-Western performance on tasks while retaining overall accuracy.In summary, the authors propose continuing work on geo-diverse data, model architectures, pre-training objectives, and evaluation to further improve geographic inclusivity of vision-language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes GIVL, a Geographically Inclusive Vision-Language Pre-trained model that aims to achieve more balanced performance across different geographical regions. The authors observe that current vision-language models exhibit significant performance gaps on data from Western vs non-Western regions due to geographical biases in the pre-training data and process. To address this, GIVL leverages the Wikipedia Image-Text dataset which contains more diverse images and knowledge from around the world. The authors propose two new pre-training objectives - Image-Knowledge Matching and Image Edit Checking - to better capture the alignment between images and text knowledge as well as differences between visually similar concepts across regions. Experiments demonstrate that GIVL achieves state-of-the-art and more balanced performance on geo-diverse vision-language tasks compared to prior work. The model also obtains competitive results on common vision-language benchmarks, showing the generalizability of the pre-training approach. Overall, this work provides methods to improve the geographical inclusivity of vision-language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces GIVL, a geographically inclusive vision-language pre-trained model that aims to achieve better performance on understanding images from diverse regions and cultures. The authors observe that current vision-language models exhibit significant performance gaps between Western and non-Western images due to geographical bias in the pre-training data and objectives. To address this, GIVL is pre-trained on a more geographically diverse dataset of Wikipedia images along with two new pre-training objectives - Image-Knowledge Matching (IKM) and Image Edit Checking (IEC). IKM encourages the model to learn alignments between images and corresponding cultural knowledge from Wikipedia. IEC helps the model differentiate between visually similar concepts from different cultures. Experiments demonstrate that GIVL achieves state-of-the-art performance on several geo-diverse vision-language benchmarks including multicultural visual reasoning, geo-diverse visual commonsense reasoning, and Wikipedia image-text retrieval. On these tasks, GIVL substantially outperforms prior models and reduces the gap between Western and non-Western performance. The results highlight the benefits of GIVL's geographically inclusive pre-training. Moreover, GIVL also obtains competitive performance on common vision-language tasks, illustrating its generalization ability. Overall, this work provides an important step towards developing more inclusive vision-language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes GIVL, a geographically inclusive vision-language pre-trained model. The key idea is to design new pre-training objectives that encourage the model to learn knowledge about visual concepts from different geographical regions and cultures. Specifically, the authors propose two new objectives called Image-Knowledge Matching (IKM) and Image Edit Checking (IEC). IKM requires the model to not only judge if input textual knowledge matches an image, but also identify if the knowledge describes a visual concept in a similar category to what is shown in the image. This enables connecting concepts across regions that may look different visually but share semantic similarity. IEC identifies if a visual concept in an image is replaced with a similar looking but semantically different concept from an irrelevant category. This helps the model better differentiate between visually similar concepts. Through experiments on several geo-diverse vision-language tasks, the authors demonstrate that GIVL achieves state-of-the-art and more balanced performance across geographical regions compared to prior methods.
