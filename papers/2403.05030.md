# [Defending Against Unforeseen Failure Modes with Latent Adversarial   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05030)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI systems can exhibit harmful unintended behaviors post-deployment, despite extensive testing and adversarial training (AT) pre-deployment. This happens due to systematic differences between the failure modes developers identify vs the ones models exhibit post-deployment (e.g. trojans, jailbreaks, novel attacks).
- Searching the vast input space to find vulnerabilities is challenging. Many failure modes can go unnoticed.
- AT requires examples of failures to fix them, but can struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of attacks seen during training.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without needing to generate inputs that trigger them. 
- LAT applies adversarial perturbations to the latent representations instead of the inputs. As information flows through the neural network layers, the latents develop more compressed and structured representations. 
- Hypothesis: Failures that are hard to elicit from the input space may be easier to elicit and remove via the latent space without needing demonstration examples.

Key Contributions:
- Show LAT can help remove trojans and improve robustness to novel attacks in image classification, text classification and text generation tasks.
- Find that LAT in the optimal layer usually Pareto dominates AT w.r.t clean and robust performance. 
- Cautionary result: Show examples where AT reduces robustness to unseen attacks and where AT/LAT can entrench trojans.

Significance:
- Suggests LAT could be a useful practical tool for making models more robust to unforeseen failures like trojans, jailbreaks, novel attacks. Works by shaping latent space.
- As a relaxation of input space attacks, LAT may enable stronger assurances of robustness in high-stakes applications.

Limitations:
- Only tested up to 7B parameter models and did not evaluate against jailbreaks. 
- LAT performance is sensitive to choice of layer.

Future Work: 
- Explore methods to parameterize, regularize and restrict latent attacks.
- Use latent attacks to evaluate latent capabilities. 
- Use targeted LAT to train out specific unwanted behaviors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using latent adversarial training to improve model robustness to unforeseen failure modes and shows that it often outperforms standard input-space adversarial training across image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks, while cautioning that both techniques can sometimes harm robustness if improperly configured.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using latent adversarial training (LAT) to make models more robust to failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers pre-deployment, such as trojans, jailbreaks, novel attacks, and black swans. Specifically:

1. The paper shows that LAT can help remove trojans and improve robustness against novel attacks in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks. 

2. Across diverse experiments, the paper finds that LAT usually Pareto dominates standard adversarial training (AT) with respect to both clean data performance and robustness to the unforeseen failure modes.

3. The paper demonstrates cautionary instances where AT can sometimes reduce robustness and cases where poorly configured AT and LAT can entrench trojans rather than remove them.

In summary, the main contribution is using LAT as a method to defend against unforeseen vulnerabilities without requiring examples that trigger them, showing that it often outperforms AT, and highlighting risks like trojan entrenchment. The results suggest LAT could be a useful practical tool for making models more robust to risks that are difficult to identify pre-deployment.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Latent adversarial training (LAT): The main method studied in the paper, where adversarial perturbations are applied to a model's latent representations rather than its inputs.

- Unforeseen/unanticipated failure modes: The types of vulnerabilities the paper aims to defend against, including trojans, jailbreaks, novel attacks, and black swans. These are problems that are difficult to find during development but can appear post-deployment. 

- Adversarial training (AT): The standard technique of applying adversarial examples during training to improve robustness. LAT is compared to AT in the experiments.

- Pareto frontier: Used to characterize tradeoffs between clean accuracy and robustness to different failure modes. LAT tends to Pareto dominate AT in the experiments.  

- Vision models: Tested LAT on ImageNet classification using a ResNet-50 architecture.

- Language models: Tested LAT for text classification using DeBERTa-v3-large and for text generation using Llama-7b-chat.

- Robustness harms: Cautionary instances observed where techniques like AT and LAT sometimes reduced robustness instead of improving it.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that failures are easier to elicit from the latent space than the input space. What evidence or reasoning supports this claim? How could this hypothesis be further tested? 

2. The authors select a single layer to attack during latent adversarial training. What criteria guide this layer selection? How sensitive are the results to the choice of layer?

3. Latent adversarial training requires attacking neural activations rather than discrete tokens. What difficulties does this introduce compared to typical adversarial text attacks? How are they addressed?

4. When applying latent perturbations, what justifies using an Lp norm constraint versus other possible regularization methods? How does normalization affect results?

5. For text models, the authors perform adversarial training in the embedding space only. What are the tradeoffs between embedding versus latent space adversarial training?

6. Trojan removal results differed substantially between the Anthropic and BeaverTails datasets. What explains this discrepancy? How might the data distribution impact latent adversarial training?  

7. The vision experiments show latent adversarial training Pareto dominating input adversarial training. Do the authors expect this relationship to continue scaling to much larger models and datasets?

8. The authors identify instances where adversarial training harms robustness. What causes this counterintuitive behavior? How might it be prevented?

9. The paper studies untargeted attacks. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using targeted latent attacks? How feasible are targeted latent attacks?

10. What safety assurances can and cannot be provided by latent adversarial training? In what application domains might this technique be responsibly deployed today?
