# [Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01030)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents that can perform actions like invoking tools and controlling robots. However, existing approaches for expanding LLMs' action space have limitations:
    - Using text or JSON actions restricts the scope of possible actions and flexibility (e.g. inability to compose tools).
    - Approaches relying on code generation cannot dynamically adjust actions based on environment observations and feedback.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "CodeAct", a framework where LLM agents use executable Python code to consolidate actions. 
- Integrated with a Python interpreter, CodeAct allows:
    - Execution of code actions and dynamic adjustment of prior actions based on new observations through multi-turn interactions.
    - Use of existing software packages to expand action space instead of hand-crafted tools.
    - Leveraging automated feedback (e.g. error messages) for self-debugging and improving actions.

Main Contributions:
- Extensive experiments showing CodeAct outperforms text/JSON actions by up to 20% higher success rate on complex tasks while requiring 30% fewer actions.
- Introduction of "CodeActInstruct", an instruction tuning dataset of 7k high-quality multi-turn LLM-environment interactions using CodeAct.
- "CodeActAgent", an open-source LLM agent finetuned on CodeActInstruct+conversation data, uniquely tailored to leverage Python packages and self-debug through code execution.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using executable code to expand LLM agents' action space, supported by a new dataset and model specialized for code-based interaction. The framework, data and model are open-sourced for community use.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using executable Python code as actions for large language model agents, shows quantitative evidence that it outperforms alternatives like text or JSON actions, and releases an open-source model finetuned on a new multi-turn interaction dataset CodeActInstruct to interact with environments by executing code.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes \approach, a framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to use executable Python code as actions. This consolidates the action space and allows leverage of control flow, data flow, existing software packages, and automated debugging.

2. It provides an extensive analysis with 17 LLMs showing the benefits of using \approach over alternatives like text or JSON for actions. The key benefits are better performance (up to 20\% higher success rate) and higher efficiency (requiring up to 30\% fewer actions).

3. It introduces a new benchmark called \evalname with 82 human-curated tasks requiring complex coordination of multiple tools in multi-turn interactions. This benchmarks the capabilities enabled by \approach.

4. It collects a multi-turn interaction dataset called \dataname focused on agent-environment interactions (7k trajectories across information seeking, software usage, external memory, robot planning). This is used to train the open-source \modelname model.

5. It shows \modelname, tuned from Llama2 and Mistral-7B, improves performance on agent tasks using \approach while maintaining capabilities on general LLM benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and analyzing the \approach framework for LLM action, introducing benchmarks and data to analyze its benefits, and releasing trained models to enable adoption.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using executable Python code as the action space for LLM agents. What are some key advantages of using code over alternatives like text or JSON for actions? How does code help in problems requiring complex tool orchestration?

2. The paper introduces a new benchmark called M^3ToolEval for evaluating LLM performance on complex tool orchestration problems. What makes this benchmark unique compared to prior tool-use benchmarks? What capabilities did the authors intend to evaluate with this benchmark?  

3. The paper shows performance gains from using code actions compared to alternatives, especially as model scale increases. What underlying factors contribute to these gains? How canprompt engineering or other techniques further improve the code action performance?

4. The paper highlights the ability of code actions to leverage existing software packages and enable self-debugging through multi-turn interactions. Can you elaborate more on these capabilities and how they can be beneficial for LLM agents? Provide some examples.

5. The authors collect a new instruction tuning dataset called CodeActInstruct. What considerations went into the dataset curation process? What capabilities was this dataset intended to impart on the finetuned LLM agent models?

6. For the finetuned LLM agent CodeActAgent, the authors use a mixture of CodeActInstruct and general conversation data. What is the motivation behind using this mixture? What are the tradeoffs compared to using CodeActInstruct alone?

7. The finetuned CodeActAgent model shows performance gains on code action tasks but mixed results on text action tasks. What factors might explain this behavior? How can the model be improved to generalize better across action modalities?  

8. Between the Llama2 and Mistral based CodeActAgent models, an anomaly is noted in the model evaluation results. What might explain this anomaly and how can it be mitigated in future work?

9. The paper demonstrates sophisticated capabilities like leveraging Python packages and self-debugging enabled through code actions. How do these capabilities expand the potential applications for LLM agents vs traditional text or JSON actions? Provide some examples of complex real-world problems that could be tackled.  

10. The paper proposes an initial prototype for LLM agents focused on agent-environment interactions. What are some directions for future work in expanding the scope and capabilities of such agents? What ethical considerations need to be addressed as progress is made on more advanced autonomous agents?
