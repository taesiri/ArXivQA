# [Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback   Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current intrusion-tolerant systems rely on inefficient recovery strategies like periodic or manual recoveries. They also use static replication factors that do not adapt to attacks. This leads to high downtimes and operational costs. 

Proposed Solution - Tolerancee:
The paper proposes a novel intrusion-tolerant system called Tolerancee that uses two levels of feedback control:

1) Local control: A node controller on each node decides when to recover compromised nodes based on intrusion detection alerts. This is modeled as a machine replacement problem. 

2) Global control: A system controller manages the replication factor across nodes based on state estimates from node controllers. This is modeled as an inventory replenishment problem.

The optimal control strategies for both problems are shown to have threshold structure, which enables efficient computation.

Main Contributions:
1) New intrusion-tolerant system architecture using two-level feedback control 
2) Formulation as operational research problems to leverage well-established techniques
3) Proof of structural properties for optimal control strategies  
4) Efficient algorithms to compute the strategies
5) Implementation and evaluation showing improved service availability and reduced downtime

The key insight is to leverage control theory to make intrusion recovery and replication adaptive through feedback, instead of relying on fixed schedules or manuals. By connecting with classical problems in operations research, the system can guarantee correctness and efficiently compute optimal strategies.
