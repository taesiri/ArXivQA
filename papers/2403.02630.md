# [FedHCDR: Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation with Hypergraph Signal   Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) utilizes user data from multiple domains to enhance recommendation performance. However, existing CDR methods require sharing raw user data across domains, violating data privacy regulations like GDPR. Federated learning allows collaborative training without sharing raw user data, but federated cross-domain recommendation (FedCDR) faces the challenge of data heterogeneity across domains, hurting performance.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FedHCDR, a federated cross-domain recommendation framework that addresses data heterogeneity via hypergraph signal decoupling (HSD). 

Key ideas:

1) HSD decouples user features into domain-exclusive and domain-shared using high-pass and low-pass hypergraph filters. This avoids negative transfer from aggregating raw heterogeneous user data.

2) A local-global bi-directional transfer algorithm trains the decoupled representations, balancing local domain-exclusive and global domain-shared features. 

3) A hypergraph contrastive learning (HCL) module enhances learning of domain-shared user relationships by perturbing the user hypergraph.

Main Contributions:

1) A novel FedCDR framework (FedHCDR) that enables collaborative training of better CDR models while ensuring privacy.

2) Introduction of HSD to decouple heterogeneous user data into domain-exclusive and domain-shared representations, avoiding negative transfer.

3) A local-global bi-directional transfer algorithm to train the decoupled representations.

4) Devising a HCL module to learn superior domain-shared user relationship information.

Experiments show FedHCDR significantly outperforms existing FedCDR methods on real-world Amazon datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
