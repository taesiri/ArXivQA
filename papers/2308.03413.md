# [GaFET: Learning Geometry-aware Facial Expression Translation from   In-The-Wild Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03413)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to achieve high-fidelity and geometry-aware facial expression translation from a single image. The key hypotheses are:1. 3D face geometry can be used to effectively decouple facial expression from other attributes like identity and pose. 2. A transformer-based module can align and fuse expression-related texture details with geometric representations to generate complete expression features.3. Training with pseudo-paired data constructed by a pre-trained de-expression model can reduce the difficulty of learning from unpaired in-the-wild images.4. Carefully designed losses and network architecture can enable high-quality facial expression translation on high-resolution images.The overall goal is to develop a framework that leverages 3D geometry, feature alignment, and unpaired training to translate facial expressions in a disentangled and controllable manner, while generating photorealistic results on diverse in-the-wild images. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to existing facial animation techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel geometry-aware facial expression translation (GaFET) framework that can achieve high-quality and accurate facial expression manipulation. 2. It introduces a Multi-level Feature Aligned Transformer (MFAT) module to complement the lack of texture details in the geometry-based expression representation and align expression features from different spatial locations.3. It designs a De-expression model based on StyleGAN to construct pseudo paired data, which reduces the difficulty of training with unlabeled and unpaired in-the-wild images.4. Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art facial expression manipulation methods in terms of image quality, expression accuracy, and ease of use. In summary, the key contribution is the propose of the GaFET framework, which leverages parametric 3D face geometry to represent expressions and aligns multi-level features to generate high-fidelity results. The introduction of the MFAT module and De-expression model further improves the framework's capability. Experiments demonstrate clear advantages over other facial expression editing techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel geometry-aware facial expression translation framework called GaFET that achieves high-quality and accurate expression manipulation through the use of 3D parametric face representations, a Multi-level Feature Aligned Transformer module, and a De-expression model, without requiring annotated training data.
