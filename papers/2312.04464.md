# [Horizon-Free and Instance-Dependent Regret Bounds for Reinforcement   Learning with General Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04464)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning algorithm, termed UCRL-WVTR, for model-based reinforcement learning with general function approximation. The key contributions are: (1) It achieves the first horizon-free and instance-dependent regret bound for this setting, eliminating the polynomial dependency on the planning horizon. (2) The regret bound matches the minimax lower bound for linear mixture MDPs up to logarithmic factors, showing its sharpness. (3) The algorithm is computationally efficient given access to a regression oracle. These results are enabled by novel algorithm designs of weighted value-targeted regression and a high-order moment estimator, as well as new analyses including a concentration inequality for weighted non-linear regression and refined analyses that connect the regret to instance-dependent quantities. Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed method and corroborate the theoretical findings. Overall, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning theory and algorithms by tackling a long-standing open problem of achieving efficient, horizon-free and instance-dependent learning for general function approximation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning algorithm for general function approximation that achieves both horizon-free and instance-dependent regret bounds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning algorithm called UCRL-WVTR for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with general function approximation. The main contributions are:

1) The algorithm achieves both horizon-free and instance-dependent regret bounds. Specifically, the regret bound eliminates the polynomial dependency on the planning horizon H, only depending on H logarithmically. It also depends on problem-specific quantities, making the bound tighter than worst-case regret. 

2) For linear mixture MDPs, the algorithm matches the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors, showing the bound is sharp.

3) The algorithm is computationally efficient given access to a regression oracle for optimizing over the function class.

4) The analysis features a new concentration inequality for weighted non-linear regression and novel expansions relating higher order moments of value functions. These are key to obtaining the horizon-free and instance-dependent properties.

5) Experiments in RiverSwim validate the algorithm's practical effectiveness over prior approaches.

In summary, this is the first efficient reinforcement learning algorithm achieving both horizon-free and instance-dependent regret for general function approximation, with sharp guarantees for linear mixture MDPs. The algorithm design, analysis, and experiments represent significant advances over prior art.

The paper proposes an algorithm called UCRL-WVTR for model-based reinforcement learning with general function approximation. The key features are using weighted value-targeted regression and a high-order moment estimator to get better model estimates. Theoretical analysis shows the algorithm achieves horizon-free and instance-dependent regret bounds, eliminates polynomial dependence on the planning horizon, and matches minimax lower bounds in some cases. There is also an emphasis on computational efficiency using regression oracles. So those would be some of the main key terms and concepts related to this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new algorithm called UCRL-WVTR. Can you explain in detail the key components of this algorithm, especially the weighted value-targeted regression framework and high-order moment estimator? What motivates these novel designs?

2. The paper shows that UCRL-WVTR achieves an instance-dependent regret bound that eliminates the polynomial dependence on the planning horizon H. What is the intuition behind why this method is able to attain a horizon-free regret? What aspects of the algorithm and analysis enable this? 

3. How does UCRL-WVTR handle the challenge of computational efficiency given the non-linear function approximation setting? Explain the use of the regression oracle and how it allows efficient planning via point-wise bonus terms.

4. The cornerstone of the analysis is the weighted non-linear least squares concentration inequality in Theorem 3.1. How does this differ from previous analyses for linear mixture MDPs? Why is a new approach needed for the general function approximation setting?

5. Explain in detail the higher order expansion analysis in Section 4.2 and how relationships are established between variance terms $S_m$ and summation of bonuses $R_m$. Why is this expansion done for $M = O(\log(KH))$ levels?

6. How does the proof manage to make the final regret bound depend on the instance-dependent quantity $\mathcal{Q}^*$ instead of the worst-case $V_1^*K$? What is the intuition for why $\mathcal{Q}^*$ captures stochasticity of the MDP?

7. For linear mixture MDPs, the regret bound matches existing lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Walk through how Corollary 4.1 is derived from the main result. What does this say about the sharpness of the overall analysis?

8. The high-order moment estimator was used in prior work on tabular and linear mixture MDPs. What are the additional challenges in employing this variance reduction technique under general function approximation?

9. How does the concept of generalized Eluder dimension extend the original definition by Russo and Van Roy (2013) to accommodate the weighted regression setting? What role does this play in the regret analysis?

10. From an application perspective, what types of problems would be best suited for using UCRL-WVTR? Are there any major limitations or drawbacks of the method to consider?
