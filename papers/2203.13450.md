## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions for deep active learning:

1. Better leveraging unlabeled data during training in the DAL process under very few label regimes: The authors note that recent work has shown that semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques can subsume much of the benefit of deep active learning. They suggest exploring ways to better utilize unlabeled data during DAL training when there are very limited labeled examples.

2. Task-specific DAL: The authors note that DAL may not work well for certain complex tasks like visual question answering. They suggest exploring task-specific DAL modifications to handle such domains.

3. Obtaining better feature representations: The authors suggest that limitations in DAL performance may be due to suboptimal feature learning. Improving feature representations could lead to better DAL performance.

4. Considering various dataset properties: Factors like collective outliers, rare classes, imbalance, and large unlabeled pools can impact DAL. The authors suggest studying how different data distributions and properties affect DAL.

5. Applying DAL to new data-insufficient domains: The authors suggest exploring the use of DAL in domains like medical imaging, autonomous driving, etc. where labeled data is scarce. Task-specific modifications may be needed.

6. Scaling up DAL: The authors note interest in scaling DAL to very large batch sizes. New methodologies may be needed to transcend current limits.

7. DAL under distribution shift: Studying how DAL performs under dataset shift conditions is an open problem. Developing more robust DAL techniques is an area for research.

Overall, the main suggested directions are: better leveraging unlabeled data, task-specific DAL, obtaining better representations, studying DAL under different data distributions, applying DAL to new domains, scaling DAL, and handling distribution shift.
