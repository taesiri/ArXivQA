# [Video Dehazing via a Multi-Range Temporal Alignment Network with   Physical Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09757)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively leverage haze priors and temporal information for video dehazing. 

Specifically, the authors propose a novel framework (MAP-Net) that contains two main components to tackle this problem:

1. A memory-based physical prior guidance module that encodes haze-related features into long-range memory to provide prior guidance for scene radiance recovery. 

2. A multi-range scene radiance recovery module that aligns and aggregates features from adjacent frames at multiple ranges to better capture temporal dependencies.

The key hypothesis is that by disentangling features according to the haze image formation model and explicitly modeling haze priors and multi-range temporal alignment, the proposed method can achieve improved video dehazing performance compared to existing approaches. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets verify this hypothesis.

In summary, the central research question is how to effectively utilize prior knowledge and temporal information for video dehazing, which is addressed through the proposed memory-based guidance and multi-range recovery modules within the MAP-Net framework. The core hypothesis is that explicit modeling of haze priors and multi-range alignment leads to superior results.
