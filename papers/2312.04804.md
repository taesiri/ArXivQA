# [Hate Cannot Drive out Hate: Forecasting Conversation Incivility   following Replies to Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04804)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new task of predicting the incivility of conversations following replies to hate speech. The authors propose a metric to measure conversation incivility that considers not just the ratio of uncivil comments but also the number of comments and unique participants. This metric better approximates human judgments of incivility compared to prior metrics. The authors apply their metric to a new Reddit dataset spanning diverse communities. A linguistic analysis reveals differences in replies that lead to high versus low incivility conversations. Experimental results find that models incorporating both the hateful comment and reply as input perform best at classifying incivility levels, although performance is still modest. The analysis also shows it is easier to distinguish between replies eliciting the most and least uncivil conversations. Overall, this work sheds light on the outcomes of replies to hate speech and provides a building block for systems to highlight content likely to spur additional incivility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a metric to measure conversation incivility following replies to hate speech, analyzes differences in language between replies that lead to high vs low incivility, and experiments with models to predict incivility levels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing the task of predicting the incivility of conversations following replies to hate speech. Specifically, the authors:

1) Propose a new metric to measure conversation incivility that considers not only the number of uncivil comments but also the number of civil comments and unique authors involved. This metric better approximates human judgments.

2) Create a new corpus of 34,115 replies to hate speech from Reddit, along with the follow-up conversations, and assess their incivility levels using the proposed metric. 

3) Perform a linguistic analysis showing differences in language usage between replies eliciting high vs low conversation incivility.

4) Experiment with models to predict the incivility level (high, medium, low) of the conversation following a reply to hate speech. Additionally, they differentiate between replies eliciting the top-k% and bottom-k% highest/lowest incivility scores.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a new task and metric for assessing and predicting conversation incivility following replies to hate speech, and providing models and a dataset to work on this task.

The paper introduces the task of predicting the incivility of conversations following replies to hate speech on Reddit. It proposes a new metric to measure conversation incivility that considers both civil and uncivil comments as well as user behaviors. The paper analyzes the language of replies that lead to high versus low incivility conversations, and experiments with models to forecast conversation incivility levels after replies. Key aspects explored include using the hateful comment text in addition to the reply, pretraining on related tasks, and blending additional training data. The analysis also looks at differentiating the most and least uncivil replies rather than all three levels. Overall, key terms cover hate speech, counterspeech, conversation modeling, forecasting incivility, and linguistic analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new metric to measure conversation incivility that considers both the number of uncivil and civil comments as well as the number of unique authors. How does this metric differ from prior metrics and why is it argued to be more sound?

2. The paper conducts a manual validation of the proposed conversation incivility metric. Can you describe the process that was used for this validation and the key findings that provided evidence that the metric better approximates human judgments?

3. The linguistic analysis reveals several differences in the language used in replies that elicit high versus low conversation incivility. Can you describe 2-3 of the most notable differences that were found? Why might these linguistic factors correlate with incivility levels?

4. The paper experiments with blending additional training data during the learning process. Explain this blending technique and discuss why it provided better results compared to pretraining alone. What are some limitations of this approach?

5. In addition to predicting high/medium/low conversation incivility levels, the paper also experiments with differentiating the top-k% and bottom-k% extreme cases. Why is this also an important task and what key finding emerged about the difficulty of this task as k varies?

6. The error analysis reveals rhetorical questions as the most common error type. Why does the model struggle with rhetorical questions in this task and how might this issue be addressed in future work?

7. The replies only model sets a relatively strong baseline. Why is it still beneficial to also provide the model with the original hateful content as additional input? What insights does this provide about the importance of context?

8. How exactly were uncivil comments identified? Discuss any limitations related to relying on automatic classifiers for identifying uncivil behaviors.  

9. The study focuses exclusively on Reddit data. Discuss some limitations of this data source and how the findings might differ in other online discussion platforms.

10. The ethical considerations section acknowledges some risks related to releasing the dataset publicly. Discuss some strategies the authors might use to mitigate these risks while still allowing the data to be reused for research.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Responding to hate speech (e.g. with counterspeech) is assumed to stop the spread of hatred online, but there is little evidence supporting this assumption. Some replies may elicit additional incivility instead.
- Existing work lacks analysis of the outcomes of replies to hate speech in terms of the incivility of follow-up conversations.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new task of predicting the incivility level (high/medium/low) of conversations following replies to hate speech. 
- Propose a metric to quantify conversation incivility based on number of civil/uncivil comments and unique participants. Shows this metric better matches human judgement.

Main Contributions:
- Create a corpus of 34k Reddit replies to hate comments labeled with conversation incivility levels.
- Linguistic analysis shows differences in language use for replies eliciting high vs low incivility conversations.
- Experiment with models to predict incivility levels. Best model uses hate comment + reply and gets 0.52 F1.
- Analysis of model errors reveals challenges like detecting rhetoric questions and sarcasm.  
- Show models can distinguish top/bottom 5% replies by conversation incivility with 0.76 F1.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the task of forecasting outcomes of replies to hate speech is challenging but feasible to some extent using proposed conversation incivility metric and modeling techniques. Key insight is that some replies can increase rather than decrease incivility.
