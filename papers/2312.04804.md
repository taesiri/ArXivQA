# [Hate Cannot Drive out Hate: Forecasting Conversation Incivility   following Replies to Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04804)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new task of predicting the incivility of conversations following replies to hate speech. The authors propose a metric to measure conversation incivility that considers not just the ratio of uncivil comments but also the number of comments and unique participants. This metric better approximates human judgments of incivility compared to prior metrics. The authors apply their metric to a new Reddit dataset spanning diverse communities. A linguistic analysis reveals differences in replies that lead to high versus low incivility conversations. Experimental results find that models incorporating both the hateful comment and reply as input perform best at classifying incivility levels, although performance is still modest. The analysis also shows it is easier to distinguish between replies eliciting the most and least uncivil conversations. Overall, this work sheds light on the outcomes of replies to hate speech and provides a building block for systems to highlight content likely to spur additional incivility.
