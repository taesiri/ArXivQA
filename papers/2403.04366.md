# [Enhancing Court View Generation with Knowledge Injection and Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Court View Generation (CVG) aims to generate court views based on plaintiff claims and fact descriptions. It is an important task in Legal AI.
- Existing natural language generation methods rely on pre-trained language models (PLMs) which lack domain knowledge for the legal domain. This leads to incomplete or erroneous court views.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a Knowledge Injection and Guidance (KIG) method to address the lack of domain knowledge in PLMs for CVG.

- Knowledge Injection:
   - Inject keyword knowledge to initialize prompt embeddings. This captures fine-grained claim information.
   - Inject label definition knowledge through a label attention mechanism. This helps the model identify and emphasize claim-related information.

- Knowledge Guidance:
   - A generating navigator is proposed to guide knowledge utilization at inference time without changing the model architecture. 
   - It dynamically adjusts the decoding distributions to guide appropriate responses to claims.

Main Contributions:

- An efficient way to incorporate domain knowledge into PLMs via prompt tuning without heavy fine-tuning.

- A generating navigator that provides knowledge guidance during inference without altering model architecture. This allows easy transferability to other models.

- Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Outperforms best baseline by 11.87% on claim response metrics.

- Designed new automatic evaluation metrics to assess model's claim response ability.

In summary, the paper presents an effective approach to address the lack of domain knowledge in CVG by injecting knowledge and guiding knowledge utilization in PLMs. The method is efficient and achieves strong empirical results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a Knowledge Injection and Guidance method to efficiently incorporate domain knowledge into pretrained language models through prompt tuning and a generating navigator for improving court view generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Investigating the task of court view generation (CVG) by taking into account the need for incorporating domain knowledge. 

2. Proposing a Knowledge Injection and Guidance (KIG) method that includes a prompt encoder for efficient knowledge injection and a navigator for guiding knowledge utilization during text generation. The navigator is transferable to other PLMs.

3. Designing claim response metrics specifically for evaluating the quality of court view generation. 

4. Conducting comprehensive experiments on real-world data that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KIG method compared to several strong baselines. The method improves the best baseline by 11.87% on the claim response metric.

In summary, the paper makes contributions in proposing a novel method for knowledge-aware court view generation, designing specialized evaluation metrics, and showing empirically that the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a real-world dataset. A key advantage is efficiently incorporating domain knowledge into large language models.
