# [TablePuppet: A Generic Framework for Relational Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15839)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of relational federated learning (RFL), where the goal is to collaboratively train machine learning models over decentralized relational databases that require SQL operations like joins and unions to compose the training data. This scenario arises commonly when training data is stored across multiple organizations' databases. Existing federated learning approaches like horizontal FL and vertical FL are insufficient for handling RFL because they assume the decentralized data can be simply aligned without needing joins or unions. RFL introduces unique challenges around handling one-to-many data relationships, reducing overhead from duplicate tuples, and protecting privacy of both features and labels.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes TablePuppet, a generic framework for RFL. The key idea is to decompose the learning process into two steps: (1) learning over join (LoJ) and (2) learning over union (LoU). Specifically, LoJ pushes learning from the joined table down onto the individual vertical tables, while LoU further pushes learning down onto the horizontal partitions. TablePuppet employs optimization strategies to reduce computation and communication complexity introduced by duplicate tuples. It also extends differential privacy techniques to provide privacy guarantees for both features and labels. TablePuppet unifies the implementation of two common training algorithms, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), through a server-client architecture and three physical operators that abstract their computation and communication.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes and defines the RFL problem of learning over union of conjunctive queries across distributed relational databases 
- Proposes TablePuppet, the first generic framework to address RFL through decomposed learning over joins and unions
- Incorporates computation/communication optimizations to handle duplicate tuples from joins
- Provides privacy guarantees for both features and labels via differential privacy
- Implements SGD and ADMM algorithms atop TablePuppet and analyzes their complexity
- Empirically evaluates TablePuppet on real-world datasets, showing its ability to match centralized baselines in accuracy while outperforming counterparts in efficiency


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes TablePuppet, a generic relational federated learning framework that decomposes machine learning model training over joins and unions of distributed relational tables into learning over join and learning over union steps, with optimization and differential privacy techniques to reduce communication overhead and ensure data privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It proposes and formalizes a new problem called "relational federated learning" (RFL), which aims to train machine learning models over relational tables across distributed databases using operations like joins and unions. This is more complex than existing horizontal and vertical federated learning approaches.

2. It presents a framework called TablePuppet for addressing the RFL problem. TablePuppet decomposes the learning process into "learning over join" and "learning over union", and pushes computation down to individual tables. It also optimizes computation/communication for duplicate tuples and provides privacy guarantees.

3. It implements TablePuppet using a server-client architecture and three physical operators that unify and abstract the computation/communication for both SGD and ADMM algorithms. This allows applying TablePuppet to these algorithms in a flexible way.

4. It theoretically analyzes the computation/communication complexity of TablePuppet as well as its formal privacy guarantees based on differential privacy. 

5. It empirically evaluates TablePuppet on real-world datasets with multiple machine learning models, showing that it can achieve accuracy comparable to centralized baselines and that the ADMM algorithm atop TablePuppet is more communication-efficient than SGD.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the RFL problem and the TablePuppet framework to address it, with both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation provided.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Relational federated learning (RFL) - The paper proposes and formalizes this new problem of training machine learning models over relational tables across distributed databases. RFL involves joins, unions, and both vertical and horizontal partitioning of data.

- Learning over join (LoJ) - One of the two key steps proposed in the TablePuppet framework to decompose the learning process, which pushes computation down to the individual vertical tables. 

- Learning over union (LoU) - The second key step in TablePuppet which further pushes computation down to the individual horizontal partitions within each vertical table.

- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - One of the two widely used machine learning training algorithms that the TablePuppet framework integrates with and optimizes for the RFL setting.

- Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) - The other common training algorithm that TablePuppet incorporates and optimizes.

- Computation and communication optimization - Key techniques used in TablePuppet to minimize overhead from duplicate tuples introduced in joins and optimize the complexity.

- Differential privacy - Used in TablePuppet to provide formal privacy guarantees for both feature and label data distributed across clients.

So in summary, the key themes have to do with formalizing and addressing this new relational federated learning problem with a framework that leverages SGD and ADMM training algorithms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the table mapping mechanism work to avoid actual joins and unions between tables from different clients? What are the privacy implications of this mapping?

2) The paper mentions optimizing duplicate tuples introduced by joins. What specifically causes these duplicate tuples and how does the method reduce computation and communication overhead associated with them?

3) How exactly does the method decompose and push down the SGD and ADMM algorithms to individual tables? What are the differences in how SGD and ADMM get decomposed? 

4) What are the differences between the learning over join (LoJ) and learning over union (LoU) steps? How do they interact in the overall method?

5) Explain the server-client architecture used for coordination. What are the specific responsibilities of the server vs the clients? 

6) How do the three proposed physical operators (LoJ, LoU, client) work? How do they unify and simplify the implementation of SGD and ADMM?

7) Walk through how privacy is ensured for both features and labels. What mechanisms are used and why are separate mechanisms needed?

8) Analyze the computation vs communication tradeoffs of SGD vs ADMM for both vertical and horizontal partitions. When is each algorithm superior?

9) How does the method handle scenarios with only vertical partitions (RFL-V) vs full relational partitions (RFL)? What gets simplified?

10) What types of learning tasks and models are currently supported? What needs to be done to expand the applicability of the method to other models and algorithms?
