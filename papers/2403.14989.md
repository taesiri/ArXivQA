# [MasonTigers at SemEval-2024 Task 8: Performance Analysis of   Transformer-based Models on Machine-Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14989)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Proliferation of machine-generated text across various domains raises concerns of potential misuse. Hence detecting machine vs human-written text is critical.  
- Prior work has limitations in: binary classification, focus predominantly on English language, considering amalgamation of human-machine texts.
- This motivates the SemEval 2024 shared task on detecting machine-generated texts across multiple generators, domains, and languages. 

Proposed Solution:
- The shared task has 3 subtasks:
  - A. Binary classification of human vs machine text in monolingual and multilingual tracks  
  - B. Multi-way classification to identify source of machine text among 5 generators
  - C. Identifying transition point from human to machine text in mixed texts
- Employed ensemble of transformer models, sentence transformers and statistical ML approaches. 
- Also utilized zero-shot prompting and fine-tuning of FlanT5 model.
- Tuned hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, dropout for effective training.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrated ensemble methods outperform individual models significantly in classification tasks. 
- Achieved accuracies of 74% in subtask A monolingual track and 60% in multilingual track.
- Attained accuracy of 65% in subtask B multi-label classification task.  
- In subtask C, achieved Mean Absolute Error of 60.78 using weighted ensemble.
- Analyzed errors indicating false positives and limitations in distinguishing human vs machine texts.
- Showcased blend of transformers, ML and ensemble strategies to tackle complexities in detecting machine-generated texts.

In summary, the paper addresses key gaps through shared task and systematically handles the problem of machine text detection using state-of-the-art deep learning and ensemble techniques across multiple languages.
