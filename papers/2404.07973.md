# [Ferret-v2: An Improved Baseline for Referring and Grounding with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal LLMs like Ferret have limited visual understanding capabilities due to the low resolution of pre-trained image encoders. This restricts their performance on tasks requiring detailed visual comprehension. 

Proposed Solution - Ferret-v2:
- Implements "any resolution" image scaling to enable handling images at higher resolutions while retaining pre-trained knowledge. This outperforms "direct upsampling".

- Uses both CLIP and DINOv2 encoders to capture global semantics as well as local fine-grained details at multiple visual granularities. 

- Employs a 3-stage training paradigm going from coarse image-text alignment to high-resolution dense alignment and finally instruction tuning.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing "any resolution" image scaling surpasses "direct upsampling" for harnessing detail while preserving pre-training benefits.

- Multi-granularity visual encoding with CLIP and DINOv2 encoders to represent both global and local fine-grained information.

- A novel 3-stage training approach enabling improved resolution handling and vision-language alignment in a "coarse-to-fine" manner.

- State-of-the-art performance over strong baselines like Ferret across referring, grounding and reasoning tasks, especially those needing regional visual understanding.

In summary, Ferret-v2 substantially upgrades Ferret for any resolution processing, multi-granularity encoding and enhanced training to unlock superior detail-oriented visual comprehension.
