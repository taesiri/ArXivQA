# [Detecting Multivariate Time Series Anomalies with Zero Known Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02108)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing methods for multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection rely on having a training dataset containing only normal instances. However, preparing such a "clean" dataset is very difficult in practice. Methods trained on datasets containing anomalies can suffer from performance degradation. Therefore, it is desirable to develop unsupervised MTS anomaly detection methods that do not rely on any labeled data.  

Proposed Solution - MTGFlow:
The authors propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach called MTGFlow that works on datasets with no labels. It is based on the intuition that abnormal instances have lower densities compared to normal instances. MTGFlow has two main components:

1. Dynamic Graph Structure Learning: A self-attention mechanism is used to learn the evolving dependencies between different time series entities over time. This results in a dynamic graph adjacency matrix that captures complex inter-relationships.

2. Entity-aware Normalizing Flow: Each entity's time series is mapped to a unique parameterized distribution to model entity-specific densities, unlike prior work that maps all entities to one distribution. Parameters are shared across entities to limit model size.

By combining dynamic graph learning and entity-aware density estimation, MTGFlow is able to effectively model densities and detect anomalies without any labels.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new state-of-the-art unsupervised MTS anomaly detection method called MTGFlow
- Introduces dynamic graph learning via self-attention to capture evolving inter-dependencies between entities
- Develops an entity-aware normalizing flow to enable fine-grained entity-specific density estimations
- Achieves superior performance over 7 baselines on 5 public datasets, improving AUROC by up to 5%
- Enables localization and interpretation of anomalies via analysis of entity-specific log likelihoods and scores

The paper proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method called MTGFlow for multivariate time series, which does not require any labeled data for training. It models the dynamic dependencies between different time series using graph structure learning based on self-attention. It also uses an entity-aware normalizing flow model to estimate the density of each individual time series to capture their distinct characteristics. The method is evaluated on several public datasets and shown to outperform state-of-the-art approaches. Key capabilities enabled by MTGFlow include anomaly localization to specific time series entities and interpretation of the detected anomalies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that preparing a dataset with all normal instances for training is very laborious. Why is this and what are some of the challenges involved? How does the proposed unsupervised approach help mitigate this?

2. The paper proposes to model the mutual dependencies among entities via a dynamic graph structure. Why is a static graph structure like a DAG insufficient? What properties of the dependencies can a dynamic graph capture that a static one cannot?  

3. The paper argues that entities usually have diverse working mechanisms, leading to diverse anomaly sparse characteristics. Provide some examples illustrating how anomalies might manifest differently across entities. Why is the entity-aware normalizing flow design better able to capture this compared to projecting all entities onto the same distribution?

4. Explain the graph structure learning module via self-attention in detail. In particular, how are the nodes and edges of the graph defined? How do the query/key projections and attention scores quantify the pairwise relationships and dependencies? 

5. Walk through the mathematical formulations behind the normalizing flow-based density estimation. In particular, explain concepts like the change of variable formula, invertible transformations, tractable Jacobian determinants, etc. and how they facilitate the mapping between distributions.

6. The paper proposes a joint optimization scheme for the different modules based on maximum likelihood estimation. Why is this joint optimization beneficial compared to optimizing each module separately? What problems could separate optimization introduce?

7. Analyze the various properties of the learned dynamic graph structure as discussed in the paper (e.g. consistency, periodicity, etc.). What insights do these properties provide about the nature of dependencies among the multivariate time series entities? 

8. The paper demonstrates how log-likelihoods can be used to effectively discern anomalies from normal instances. However, why are the raw anomaly scores themselves not sufficient to set thresholds and labels for anomalies?

9. Discuss the role of the derived spatio-temporal conditions as inputs to the normalizing flow model. Why do these additional conditions, based on temporal correlations and graph structure, enable more accurate density estimation?

10. One of the benefits mentioned is the ability to localize anomalies to specific entities based on entity-level scores. Explain how the methodology facilitates this interpretation and why it is important for understanding detected anomalies.
