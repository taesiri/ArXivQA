# [Detecting Multivariate Time Series Anomalies with Zero Known Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02108)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing methods for multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection rely on having a training dataset containing only normal instances. However, preparing such a "clean" dataset is very difficult in practice. Methods trained on datasets containing anomalies can suffer from performance degradation. Therefore, it is desirable to develop unsupervised MTS anomaly detection methods that do not rely on any labeled data.  

Proposed Solution - MTGFlow:
The authors propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach called MTGFlow that works on datasets with no labels. It is based on the intuition that abnormal instances have lower densities compared to normal instances. MTGFlow has two main components:

1. Dynamic Graph Structure Learning: A self-attention mechanism is used to learn the evolving dependencies between different time series entities over time. This results in a dynamic graph adjacency matrix that captures complex inter-relationships.

2. Entity-aware Normalizing Flow: Each entity's time series is mapped to a unique parameterized distribution to model entity-specific densities, unlike prior work that maps all entities to one distribution. Parameters are shared across entities to limit model size.

By combining dynamic graph learning and entity-aware density estimation, MTGFlow is able to effectively model densities and detect anomalies without any labels.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new state-of-the-art unsupervised MTS anomaly detection method called MTGFlow
- Introduces dynamic graph learning via self-attention to capture evolving inter-dependencies between entities
- Develops an entity-aware normalizing flow to enable fine-grained entity-specific density estimations
- Achieves superior performance over 7 baselines on 5 public datasets, improving AUROC by up to 5%
- Enables localization and interpretation of anomalies via analysis of entity-specific log likelihoods and scores
