# [Referee-Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Locational Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on addressing unfairness and biases in machine learning models with respect to distinct geographic locations (locational fairness). Though fairness issues related to races or genders have been extensively studied, locational fairness has received little attention. Lack of locational fairness in machine learning models can lead to biased resource distribution and infrastructure quality. The authors present two case studies - satellite-based crop monitoring for subsidy distribution, and traffic accident risk estimation for infrastructure investments - to demonstrate potential issues arising from lack of locational fairness. They further explain key challenges in addressing locational fairness including change of location sets from training to testing and limited labeled data.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a locational meta-referee (Meta-Ref) to enforce locational fairness in neural networks for geolocated data. Meta-Ref learns to dynamically adjust learning rates for data samples based on prediction performances and characteristics of locations in each spatial task. A three-phase training framework is presented to update Meta-Ref and the prediction model coordinately on a distribution of spatial tasks. Once trained, Meta-Ref can be applied to a fine-tuned model for new spatial tasks with different locations to promote fairness and adaptation with limited data. 

Key Contributions:
- Proposal of Meta-Ref that oversees few-shot meta-training of prediction models to advocate fairness across locations by modulating learning rates.
- A three-phase training strategy for Meta-Ref and its coupled prediction model using distributions of spatial tasks.
- Demonstrated improved locational fairness from Meta-Ref in two case studies - satellite crop classification and traffic accident estimation, while maintaining prediction performance.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of meta-learning to enable rapid adaptation of locational fairness for predictive models applied to new spatial regions. Experiments confirmed Meta-Ref's effectiveness.
