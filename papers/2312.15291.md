# [Reverse Multi-Choice Dialogue Commonsense Inference with   Graph-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15291)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper tackles the challenging problem of Dialogue Commonsense Multi-choice Question Answering (DC-MCQ). This involves selecting the logical answers from a set of options based on the dialogue history and context.
- While existing methods work well for single-choice questions, they struggle with multi-choice questions due to two key challenges: Option Saturation (uncertainty in the number of correct options) and Clue Labyrinth (intricate hidden clues woven in the questions and options).

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel 3-step framework called Reverse Exclusion Graph-of-Thought (ReX-GoT) that mimics human reasoning for DC-MCQ.
- Step 1: Option Exclusion - Excludes irrational options and provides reasons to narrow down choices.  
- Step 2: Error Analysis - Further analyzes each option using a Graph-of-Thought to uncover more insights.
- Step 3: Combine Information - Combines clues from Step 1 and 2 to pick the optimal reasoning path and final answers.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new technique aligned with human cognition that handles option saturation via reverse exclusion.
- Handles clue labyrinth by designing a Graph-of-Thought to integrate multi-dimensional clues.  
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on CICERO and CICERO_v2 datasets, significantly outperforming prior best methods.
- Provides extensive analyses revealing how ReX-GoT prompts LLMs more effectively than alternatives.

In summary, the paper puts forth an innovative prompt-based technique to address key challenges in complex commonsense multi-choice question answering. By reversing traditional forward reasoning, and structuring an interpretable graph-of-thought, the method attains stronger performance.
