# [Portrait4D-v2: Pseudo Multi-View Data Creates Better 4D Head Synthesizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating photorealistic and animatable 3D head avatars from a single image is an important research problem with many applications in AR/VR and virtual communication. Existing methods rely heavily on 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) for geometry reconstruction, expression manipulation and pose estimation, which restricts them from creating high-fidelity head avatars due to limited accuracy and expressiveness of 3DMM. Lack of large-scale multi-view data due to difficulty in collection also hinders learning a generalizable head model.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose to use pseudo multi-view videos to learn a feed-forward one-shot 4D head synthesizer without relying on 3DMM. They first learn a 3D head synthesizer using synthetic data to convert monocular videos to multi-view ones. Then the pseudo multi-view videos are utilized to perform cross-view self-reenactment for training the 4D synthesizer, where motion embedding is extracted from one view and used to reconstruct the scene at another view. This allows the model to be supervised by real video data and perform expression disentanglement.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel learning paradigm to integrate 3D priors with 2D supervisions using pseudo multi-view videos for better 4D head avatar creation, avoiding heavy reliance on inaccurate 3DMM reconstruction.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction fidelity, geometry consistency and motion control accuracy, largely outperforming previous 3DMM-reliant approaches.  
- Demonstrates superior cross-identity expression and lip synchronization ability compared to methods with good cross-ID performance.
- The learning framework is model-agnostic and can incorporate advanced network architectures.

In summary, the key novelty lies in the proposed learning scheme leveraging pseudo multi-view videos to achieve high-fidelity 4D head synthesis without being restricted by 3DMM limitations. This offers new insights into integrating 3D priors and 2D data for photorealistic avatar modeling.
