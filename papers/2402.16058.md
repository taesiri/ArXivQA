# [Say More with Less: Understanding Prompt Learning Behaviors through Gist   Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16058)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT require lengthy prompts as input context to produce outputs aligned with user intentions. This incurs extra computational costs during inference.
- Existing methods for prompt compression have limitations in interpretation, refinement, and generalization across tasks and models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Gist-COCO, a novel prompt compression approach using gist conditioned decoding. 
- It employs an additional encoder to compress prompts into gist token representations. These gist tokens emulate the information from raw prompts when decoded by the original LLM decoder.
- Gist-COCO disentangles gist tokens for passage and instruction compression. It also verbalizes gist tokens into gist prompts to generalize across models.

Key Contributions:
- Gist-COCO outperforms prior prompt compression techniques on passage and instruction compression tasks.
- The gist verbalization method extends Gist-COCO's effectiveness to different decoder LMs with high compression rates. 
- Analysis of gist prompts provides insights into their diverse roles in assisting LMs - providing answers directly, generating chain of thought, or repeating input content.
- Case studies demonstrate Gist-COCO's ability to extract essential information from prompts to aid LMs in comprehension and generation.

In summary, Gist-COCO enables improved prompt compression with better interpretation, refinement and generalization for guiding large language models. The verbalization method and analysis also further understanding of how prompts assist LMs.
