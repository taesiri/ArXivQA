# [An investigation of belief-free DRL and MCTS for inspection and   maintenance planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14824)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of optimal inspection and maintenance (I&M) planning for civil infrastructure systems. I&M planning is a sequential decision making problem under uncertainty with large uncertainties and many possible strategies over time. Current practice uses simple heuristics but there is potential for more optimal planning using the available information. The paper investigates using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) neural networks and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for I&M planning without needing an explicit system model.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a tailored DRL neural network architecture called the Action-specific Deep Dueling Recurrent Q-network (+RQN) that works directly with observations over time rather than belief states. It combines ideas from prior DRL architectures. The paper also investigates using MCTS for the I&M planning problem. These methods are compared on an example problem of maintenance planning for a single deteriorating component with 4 possible actions.

Contributions:
1) Proposes the +RQN architecture for DRL on I&M problems that works with observations rather than belief states
2) Compares performance of +RQN and MCTS on an I&M example problem to optimal solution
3) Finds the +RQN performs better overall than MCTS. MCTS works decently for low observation errors.
4) Compares resulting policies statistically and in belief space - highlights stochasticity of policies
5) Discusses advantages/disadvantages of both methods and opportunities for enhancement

Overall, the paper makes contributions in proposing and evaluating a belief-free DRL architecture for I&M planning, and also in providing one of the first comparisons of DRL and MCTS in this application area. The results provide guidance on preferable methods and opportunities for improvement.
