# [Visibility-Aware Keypoint Localization for 6DoF Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14559)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing keypoint-based methods for 6DoF object pose estimation have a common issue - they try to localize all the predefined keypoints even if many of them are invisible due to occlusions or self-occlusions. Localizing invisible keypoints is challenging and degrades the quality of 3D-2D correspondences used for pose estimation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a visibility-aware keypoint localization method to establish reliable correspondences. The key ideas are:

1) Efficiently generate binary keypoint visibility labels from object-level annotations, for both asymmetric and symmetric objects. The visibility is decomposed into external visibility (wrt occlusions) and internal visibility (wrt self-occlusions).

2) Derive real-valued, visibility-aware importance for each keypoint using Personalized PageRank on the keypoint nearest neighbor graph. Keypoints are ranked based on proximity to visible keypoints.  

3) Integrate visibility-aware importance into existing keypoint-based pose estimator. Add modules to predict visibility and importance. Select subsets of keypoints with high importance for localization.

Main Contributions:

- Propose to focus on localizing visible and important keypoints instead of all predefined ones
- Efficient way to generate keypoint visibility labels from object annotations 
- Visibility-aware importance measure based on PageRank  
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by incorporating visibility-aware importance into existing method

The proposed visibility-aware method effectively eliminates unreliable keypoints, resulting in higher quality correspondences and more accurate 6DoF pose estimates, especially in cases with heavy occlusions.
