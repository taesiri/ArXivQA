# [Only the Curve Shape Matters: Training Foundation Models for Zero-Shot   Multivariate Time Series Forecasting through Next Curve Shape Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time series forecasting is important for many applications but most existing methods require training on the target datasets. Large pretrained foundation models have shown success for zero-shot transfer in NLP/CV but not yet for time series. 
- Challenges include handling varying numbers of input variables across datasets and differences in value ranges/distributions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new framework that converts any multivariate time series into a sequence of fixed-size "curve shape" patches on a per-channel basis. Each patch covers 64 timesteps per channel.
- Introduce General Time Transformer (GTT), a Transformer encoder model pretrained to predict the next curve shape patch based on past context patches in a channel-wise manner.
- GTT incorporates temporal attention to model timeseries structure and cross-channel attention to capture dependencies between input variables.
- For inference, GTT employs reversible normalization and zero padding so no input preprocessing is needed.

Main Contributions:
- First demonstration of strong zero-shot multivariate time series forecasting using a pretrained foundation model. 
- Novel framework to represent diverse timeseries datasets via channel-wise curve shape patches enabling pretrained modeling.
- Analysis of GTT model variants reveals scaling improvements with wider/deeper architectures and larger pretraining datasets.
- Extensive empirical evaluation shows GTT outperforms recent supervised baselines and time series foundation models in zero-shot and fine-tuned forecasting.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective methodology for pretraining foundation models on large time series datasets for zero-shot transfer learning, overcoming key challenges compared to NLP/CV. Impressive forecasting accuracy is demonstrated, showing promise for this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Transformer-based foundation model called General Time Transformer (GTT) that is pretrained on a large and diverse dataset of 200 million time series samples to achieve strong zero-shot multivariate time series forecasting performance by formulating the task as next curve shape prediction on a per-channel basis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces a framework that formulates the task of cross-domain multivariate time series forecasting into a problem of predicting the next curve shape given a context window of past curve shapes in a unified numerical magnitude. This framework lays a foundation for developing large-scale foundation models for multivariate time series forecasting. 

2. The experimental results demonstrate that foundation models for time series forecasting, trained on datasets comparable in size to those used in computer vision and natural language processing domains, can achieve outstanding zero-shot forecasting capabilities. 

3. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed General Time Transformer (GTT) is the first foundation model designed specifically for zero-shot multivariate time series forecasting.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel framework and model architecture (GTT) for training large-scale foundation models to achieve strong zero-shot multivariate time series forecasting performance by leveraging large and diverse training datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper formulates multivariate time series forecasting as a channel-wise next curve shape prediction problem. Why is this an effective way to handle varying channel dimensions across different time series datasets? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

2. The paper employs an encoder-only architecture for the proposed GTT model. What is the rationale behind using an encoder-only instead of a decoder-only architecture? What challenges would arise with using a decoder-only architecture?

3. The temporal and channel attention in GTT share the same weights for parameter efficiency. Does weight sharing limit the model's ability to specialize the different attentions? How could the attentions be modified to have separate weights while retaining efficiency?  

4. How does the reversible instance normalization (RevIN) used during inference eliminate the need for input normalization and improve model usage convenience? What tradeoffs are being made by not using RevIN during training?

5. The loss function only calculates error on originally existing data points. Why is this done and how does it prevent bias towards samples with larger values? What potential downsides could this introduce?

6. How does the channel attention mechanism in GTT capture cross-variate dependencies? Can you suggest any modifications or alternatives to this approach? 

7. The paper demonstrates GTT exhibits excellent zero-shot capabilities. However, how could the model be enhanced to provide meaningful uncertainty estimates along with its forecasts?

8. What architectural changes could extend GTT's context length to improve long-term forecasting performance? What challenges would this introduce?

9. The scaling experiments show larger parameters and training data improve performance. However, what problems could occur from blindly scaling up the model and training process? 

10. The paper focuses on forecasting accuracy. However, what other objectives could GTT be optimized for during pretraining, such as training efficiency, model robustness, or calibration?
