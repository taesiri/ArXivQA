## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of finding periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems in the convex case, by considering the boundary value problem of finding $T$-periodic solutions x(t) that satisfy the Hamiltonian system dynamics $\dot{x}=JH'(t,x)$ where $H$ is a convex Hamiltonian function. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using a duality approach to reformulate the problem as minimizing a dual action functional $\psi(u)$ whose critical points yield periodic solutions. Sufficient conditions involving the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are given under which the minimizer $\bar{u}$ is guaranteed to be non-trivial and non-constant, yielding a non-constant periodic solution.

Main Contributions:
- Gives a dual formulation for finding periodic solutions to convex Hamiltonian systems by minimizing an action functional 
- Provides sufficient conditions on the Hamiltonian involving eigenvalue estimates under which the minimizer is non-constant
- Proves that under some assumptions, local minimizers have minimal period $T$
- Discusses applications to subharmonic solutions and forced Hamiltonian systems

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing a dual action minimization approach to find non-trivial periodic solutions to convex Hamiltonians, along with eigenvalue conditions for non-triviality and results on the periodicity of minimizers. The duality approach enables tackling more general classes of Hamiltonians.
