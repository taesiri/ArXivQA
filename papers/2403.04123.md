# [Exploring LLM-based Agents for Root Cause Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04123)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Root cause analysis (RCA) is a critical and demanding part of cloud incident management. It requires deep domain knowledge and extensive experience. 
- Prior AI approaches for automated RCA rely solely on the incident title/description and cannot dynamically collect additional diagnostic data like human engineers.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a Large Language Model (LLM) based agent called ReAct that can reason, plan, and interact with tools to collect new diagnostic information.
- Equip ReAct with generalized tools like retrieval over historical incidents and QA over raw incident descriptions.
- Also evaluate ReAct when given access to team-specific tools like knowledge bases and monitoring services.

Contributions:
- First empirical study of LLM agents for RCA on a static out-of-distribution dataset of real production incidents.
- Show ReAct is competitive on semantic similarity metrics while having higher factual accuracy than retrieval and chain-of-thought baselines.
- Adding discussion comments to incidents does not significantly improve performance.
- Case study of implementing ReAct for a team demonstrates potential to autonomously perform RCA when given proper tools.
- Highlight considerations like the need for multi-trial workflows, experiential learning mechanisms, and human-in-the-loop features for practical RCA agents.

In summary, this paper explores using LLM agents like ReAct for automated RCA, establishes strong initial results on a static dataset, and through a case study demonstrates the potential as well as practical challenges in developing real-world RCA agent systems.
