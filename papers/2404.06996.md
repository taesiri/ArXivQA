# [XNLIeu: a dataset for cross-lingual NLI in Basque](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06996)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cross-lingual NLI is important for evaluating cross-lingual NLU capabilities, but datasets are lacking for low-resource languages like Basque. 
- Existing NLI datasets contain biases and artifacts that allow models to rely on superficial patterns rather than deep understanding.
- The choice of source language and mismatch between origin of train/test data impacts cross-lingual transfer learning.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop XNLIeu, an expansion of the XNLI benchmark to Basque, by machine translating and post-editing the English XNLI.
- Create XNLIeu_MT (machine translated only) and a small Native Basque dataset without biases.  
- Conduct experiments with various mono- and multilingual models using zero-shot transfer, translate-train, and zero-shot prompting strategies.

Main Contributions:
- Release of XNLIeu, XNLIeu_MT and Native Basque NLI datasets.
- New cross-lingual NLI baselines for Basque using multiple models and strategies. 
- Analysis showing post-edition is crucial for reliable NLI evaluation.
- Translate-train is most effective but gains are smaller on Native set.
- Source language choice and train/test mismatch impacts results.

The paper introduces the first NLI dataset for Basque to facilitate research on Basque NLU. Through extensive experiments, it provides an analysis of machine translation quality, datasets biases, train/test mismatches, and source language choice on cross-lingual transfer learning for this semantically-complex task.
