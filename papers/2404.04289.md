# [Designing for Human-Agent Alignment: Understanding what humans want from   their agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04289)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in AI enable building autonomous agents that can perform tasks on a human's behalf. However, there is a need to better understand what information and alignment is needed between the human and agent for the agent to perform well. 

- This paper examines the research question: "What are the most important constituents to Human-Agent alignment, as perceived by the human collaborator?"

Methodology:
- The authors conducted a qualitative study with 10 participants using a think-aloud protocol. 

- Participants were presented with scenarios where an autonomous sales agent they owned performed poorly during an online camera sale negotiation. 

- Participants were asked to provide feedback on how the situations could have been better handled.

Key Findings:
- Analysis revealed 6 key dimensions for human-agent alignment:

    1. Knowledge Schema Alignment: Agent needs to understand and gather necessary info about the item and transaction.

    2. Autonomy/Agency Alignment: Agreeing on boundaries for autonomous decisions vs. situations requiring human input.

    3. Operational Alignment: Agreeing on preferred negotiation strategies.

    4. Reputational Alignment: Considering impact of agent's actions on human's reputation. 

    5. Ethics Alignment: Aligning on ethical behavior.

    6. Human Engagement Alignment: When and how the agent should interact with the human.

- There was diversity among participants on alignment needs, highlighting need for customization.

- Participants cannot anticipate all scenarios, so agents should help humans discover possibilities.

Implications:
- Human-agent alignment is an ongoing, longitudinal process requiring multiple types of alignment.

- Misalignment can negatively impact human in terms of reputation, ethics.

- Agents can serve as "alignment leaders" by surfacing issues and options to humans.

In summary, this paper provides an empirical understanding of key considerations in designing interfaces for autonomous agents to enable successful human-AI collaboration.
