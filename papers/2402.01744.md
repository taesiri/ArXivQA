# [Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Graph Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Drug discovery is a long and costly process with multiple steps. Virtual screening (VS) using machine learning can help prioritize active drug compounds and speed up the process. 
- However, most VS methods don't provide interpretable explanations about why a compound is predicted to be active. This limits the ability to optimize hit compounds into leads.
- Explainability is needed to understand the key molecular moieties involved in bioactivity prediction.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a graph neural network (GNN) classifier for 20 kinase targets, using graph representation of molecules that encodes chemical information in atoms and bonds.
- GNN with graph convolutions achieves over 98% F1 score on average for multi-target classification.
- For explainability, devise a hierarchical gradient-based explainer inspired by Grad-CAM to highlight contributions of atoms, rings, and moieties.
- Train a high-sensitivity binary GNN classifier focused only on CDK1 to avoid multi-target bias.
- Apply explainer hierarchy to catch information at atom, ring, and molecule levels using message passing in GNN.

Key Contributions:
- State-of-the-art GNN for 20-target virtual screening with over 90% sensitivity.
- Hierarchical visual explainer that identifies key molecular moieties involved in activity prediction.
- Validation on 19 CDK1 inhibitors shows explainer results match expert analysis and docking studies for 17 drugs.
- Helps understand chemical features important for binding, to guide hit-to-lead optimization.
- Combines multiple levels of graph embeddings to explain prediction from atoms to whole molecule.

In summary, the paper presents an interpretable GNN-based virtual screening approach to predict and explain bioactivity using hierarchical graphs, enabling better understanding and optimization of hit compounds. The explainer identifies crucial binding moieties consistent with expert analysis. This can accelerate early-stage drug discovery.
