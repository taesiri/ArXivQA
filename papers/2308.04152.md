# [Fine-tuning Multimodal LLMs to Follow Zero-shot Demonstrative   Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04152)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can vision-language models be empowered to follow more complex interleaved vision-language instructions that involve multiple interrelated images and text? 

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) Existing vision-language models struggle with instructions involving interleaved image-text sequences because their visual prompt generators are mainly trained on image-caption alignment, which focuses on extracting common foreground information for captioning. This results in failure to extract specific visual information needed for particular tasks.

2) A controllable knowledge re-injection module can be added to selectively direct the visual prompt generator to extract missing task-specific visual information based on instruction semantics provided by the language model. This allows complementing the language model with the visual knowledge needed to understand complex instructions.

3) The controllable re-injection module can be efficiently trained without massive instruction-following data by using a proposed cross-attention guided counterfactual image training strategy.

In summary, the central research question is how to empower vision-language models to handle more complex multi-modal instructions, with hypotheses about adding controllable re-injection of visual knowledge and efficiently training this with counterfactual images rather than large instruction datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing I4, a new benchmark for evaluating interleaved vision-language instruction following. I4 contains 31 diverse tasks formatted in a unified instruction-response style, covering a wide range of practical scenarios like cartoons, textbooks, webpages, etc. 

2. Through evaluation on I4, identifying a key limitation of current multimodal language models - their visual prompt generators tend to focus on common foreground objects and struggle to extract specific visual information needed for particular tasks.

3. Proposing a lightweight Controllable Knowledge Re-Injection (CLORI) module that allows the language model to conditionally control the visual prompt generator to extract missing task-specific visual information and inject it back into the language model.

4. Introducing a Cross-Attention Guided Counterfactual Image Training (CAGIT) strategy to efficiently learn the CLORI module without needing large volumes of instruction tuning data.

5. Achieving state-of-the-art results on the challenging I4 benchmark using Cheetor, a Transformer-based multimodal language model enhanced with the proposed CLORI module and CAGIT training. Cheetor outperforms prior methods substantially, using only 30k images for training.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the new I4 benchmark, the identification of limitations of current models, and the lightweight CLORI module along with the efficient CAGIT training strategy to address these limitations and achieve much improved instruction following performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark and method to improve the ability of vision-language models to follow complex instructions involving multiple interrelated images and text, by re-injecting missing visual information conditional on the instruction semantics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here is how I see this paper comparing to other research in the same field:

The paper presents a new benchmark called I4 for evaluating vision-language models on their ability to follow interleaved image-text instructions. This is an important contribution as most prior work has focused on simpler instructions with just a single image, which limits real-world applicability. Creating a benchmark to systematically measure performance on more complex and diverse instructions is valuable for driving progress.

The paper also identifies limitations of current models in handling such instructions, revealing they struggle to extract all required visual information and lack multi-image reasoning skills. Proposing the controllable knowledge re-injection module and counterfactual training strategy to address this key weakness is novel compared to prior work that mainly aims to collect more training data. The solutions are model-agnostic and enable extracting missing knowledge without expensive full fine-tuning.

The extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the challenging I4 benchmark without relying on large-scale multi-modal tuning data like some other methods. Competitive results on the MME benchmark also showcase generalization ability. Overall, the work makes important contributions in benchmarking, analysis to reveal model deficiencies, and efficient training solutions.

Some aspects that relate to other research include:
- The model architecture builds on recent vision-language models like BLIP and Flamingo.
- The conditional prompting idea is inspired by prompt-based tuning techniques.
- Counterfactual training has connections to other data augmentation and self-training strategies.

In summary, the paper pushes forward the frontier in vision-language instruction following through a new challenging benchmark, insights into model limitations, and innovative training solutions that do not require massive tuning data. The analysis and techniques meaningfully advance the field beyond previous work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more sophisticated controllable knowledge re-injection mechanisms that allow finer-grained control over the visual prompt generator. The authors propose a simple method to conditionally control the visual prompt generator, but suggest more advanced techniques could be explored.

- Expanding the cross-attention guided counterfactual image training strategy to generate more diverse and high-quality training data. The authors show this is an effective technique for training the controllable re-injection module, but suggest enhancements like involving language models in the counterfactual image generation process.

- Applying the controllable re-injection approach to other modalities beyond vision, such as audio, to handle instructions with diverse multimodal contexts. 

- Scaling up the model size and training data to further improve performance on complex interleaved multimodal instructions. The authors demonstrate promising results with a 7B parameter model, but larger models trained on more data could potentially achieve even better performance.

- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of real-world applications and scenarios beyond the benchmarks used in the paper. The authors propose a new challenging benchmark, but evaluating on real use cases is an important future direction.

- Combining the controllable re-injection module with other techniques like prompt-based tuning to further improve the adaptability of models to new tasks and instructions.

In summary, the key future directions focus on developing more advanced controllable re-injection mechanisms, generating better training data, expanding to other modalities and tasks, scaling up model size and data, and evaluating on real-world applications. The authors propose an intriguing approach in this paper, but suggest many promising avenues for extending it in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called I4 for evaluating instruction following abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on complex interleaved vision-language instructions. I4 contains 31 diverse tasks covering 20 scenarios with interleaved sequences of images and text as instructions. Experiments on I4 reveal limitations of existing MLLMs, where the visual prompt generator fails to extract specific visual information needed for the task and instead focuses on generic image captioning. To address this, the authors propose a lightweight controllable knowledge re-injection (CLORI) module that leverages the language model's reasoning to control the visual prompt generator to extract missing task-specific visual information. They also introduce an efficient cross-attention guided counterfactual image training strategy to learn CLORI without needing multi-modal instruction data. Their model Cheetor outperforms prior MLLMs on I4 without expensive tuning, demonstrating the benefits of controllably re-injecting visual knowledge. The benchmark and model aim to facilitate research on MLLMs that can follow real-world complex interleaved instructions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes I4, a new benchmark for evaluating the ability of vision-language models to follow interleaved image-text instructions. The benchmark contains 31 diverse tasks formatted as image-text sequences, covering a wide range of real-world scenarios like textbooks, webpages, and conversations. The key properties of the benchmark are: 1) Interleaved image-text context, with multiple inter-related images and texts as input; 2) Complex instructions, ranging from completing dialogues to answering questions based on materials; and 3) Diverse scenarios like cartoons, recipes, and more. 

The authors systematically evaluate recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on I4 and find they struggle on such complex instructions. They argue the visual prompt generator in MLLMs is the core issue, as existing methods train it on simple image captions, so it fails to extract specific visual information needed for particular tasks. To address this, they propose a lightweight module to re-inject missing visual knowledge into the language model, controlled by the language model's own reasoning about the instruction. They also introduce a method to train this module without needing additional data. Their model Cheetor outperforms prior MLLMs on I4 without expensive tuning, demonstrating the value of diagnosing and improving visual prompt generation for complex instructions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight Controllable Knowledge Re-Injection (CLORI) module to improve the ability of multimodal vision-language models to understand complex interleaved image-text instructions. The module first uses a pre-trained visual prompt generator (VPG) to extract basic visual features from the images. It then derives instruction-specific conditions from the language model and uses these conditions to control the VPG to re-extract visual information that is specifically relevant to the task instruction. This additional visual knowledge is re-injected into the language model to complement its understanding. To train the CLORI module efficiently without needing large amounts of labeled data, the paper introduces a Cross-Attention Guided Counterfactual Image Training (CAGIT) strategy. This automatically generates counterfactual training data by identifying ignored visual areas using the VPG's attention maps, editing those areas based on natural language descriptions, and formulating a pre-training task to describe the differences between original and edited images. Overall, the lightweight CLORI module trained with CAGIT enhances multimodal language models by giving them control over extracting instruction-specific visual knowledge.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem the authors are addressing is the limitation of existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in comprehending demonstrative instructions. 

In particular, the paper points out that MLLMs to date have relied on visual prompt generators (VPGs) that are trained on large amounts of image-caption pairs. This results in an inductive bias where the VPG focuses only on extracting the primary visual content from an image, which is sufficient for generating a descriptive caption. 

However, this approach causes MLLMs to struggle with demonstrative instructions, which require a deeper understanding of visual details and their relationships beyond just the primary subject matter. Demonstrative instructions contain multiple interleaved images and text that must be understood in conjunction to follow the overall instruction.

To overcome this key limitation, the authors propose a new visual prompt generator module called VPG-C that can infer and fill in missing visual details that are important for comprehending the full context of demonstrative instructions. They also introduce a synthetic training procedure to tune VPG-C without needing expensive demonstrative instruction datasets.

The paper validates these contributions through a new comprehensive benchmark called DEMON for evaluating demonstrative instruction understanding across diverse tasks and scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that their proposed VPG-C module significantly improves MLLM performance on following demonstrative instructions in a zero-shot manner.

In summary, the key problem is enhancing MLLMs to handle demonstrative instructions better by improving how visual details are prompted to the language model in a way that goes beyond just extracting primary content. The authors address this through an efficient module and training approach.
