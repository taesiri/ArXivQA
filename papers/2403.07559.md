# [Ensembling Prioritized Hybrid Policies for Multi-agent Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07559)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem, which involves navigating multiple agents from their start locations to goal locations in a shared environment without collisions. MAPF has many real-world applications but is computationally challenging, especially as the number of agents increases. Prior methods struggle with scalability, solution quality, and generalizability across environments.

Proposed Solution - Ensembling Prioritized Hybrid Policies (EPH):
The paper proposes EPH, a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to MAPF that employs an enhanced selective communication scheme for agent coordination and several inference-time strategies for improved performance:

1) Hybrid expert guidance: Leverages optimal single-agent A* paths to guide agents when no other agents are nearby. Considers other agents as obstacles in A* calculation.

2) Value-based priority decisions: Resolves conflicts by prioritizing agents based on Q-values from the learned model. Also uses an advanced escape policy based on priorities to avoid deadlocks.  

3) Ensembling: Runs multiple solvers with different settings in parallel and samples the best solution, leveraging complementary strengths.

The model itself is trained with deep Q-learning and an improved communication block inspired by recent Transformer architectures.

Main Contributions:
- Novel selective communication scheme for agent coordination
- Inference-time hybridization and priority techniques  
- Demonstration of strong performance against state-of-the-art methods across random and complex structured maps
- Ensembling approach that efficiently navigates solution spaces

The proposed EPH method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing MARL and search-based MAPF solvers, especially as the number of agents increases, showcasing scalability. The use of local communication and inference-time strategies also makes EPH adaptable and practical for real-world deployment.
