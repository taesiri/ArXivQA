## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Computing leverage scores exactly for large matrices is computationally expensive. Existing approximate methods have limitations in terms of computational complexity or accuracy. Efficient and accurate estimation of leverage scores is needed for many applications like outlier detection, dimensionality reduction, model interpretability, and recommendation systems.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new algorithm called SALSA (Sequential Approximate Leverage Score Algorithm) for efficiently estimating leverage scores of large matrices. 

Key ideas:
- Present a recursive formula to compute exact leverage scores by sequentially adding one column at a time to the matrix.
- Introduce randomized sketching techniques at two stages to get an approximate recursion:
   1) When solving the OLS problem to compute coefficients.
   2) When performing matrix-vector multiplications to compute residuals.
- Provide a high probability relative error bound on the accuracy of SALSA's approximations.
- Apply SALSA to develop an efficient algorithm called LSARMA for fitting ARMA time series models on large datasets.

Main Contributions:
- SALSA estimates leverage scores within a $(1+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon))$ relative error bound and runs in $O(mn(s_1^2+s_2))$ time where $s_1,s_2$ are sketch sizes much smaller than original matrix dimensions $m,n$.
- LSARMA uses SALSA to fit ARMA models with complexity better than state-of-the-art methods, while still finding ML estimates.
- Numerical experiments on large synthetic and real-world matrices demonstrate efficiency and accuracy of proposed methods. For a $20M \times 300$ matrix, SALSA is 19x faster than exact methods with <6% error.
- Algorithm's ability to run on small devices enhances accessibility of time series analysis.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in efficient large matrix computations and big time series analysis via innovative randomized sketching techniques.
