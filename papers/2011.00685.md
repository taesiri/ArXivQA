# [Fast Biconnectivity Restoration in Multi-Robot Systems for Robust   Communication Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00685)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the Fast Biconnectivity Restoration (FBR) problem in multi-robot systems. Specifically, given an initially connected network of robots, the goal is to efficiently repair and restore biconnectivity of the network when robot failures occur. A biconnected network means any single robot failure will not disconnect the network. Efficiently restoring biconnectivity after failures is crucial for the robustness and resilience of multi-robot systems performing cooperative tasks.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes both optimal and approximation algorithms to solve the FBR problem by minimizing the maximum movement of any robot during the restoration:

1. A Quadratically Constrained Program (QCP) is formulated to optimally solve FBR but has high complexity. 

2. A two-phase approximation method is proposed: the Graph Topology Optimization (GTO) phase selects minimum cost edges to augment the connectivity, and the Movement Minimization (MM) phase efficiently moves robots to realize the augmented edges found by GTO.

3. For GTO, an Edge Augmentation (EA) algorithm is proposed to select augmentation edges by constructing a minimum bottleneck spanning arborescence on an associated directed graph. 

4. For MM, a Sequential Cascaded Relocation (SCR) algorithm is proposed to realize augmentation edges by iteratively relocating robots, as well as an optimal QCP formulation.

Main Contributions:

- First QCP formulation to optimally solve the FBR problem
- Approximation algorithms EA-SCR and EA-OPT that significantly improve over state-of-the-art solutions
- Extensive experiments validating the proposed algorithms against existing methods
- Case study demonstrating the applicability of proposed methods in a persistent monitoring task with robots

The key novelty is in formulating the FBR problem specifically to minimize maximum robot movement, as well as developing both optimal and efficient approximation algorithms towards this objective outperforming existing methods. The proposals provably improve resilience to failures in multi-robot systems by restoring biconnectivity.
