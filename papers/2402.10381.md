# [UMAIR-FPS: User-aware Multi-modal Animation Illustration Recommendation   Fusion with Painting Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10381)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recommending relevant anime illustrations to users from a large collection is challenging. Existing recommendation systems focus mainly on text features of items but need to also incorporate image features. Most multi-modal recommendation research is constrained to tightly coupled datasets, limiting applicability to anime illustrations.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes UMAIR-FPS, a user-aware multi-modal animation illustration recommendation fusion method with painting style. It has innovations in feature extraction and multi-modal fusion:

1) Feature Extraction:
- Image Features: A dual-output image encoder is proposed to extract semantic features and artistic style features to enhance representation.

- Text Features: A multi-perspective text dataset with domain knowledge is constructed to fine-tune sentence transformers to adapt it to the anime domain.

2) Multi-Modal Fusion: 
- A user-aware contribution measurement mechanism weights multi-modal features dynamically based on user features.  

- Cross-modal relationships are captured via feature crosses using DCN-V2 module.

Main Contributions:
- First study on illustration multi-modal recommendation systems
- Introduction of dual-output image encoder for jointly modeling semantic and style image features
- Concept of multi-perspective domain text dataset to specialize text encoders  
- User-aware dynamic weighting of multi-modal features
- Incorporation of feature crosses from general recommendation systems into multi-modal fusion

The proposed UMAIR-FPS method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. The ablation studies demonstrate the impact of the different components of the solution.
