# [The Adaptive Workplace: Orchestrating Architectural Services around the   Wellbeing of Individual Occupants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16595)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Open-plan offices are now common, but lead to worker dissatisfaction and negative impacts on health, wellbeing, productivity due to issues like noise, lack of privacy and control.  
- Existing adaptive workplace technologies (e.g. lighting, HVAC, furnishings) fail to adequately address these issues because they:
  - Operate based on averages, not individual needs that change 
  - Don't consider interplay of multiple negative factors
  - Are manual/awkward to control or autonomous without user input
  - Focus on comfort optimization, not health/wellbeing

Proposed Solution - "Adaptive Workplace":
- Continuously adapt the workplace to individuals' changing needs rather than vice versa 
- Use "multi-layered" adaptations across building systems (skin, spaces, stuff)
- Adapt based on "situations" - combinations of conditions, activities, preferences
- "Orchestrate" adaptations across layers to synergistically improve wellbeing 
- Distribute adaptations "equitably" to prioritize those most in need

Key Contributions:
- Grand vision for workplace that adapts itself around individuals 
- Multi-layered, contextual and coordinated approach to adaptations
- Focus on equitable distribution and improving wellbeing, not just comfort  
- Outlines research agenda spanning:
  - Benchmarking impact of adaptations 
  - Inventing new modular/flexible adaptive technologies
  - Developing adaptive control interfaces 
  - Simulating/optimizing adaptation orchestration

In summary, the paper argues open-plan offices require a holistic, contextual and coordinated approach to adaptive technologies focused on individual wellbeing rather than averages and comfort. It provides a high-level vision and research agenda for achieving the "Adaptive Workplace".
