## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Traditional methods for condition monitoring of engineering systems rely on physics-based models or statistical analysis. However, these approaches face challenges in dealing with complex systems and limited availability of accurate physical models. Recently, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising approach that combines physics-based modeling with data-driven machine learning to address these limitations. However, there is a need to comprehensively review PIML techniques for condition monitoring and understand the core methodologies by which physical knowledge is integrated with machine learning models.

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of PIML methods for condition monitoring. It explores various techniques to incorporate physical laws and constraints into machine learning algorithms, enabling them to learn from data while remaining consistent with domain knowledge. Four main integration frameworks are identified and reviewed in detail:

1. Physics Embedded in Feature Space: Augmenting the feature space of ML models with synthetic or physics-based features. Also, transfer learning to capture physics-based representations.

2. Data-Enhanced Refinement of Physical Models: Using ML models to complement physics-based model predictions and account for inaccuracies. 

3. Physics-Informed Regularization: Incorporating physical constraints into the loss function to guide learning towards physically consistent solutions.

4. Physics-Guided Architecture Design: Designing specialized neural network architectures that encode physical relevance within nodes, layers or connections.

For each framework, real-world applications in condition monitoring are discussed and analyzed regarding computational efficiency, model interpretability and generalization capability. Case studies demonstrate the versatility of PIML for tasks like early fault detection, redundancy, and explainability.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive overview of how physical knowledge is integrated with machine learning for condition monitoring.
- Detailed examination of the four main PIML frameworks regarding methodology, advantages, limitations and suitability for condition monitoring tasks.
- Exploration of case studies and works of literature showcasing PIML techniques across various engineering domains.  
- Identification of promising research directions by analyzing trends and discussing outstanding challenges regarding accuracy, computational demands, and generalization.

By reviewing principles and techniques underlying PIML for condition monitoring, this paper establishes key theoretical foundations and serves as a guide for future research and practical deployments of PIML methods.
