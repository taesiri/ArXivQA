# [Curry-DPO: Enhancing Alignment using Curriculum Learning &amp; Ranked   Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07230)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective technique to align large language models (LLMs) to human preferences using pairwise preference data. 
- However, DPO is limited to using only a single pair of responses (one chosen and one rejected) per prompt. 
- In practice, there could be multiple high-quality responses per prompt that could be utilized to create multiple preference pairs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Curri-MultiPair DPO that incorporates curriculum learning on multiple preference pairs into the DPO training framework.  
- Multiple responses per prompt are sampled and rated (e.g. by humans or a judge LLM).
- Multiple preference pairs are created with the highest rated response as the chosen and lower rated responses as the rejected.
- Pairs are ranked from easy to hard based on the difference in ratings.
- Iterative DPO training is done going from easy to hard pairs over epochs, with each iteration using the model from the previous iteration as the reference model.

Main Contributions:
- First work to apply curriculum learning to direct preference optimization.
- Systematic methodology provided to sample, rank and iteratively train on multiple preference pairs.
- Strong empirical gains over standard DPO demonstrated on multiple benchmarks like MT-Bench, Vicuna and WizardLM.
- Detailed ablation studies highlighting the impact of key components like iterative training and reference model selection.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective technique called Curri-MultiPair DPO that trains LLMs on multiple ranked preference pairs in a curriculum learning setup to achieve better alignment on safety and quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Curri-MultiPair DPO, a technique to enhance the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method for aligning large language models by systematically curating and presenting multiple preference response pairs per prompt in order of increasing difficulty via curriculum learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Curri-MultiPair DPO, a method that enhances the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences. Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:

1) Utilizing multiple preference pairs per prompt by sampling multiple responses and creating pairs between the top rated response and lower rated responses. This acts as a form of data augmentation for the DPO method. 

2) Incorporating curriculum learning on the multiple preference pairs by ordering them from "easy" to "hard" and presenting them sequentially to the LLM during training. The easiness is determined by the difference in ratings between the chosen and rejected response in each pair.

3) Updating the reference model used in DPO to be the model from the previous iteration rather than always the original supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model.

The proposed Curri-MultiPair DPO method is shown through experiments to outperform vanilla DPO as well as other baselines on metrics like safety, helpfulness and scores on standard test sets like MT-Bench, Vicuna and WizardLM. The key novelty is in creatively enhancing DPO training with ideas like curriculum learning that have shown success in other domains.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Curriculum learning - The paper proposes incorporating curriculum learning on multiple preference pairs into the DPO training framework. This involves arranging the preference pairs from easy to hard during training.

- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) - The paper focuses on improving the DPO method by using multiple preference pairs in a curriculum learning setup. DPO is a technique to align language models directly on offline pairwise preference data.

- Multiple preference pairs - The paper utilizes multiple high-quality responses that can exist per prompt to create multiple preference pairs per prompt for DPO training. 

- Pairwise preference optimization - The core focus is improving pairwise preference optimization by using multiple preference pairs in conjunction with curriculum learning.

- Curri-DPO - The proposed curriculum learning based DPO approach that uses multiple ranked preference pairs, referred to as Curri-DPO in the paper.

- Iterative training - An important component of Curri-DPO is iterative DPO training on ordered preference pairs, updating the reference model each time.

- Helpfulness, safety evaluation - Curri-DPO is analyzed on metrics like safety and helpfulness compared to baseline DPO.

So in summary, the key terms cover: curriculum learning, direct preference optimization, multiple preference pairs, iterative training, helpfulness and safety evaluation of the proposed Curri-DPO approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Curri-MultiPair DPO emulate curriculum learning to present multiple preference pairs from easy to hard? What criteria are used to determine the difficulty levels of the preference pairs?

2. Why is ordering multiple preference pairs and presenting them systematically important for improving performance? How is random shuffling of pairs inferior?

3. What is the motivation behind using the trained model from the previous DPO iteration as the reference model in the next iteration? How does this help boost performance compared to using the original SFT model each time?  

4. How does Curri-MultiPair DPO extend upon the standard single-pair DPO method? What changes were made to the loss function and training procedure to enable curriculum learning on multiple pairs?

5. What are the different scoring methods experimented with to rank multiple preference pairs based on chosen and rejected response quality differences? How does each method perform?  

6. How does iterative training in Curri-MultiPair DPO help over non-iterative training on the same set of ranked pairs? What performance gains are observed across different benchmarks?

7. Why does Curri-MultiPair DPO outperform single-pair DPO baselines in majority of experiments? When does the single best pair DPO perform the best?

8. How does the performance of Curri-MultiPair DPO vary with the different reference model selections and ranking criteria used? Which works the best and why?

9. What are some of the limitations of the current Curri-MultiPair DPO method? How can the approach be extended to use more preference pairs per prompt in future work? 

10. How does Curri-MultiPair DPO compare to other existing methods that also utilize multiple preference responses? What is the key difference in methodology?
