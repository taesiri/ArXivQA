# [SugarCrepe: Fixing Hackable Benchmarks for Vision-Language   Compositionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14610)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: Do existing benchmarks for evaluating the compositionality of vision-language models contain biases/artifacts that allow models to cheat, leading to an overestimation of their true capabilities? The key hypothesis is that current benchmarks for measuring the compositional understanding abilities of vision-language models contain significant biases, which renders them ineffective. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:1. The hard negatives in existing benchmarks contain nonsensical and non-fluent artifacts, allowing text-only models without access to the image to outperform vision-language models by exploiting these biases.2. Recently proposed methods that augment training with hard negatives likely improve performance on existing biased benchmarks by overfitting to the artifacts, rather than truly enhancing compositional understanding. To test these hypotheses, the authors:1. Demonstrate that blind text-only models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on nearly all existing benchmarks by exploiting nonsensical and non-fluent biases.2. Propose a new benchmark, SUGAR-CREPE, that uses adversarial filtering to reduce biases and more faithfully measures compositionality.3. Show that recent methods have overestimated improvements on biased benchmarks, with much smaller gains on the proposed SUGAR-CREPE.In summary, the central hypothesis is that current compositionality benchmarks are ineffective due to biases, and the authors provide evidence to confirm this through empirical analysis and by proposing a new improved benchmark. Evaluating models on this more robust SUGAR-CREPE benchmark gives a very different picture of progress on compositional understanding compared to prior biased benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies significant biases present in existing benchmarks for evaluating the compositionality of vision-language models, showing that even blind text-only models without access to images can outperform state-of-the-art vision-language models on these benchmarks. 2. It introduces a new benchmark called SUGAR-CREPE to more faithfully evaluate compositionality. Compared to previous benchmarks, SUGAR-CREPE generates higher quality hard negatives using ChatGPT and employs an adversarial filtering method to minimize biases.3. It re-evaluates recent methods proposed to improve compositionality on the new SUGAR-CREPE benchmark. The results show that the effectiveness of these methods is overestimated on biased existing benchmarks, suggesting the need for more innovations in this direction.4. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of various pretrained CLIP models on the new benchmark, showing they still lack compositionality despite strong performance on downstream tasks.In summary, the main contribution is introducing a more robust benchmark for evaluating vision-language compositionality, and using it to show that current models and methods still have significant room for improvement in acquiring true compositional understanding. The new benchmark and analysis serve to more accurately measure and guide progress in this important direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper introduces SUGAR-CREPE, a new benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' compositionality that fixes biases in existing benchmarks by leveraging chatbots and adversarial filtering to generate more natural hard negatives, and shows that recent methods claiming to improve compositionality are much less effective when evaluated on this improved benchmark.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on evaluating the compositionality of vision-language models:- Scope: This paper focuses specifically on image-to-text compositionality benchmarks, while some other works have looked at text-to-image direction as well. However, the image-to-text formulation covers the majority of existing benchmarks.- Identifying Biases: A key contribution is systematically identifying and characterizing different types of biases (nonsensical and non-fluent artifacts) that make current benchmarks hackable. Other works have noted issues in benchmarks but this provides an in-depth bias analysis.- Benchmark Construction: The paper introduces a new robust benchmark, SUGAR-CREPE, that uses generative models and adversarial filtering to minimize biases. Other benchmarks rely more on rule-based or template-generated hard negatives.- Re-evaluation: By benchmarking on SUGAR-CREPE, the paper shows that recent methods to improve compositionality are not as effective as estimated on prior biased benchmarks. This is a novel analysis.- Model Analysis: The paper evaluates a large set of 17 CLIP models, revealing models still struggle with certain compositional forms like swapping. Other works evaluate fewer models.Overall, the in-depth bias characterization, model re-evaluation, and introduction of a more robust benchmark to replace existing flawed ones seem to be the main unique contributions compared to related work. The scope is also more comprehensive than many existing studies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring compositionality benchmarks formulated as text-to-image retrieval tasks, as the current work focuses on image-to-text retrieval. The authors mention that text-to-image evaluation is equally important, and future work should explore approaches to generate or mine compositional hard negative images at scale. - Employing more sophisticated techniques to remove spurious dataset artifacts beyond human comprehension. The current work identifies two human interpretable biases, but there could be other artifacts that models exploit that are not easily detectable.- Evaluating the compositionality of modern generative vision-language models, as the current work focuses on contrastively trained models like CLIP. The authors mention this is an important direction as generative models are becoming more prominent.- Considering the compositionality of models in text-to-image generation. The authors focus on image-to-text understanding in this work, but mention evaluating compositional generation is an open challenge.- Developing new compositionality benchmarks in the text-to-image form, building on initial efforts by recent works. The authors hope their findings can guide creation of more robust benchmarks in this form.In summary, the main suggested directions are: exploring text-to-image benchmarks, developing new techniques to remove subtle biases, evaluating generative models, considering compositional generation, and creating more robust text-to-image benchmarks. The authors see compositionality evaluation as an open and crucial challenge requiring further innovation.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces SugarCrepe, a new benchmark for evaluating the compositionality of vision-language models. The authors find that existing compositionality benchmarks have significant biases, shown by the fact that blind text-only models without access to images can outperform state-of-the-art vision-language models on these benchmarks. This indicates the benchmarks are ineffective at measuring true compositional understanding. To address this, SugarCrepe generates more natural and fluent hard negative texts using ChatGPT, and employs an adversarial filtering technique to remove biases. Evaluations show SugarCrepe is much more robust - blind text models now rank the worst, and recent methods proposed to improve compositionality show smaller gains on SugarCrepe compared to biased benchmarks. The authors comprehensively evaluate various CLIP models, revealing they still lack compositionality. Overall, the work introduces a more faithful benchmark for compositionality, and shows current models and training methods overestimate progress in this area.
