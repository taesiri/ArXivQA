# [The Impact of Differential Feature Under-reporting on Algorithmic   Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of "differential feature under-reporting" in administrative data used to train predictive risk models. This refers to the phenomenon where records in administrative data are more complete for individuals who rely more on public services (e.g. publicly funded healthcare). For example, in the US, medical claims data is available for Medicaid recipients but often missing for privately insured individuals. Critics have argued that such differential data availability drives disparities in algorithmic decision-making, yet this form of data bias remains technically understudied. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents an analytically tractable model of feature under-reporting and uses it to study the impact on algorithmic fairness empirically and theoretically. The problem is divided into an estimation step and prediction step. Standard missing data methods are shown to fail at mitigating unfairness. Instead, the paper proposes:
(1) Augmented loss estimation to recover ground truth model parameters. 
(2) Optimal prediction imputation tailored to the under-reporting setting.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a formal statistical model for studying differential feature under-reporting
- Provides theoretical analysis characterizing impact of under-reporting on selection rate disparities
- Empirically demonstrates that under-reporting typically increases disparities on real datasets 
- Proposes new methods tailored to under-reporting that successfully reduce disparities in experiments
- Highlights importance of studying this data bias problem with model for Allegheny County's Hello Baby system

The key insight is that standard missing data methods do not apply well since we lack indicators of missingness. The proposed solutions separately target biases arising at estimation vs at prediction time. Experiments lend credence to criticisms of systems like Allegheny County's that disparities may be driven by differential availability of administrative records across groups.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies how differential under-reporting of features in administrative data, where records are more complete for individuals relying more on public services, impacts algorithmic fairness and proposes methods to mitigate increasing disparities in high-risk individual selection rates across groups.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It formally defines and studies the problem of "differential feature under-reporting", where certain features in a dataset are more completely observed for some groups than others (e.g. health data may be more complete for those with public health insurance). 

2. It provides theoretical analysis showing how under-reporting biases model estimates and leads to unfair selection rates between groups. Specifically, it shows that the group with more under-reporting is typically under-selected, except in certain cases depending on feature correlations and variance.

3. It empirically demonstrates using semi-synthetic and real datasets that standard missing data methods like imputation and row deletion do not reliably mitigate unfairness from under-reporting.

4. It proposes new methods tailored to the under-reporting setting - augmented loss estimation to recover unbiased model parameters, and optimal prediction imputation to make better predictions at test time. Experiments show these methods can significantly reduce selection rate disparities.

In summary, the paper formally defines and studies the under-reporting problem, provides theoretical analysis on its biasing effects, empirically demonstrates resulting unfairness, and proposes new methods to mitigate it. The analysis and proposed solutions specifically targeting differential under-reporting are the main contributions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Differential feature under-reporting - Referring to the phenomenon where administrative data records are more complete for individuals who rely more on public services. This leads to data bias where some groups have more missing or unrecorded information.

- Algorithmic fairness - Studying the fairness implications of predictive models trained on data with differential under-reporting. Analyzing disparities in selection rates across groups.

- Missing not at random (MNAR) - The type of missing data mechanism occurring in the studied setting where missingness depends on unobserved factors. 

- Two-step bias - Under-reporting introduces bias both during model estimation/training and when making predictions on new under-reported data. 

- Excess selection rate - Defined metric to quantify the impact of under-reporting on outcome disparities across groups while accounting for ground truth differences.

- Linear regression setting - Much of the theoretical analysis studies the effect of under-reporting in a regression setting with a linear ground truth model.

- Augmented loss estimation - Proposed method to recover unbiased model estimates by reweighing the loss on observed and defaulted feature values.

- Optimal prediction imputation - Deriving loss-minimizing imputation values for under-reported feature entries at prediction time.

The key focus is studying the problem of differential under-reporting and its impact on fairness formally. The paper proposes both theoretical results and empirical evaluations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new statistical model for differential feature under-reporting. How does this model differ from traditional missing data models like MCAR, MAR, and MNAR? What new insights does it provide?

2. The authors define a new metric called "excess selection rate" to quantify the impact of under-reporting on algorithmic fairness. What is the intuition behind this metric and why is it useful? How does it capture unfairness beyond standard group-level statistical parity metrics?

3. The paper analyzes the bias introduced in linear regression estimates under the proposed under-reporting model. Can you walk through the derivations and provide some intuition for why attenuation bias and correlation bias occur?

4. How exactly does the direction of the correlation bias in unaffected feature estimates depend on the correlations between features and the signs of the true parameters? Can you provide a visual intuition?  

5. The authors state that under-reporting does not always lead to under-selection of the impacted group. What are the precise conditions under which over-selection can occur instead? Explain the variance-based intuition.

6. Explain the high-level ideas behind the proposed methods of augmented loss estimation and optimal prediction imputation. Why can't standard missing data methods be applied directly? What adjustments need to be made?

7. The optimal prediction imputation value requires knowledge of the under-reporting rate. How does the proposed estimation procedure for the under-reporting rate work? What assumptions does it make? How robust is it?

8. The empirical evaluation relies on semi-synthetic outcome data. What are the benefits of this modeling choice and what are its limitations? How would results potentially change in a real noisy outcome setting?

9. Beyond the technical contributions, what are some real-world implications of the finding that under-reporting often exacerbates existing disparities? Provide some examples of sensitive applications.

10. The paper clearly states limitations of proposed methods on real administrative data. What concrete next steps would you propose to make technical progress on mitigating issues introduced by differential under-reporting?
