# [Diversity Enhanced Active Learning with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Active learning (AL) aims to reduce labelling costs by judiciously selecting the most informative samples to be labelled by experts. However, designing good acquisition functions that measure sample informativeness is still an open research problem.

- Recent methods have issues: BALD ignores actual errors, MOCU/ELR have convergence issues, WMOCU only minimizes errors. Semi-supervised AL methods are unfair to compare against. 

- Need robust and flexible acquisition functions suitable for different tasks, with theoretical guarantees, and that work well with neural networks.

Proposed Solution:

- Propose BEMPS framework based on strictly proper scoring rules and Bregman divergences used to train neural networks. Defines acquisition function using expected increase in proper scores.

- Instantiate BEMPS with mean squared error (CoreMSE) and log probability (CoreLog). Prove convergence for BEMPS acquisition functions.

- Complement BEMPS with batch mode AL algorithm that encourages diversity using k-means on vectors of expected score changes.

- Use ensembles and dynamic validation sets to get uncertainty estimates from neural networks without separate validation set.

Contributions:

- BEMPS framework and accretion functions based on proper scoring rules 

- Convergence guarantees for BEMPS and BALD acquisition functions

- Batch algorithm to complement BEMPS acquisition functions

- Ensembling with dynamic validation sets for neural network uncertainty

- Extensive evaluation on multiple text classification datasets verifies efficacy of CoreMSE and CoreLog for active learning.

The key advantage is the flexibility and theoretical foundation of BEMPS allowing its use in different tasks, along with the robust overall system design.
