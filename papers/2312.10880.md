# [Sharable Clothoid-based Continuous Motion Planning for Connected   Automated Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10880)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of motion planning for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Specifically, it focuses on developing a local motion planner that can efficiently generate smooth, feasible trajectories between waypoints provided by a higher-level global planner. The local planner should prioritize interpretability, shareability via V2X messages, and ability to satisfy boundary conditions over minimum time trajectories. Existing methods like optimization-based planners, graph search planners, and path smoothing methods have limitations in meeting these criteria simultaneously.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a local motion planning method based on interpolating three consecutive clothoid curves that generates continuous curvature (G2) paths exactly satisfying given boundary conditions. This path planner is then combined with a velocity profiler that plans smooth longitudinal velocity aligned with the path segments. The overall motion plan requires solving only a small set of nonlinear algebraic equations and can be represented by 19 intuitive physical parameters (e.g. clothoid sharpnesses, velocities, accelerations).

Key Contributions:

1) A highly interpretable and shareable local motion planner requiring only 19 parameters to represent complete trajectories. Allows encoding in V2X messages with very limited bandwidth.

2) Guaranteed satisfaction of boundary conditions enables seamless integration with global planners that provide waypoints.

3) Tunable parameters generating multiple feasible motion plan options for given boundaries. Allows optimizing trajectories based on comfort, duration etc.

4) Efficient collision checking by tracking boundary of swept volumes of key vehicle points. Enables conflict resolution through plan sharing.

5) Applicable to a wide variety of maneuvers like turns, lane changes, U-turns. Performance comparable to benchmark planners in metrics like duration, maximum curvature.

In summary, the paper proposes an intuitive clothoid-based local planner overcoming limitations of prior art and useful for connected autonomous driving systems via its compactness, flexibility and V2X shareability.
