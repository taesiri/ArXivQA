# [Magic Fixup: Streamlining Photo Editing by Watching Dynamic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13044)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Image editing is a tedious process that requires professional skills to make edits look realistic by fixing inconsistencies in lighting, shadows, reflections etc. Existing generative models can synthesize realistic images but lack control and often change image identity. The goal is to develop an image editing method that provides control like traditional editing while automatically making the edits photorealistic.

Method: 
1) User Interface: Allow users to segment image into objects, duplicate, delete or rearrange them with simple 2D transforms to specify a desired coarse edit.

2) Diffusion Model Pipeline: Use two diffusion models - a synthesizer to generate the final output, and a detail extractor to transfer fine details from input to output. Models initialized from Stable Diffusion and finetuned.

3) Detail Transfer: Detail extractor provides features from input image to guide synthesis and preserve appearance. Features injected into synthesizer via cross-attention layers.

4) Training Data: Construct supervised dataset from videos by extracting image pairs, warping source towards target frame using flow and piecewise affine models to mimic expected test edits. Train to convert warped source into target frame.

Key Insights:
- Videos provide supervision for how objects change under different viewpoints and lighting.
- Coarse-to-fine training alignment encourages model to follow user edits.
- Detail transfer allows preserving image identity.

Contributions:
- Collage Transform interface for intuitive spatial editing 
- Video-supervised dataset and training method
- Diffusion model architecture using detail transfer for controlled photorealistic editing

The method allows users to easily specify edits by rearranging objects, while automatically harmonizing lighting and reflections realistically, preserving fine details and identity better than previous state-of-the-art methods.
