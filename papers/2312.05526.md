## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Reinforcement Neighborhood Selection for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection":

Problem:
- Unsupervised graph anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies in graphs that exhibit rare patterns deviating from the majority, without anomaly labels. 
- GNN-based methods learn representations by neighborhood aggregation, but anomalies make the neighborhood unreliable, resulting in poor representation learning.
- Selecting proper neighborhoods is critical but challenging due to: (1) lack of anomaly-oriented guidance; (2) interdependence between neighborhood selection and representation learning; (3) diversity of anomalies.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose RAND, a novel method incorporating reinforcement neighborhood selection and anomaly-aware message aggregation.
- Extend candidate neighborhoods with 1-hop, 2-hop, high-order, attribute-based neighbors.
- Design anomaly evaluation module to assess reliability of neighbors, used as reward.
- Select reliable neighbors by multi-arm bandit reinforcement learning based on rewards.
- Introduce anomaly-aware aggregator to amplify messages from reliable neighbors and diminish from unreliable ones.  
- Perform reconstruction on graph properties for training and anomaly scoring.

Main Contributions:
- Highlight negative impact of anomalies on neighborhood reliability for GNN-based anomaly detection.  
- Propose RAND, incorporating reinforcement neighborhood selection and anomaly-aware message aggregation.
- Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show state-of-the-art performance.

In summary, the paper tackles a critical challenge of unreliable neighborhoods caused by anomalies in GNN-based anomaly detection. It proposes an innovative solution RAND using reinforcement learning for adaptive neighborhood selection and anomaly-aware aggregation. Experiments verify its effectiveness.
