# [Soft Prompt Threats: Attacking Safety Alignment and Unlearning in   Open-Source LLMs through the Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09063)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most prior work on adversarial attacks against LLMs focuses on manipulating discrete input tokens. However, for open-source models with full model access, attacks can directly manipulate the continuous embedding space. This threat model is currently under-explored.  

- As open-source LLMs advance rapidly in capability, ensuring their safety and security becomes imperative. However, their vulnerability against embedding space attacks tailored to open-source models remains unclear.

Method:
- The authors propose embedding space attacks that directly perturb the continuous vector representations of input tokens to trigger unsafe model behaviors.

- Two attack settings are studied: (1) Individual attacks optimized for a single input, (2) Universal attacks optimized over multiple inputs to improve generalization.  

- The attacks are evaluated on two tasks: (1) Breaking safety alignment to trigger harmful responses (2) Extracting supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs.

Key Results: 
- Embedding attacks break safety alignment substantially faster than prior attacks, removing alignment in just 9 iterations on average. They also generalize better than fine-tuning.

- Embedding attacks successfully extract more deleted information from unlearned LLMs than direct prompting, even when using multiple prompt attempts. This demonstrates their ability to rigorously interrogate unlearned models.

- A novel cumulative success rate metric is proposed to quantify information leakage from unlearned models over multiple prompt attempts. Surprisingly, simple top-k sampling also proves an effective attack. 

Main Contributions:
- First demonstration of the effectiveness of embedding space attacks to compromise safety of open-source LLMs and unlearned models.

- Introduction of new metrics tailored to continuously attack and evaluate unlearned models over multiple attempts.

- Findings highlight need to re-evaluate defense methods against this overlooked but highly potent threat model as open-source LLMs continue advancing rapidly.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes embedding space attacks that directly manipulate the continuous vector representation of tokens to effectively break safety alignment and extract supposedly deleted information from open-source language models, highlighting vulnerabilities beyond the discrete token level.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It shows that embedding space attacks can effectively remove safety alignment in LLMs on four different open-source models, achieving successful attacks orders of magnitude faster than prior work.

2. It finds that embedding space attacks can generalize to unseen harmful behaviors, allowing a single embedding attack to remove the alignment for several harmful instructions. Compared to fine-tuning an LLM to remove its safety alignment, embedding space attacks prove to be computationally less expensive while achieving the same or higher success rates.

3. It presents a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and shows that embedding space attacks can extract significantly more information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. This presents a new use case for adversarial attacks as an "interrogation" tool for unlearned models.

In summary, the paper demonstrates embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs, both for breaking safety alignment and extracting supposedly deleted information from unlearned models. It highlights the need to further investigate defenses against such continuous attacks on LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Embedding space attacks

- Toxicity evaluation
- Discrete attacks
- Continuous attacks
- Threat models

- Model interrogation
- Model vulnerabilities
- Model robustness

The paper introduces the concept of "embedding space attacks" which directly attack the continuous embedding representation of input tokens in large language models, rather than just manipulating the discrete input tokens. It evaluates the effectiveness of such attacks for bypassing safety alignment and extracting supposedly deleted information from unlearned models. The key terms reflect the focus on adversarial threats in LLMs, attacking open-source models, breaking safety measures, and assessing robustness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose embedding space attacks as a novel threat model for open-source LLMs. How might embedding space attacks differ fundamentally from other adversarial attacks like discrete input manipulations? What unique advantages or disadvantages might they have?

2. The paper evaluates embedding attacks on removing safety alignment and extracting supposedly deleted information. Can you think of other potential use cases or applications where embedding attacks could be impactfully used as an interrogation tool for open-source models?

3. When attacking model safety alignment, the authors find embedding attacks can generalize to unseen instructions. What properties of embedding attacks might enable this generalization capability and how does it compare to other methods like model fine-tuning?  

4. For the task of attacking unlearned models, the authors propose a new evaluation metric called cumulative success rate. What are the motivations behind this metric and how does it differ from a one-shot evaluation? What are its strengths and limitations?

5. The success rate of multi-layer attacks varies across the two tasks. What might explain why multi-layer attacks perform better on the Harry Potter Q&A task but not on the TOFU benchmark? How could the multi-layer attack be improved?

6. Top-k sampling proves surprisingly effective at extracting unlearned information. Why might top-k sampling be an effective attack and how does it compare to embedding attacks? Could both approaches be combined?

7. The authors use the toxic-bert model to evaluate response toxicity. What are limitations of this evaluation approach and how else could response toxicity be quantified in future work?

8. For safety alignment experiments, could the attack loss be used as an indicator of response toxicity? What experiments could be done to further analyze this relationship?

9. The paper analyzes 5 different open-source models. Are there any interesting differences between models in terms of vulnerability to embedding attacks? Why might certain models be more robust?  

10. What defenses could potentially protect against embedding attacks? How might their effectiveness compare to defenses against discrete input manipulations? What challenges are unique to safeguarding the embedding space?
