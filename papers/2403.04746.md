# [LLMs in the Imaginarium: Tool Learning through Simulated Trial and Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tools are important for extending the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), allowing them to acquire updated information and take actions in external environments. 
- Prior work has focused on expanding the breadth of tools accessible to LLMs, but surprisingly little attention has been paid to accurately using the tools available. 
- Existing LLMs show poor performance in correctly using tools they have been trained on, with rates only between 30-60% even for the best models like GPT-4. This is far from reliable for practical deployment where inaccurate tool use could lead to harmful outcomes.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a biologically inspired strategy called simulated trial and error (STE) to improve tool use accuracy. 
- STE orchestrates an LLM's imagination to simulate scenarios for using a tool, interacts with the tool to gather experiences from execution feedback, and employs short and long-term memories to drive progressive and comprehensive exploration.
- After exploration, the tool use examples are distilled to fine-tune the LLM or used for in-context learning.

Key Results:
- Experiments on 50 APIs show the superiority of STE: it boosts the tool use correctness of Mistral-Instruct-7B by 46.7% with in-context learning, enabling it to outperform GPT-4. 
- Fine-tuning with STE improves performance further, with the best model achieving 76.8% correctness.
- A simple replay strategy enables continual learning of new tools while preserving existing capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Identified and quantified the unsatisfying tool use performance of existing LLMs as an important yet understudied problem.
- Proposed simulated trial and error, a novel strategy for improving LLM tool use accuracy inspired by biological learning. 
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach under both in-context and fine-tuning settings, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art.
- Showed the promise of mitigating catastrophic forgetting for continual tool learning.
