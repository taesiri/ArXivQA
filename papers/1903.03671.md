# [Lenses and Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03671)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper explores the mathematical relationship between lenses and learners. The central result is a theorem showing that there is a faithful, identity-on-objects, symmetric monoidal functor from the category of learners to a category of symmetric lenses. Specifically, the paper shows:- Learners can be viewed as asymmetric lenses between a parameter set and an output set. - Learners can also be viewed as symmetric lenses, with the left leg being a constant complement lens and the right leg being the asymmetric lens corresponding to the learner.- The composition and monoidal product of learners corresponds precisely to the composition and monoidal product of these symmetric lenses.So in summary, the central result is a precise correspondence between learners and a certain class of symmetric lenses, established via a symmetric monoidal functor. This reveals a surprising connection between the compositional treatment of supervised learning algorithms (learners) and bidirectional transformations (lenses).


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is establishing a connection between the concepts of lenses and learners by showing that there is a faithful, identity-on-objects, symmetric monoidal functor embedding the category of learners into a category of symmetric lenses. Specifically, the paper shows:- Learners can be viewed as asymmetric lenses between the parameter set and the input/output sets.- Learners can also be viewed as symmetric lenses with a constant complement left leg and a bare asymmetric lens right leg. - There is a functor embedding the category of learners into a category of symmetric lenses of this form that preserves composition and monoidal products.In summary, the paper reveals a tight mathematical relationship between lenses and learners by constructing a functor between their categories that preserves the compositional structure. This is a surprising and novel connection between two previously disjoint fields.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper shows there is a close relationship between lenses, which model bidirectional transformations, and learners, which model supervised learning algorithms, by constructing functors between categories of lenses and learners that preserve the compositional structure.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research on lenses and learners:- It establishes a novel connection between the concept of "lenses" from bidirectional programming and "learners" from machine learning. Prior to this work, these two areas were seen as largely unrelated. The authors show there is actually a close mathematical relationship between them.- The paper provides a functor embedding the category of learners into a category of symmetric lenses. This shows that learners can be viewed as a special type of symmetric lens, with constant complement lenses on the left and bare lenses on the right. - It generalizes the usual notion of symmetric lens composition, which normally requires well-behavedness. The authors define composition for symmetric lenses where only the left leg satisfies PutGet, allowing bare lenses on the right.- The work suggests properties like PutGet and GetPut could be desirable for learners ("learner laws"). This frames supervised learning in terms of established lens concepts.- The simple bare lenses corresponding to learners are not typical in lens research, which has focused more on well-behaved lenses. This demonstrates a novel application of bare lenses.- The constant complement left legs link learners to other advanced lens concepts like amendment lenses. The paper speculates on further connections in this direction.Overall, the key novelty is establishing a formal relationship between lenses and learners, two previously disparate areas. This sheds new light on both fields and suggests many directions for further research integrating their concepts and techniques.
