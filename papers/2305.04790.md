 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents MultiModal-GPT, a vision and language model fine-tuned from OpenFlamingo using comprehensive datasets of image and text instructions, which is capable of engaging in multi-turn dialogues that follow human instructions and preferences.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on MultiModal-GPT compares to other recent research on multimodal dialogue models:

- The key innovation is using a unified instruction template to jointly train on both language-only and vision-language datasets. This improves the conversational abilities of the model compared to prior work like LLaMA and Flamingo that lacked language instruction tuning. 

- Efficiently fine-tuning from an existing model (OpenFlamingo) allows incorporating large-scale image data that was computationally prohibitive for models like LLaVA and Mini-GPT. The perceiver resampler provides efficiency benefits over approaches relying solely on self-attention.

- Using synthetic instructions for the COCO dataset is an interesting technique to adapt inherently non-instructional caption data for instruction-following objectives. This sets it apart from prior work focusing only on datasets designed specifically for instruction-following.

- The emphasis on dialog quality and avoiding degraded responses from certain VQA datasets aligns with recent trends favoring conversational ability over just visual question answering accuracy.

- The model architecture stays close to established designs like Flamingo rather than proposing entirely new model designs. The focus is more on training techniques and data composition.

- The scale is smaller than massive models like GPT-4 and Mini-GPT4 in terms of parameters and data size. But the goal is a practical and reproducible model design rather than maximizing raw scale.

Overall, the key novelties are in training methodology and data composition compared to prior work. The results demonstrate improved conversational ability thanks to techniques like joint training and synthetic instructions. It represents an incremental advance focused on quality and practicality rather than massive scale.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?
