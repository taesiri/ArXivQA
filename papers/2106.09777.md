# [On Invariance Penalties for Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09777)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is:How can we improve upon the original invariant risk minimization (IRM) framework proposed by Arjovsky et al. (2019) for out-of-distribution generalization? Specifically, the authors identify some limitations with the original IRMv1 penalty proposed by Arjovsky et al. and show theoretically and empirically that it can fail to capture invariance in some cases. To address this, they propose an alternative invariance penalty called IRMv2 that is more directly comparable to the risk and can recover invariant representations under certain assumptions.The central hypothesis is that their proposed IRMv2 penalty will lead to better out-of-distribution generalization performance compared to the original IRMv1 penalty in some cases where IRMv1 fails. The authors test this hypothesis through theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets.In summary, the key research question is how to improve IRM for invariance and out-of-distribution generalization, with a focus on proposing a better invariance penalty than the original IRMv1. The central hypothesis is that their proposed IRMv2 penalty will outperform IRMv1 in some cases.
