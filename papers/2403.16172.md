# [Fusion of Minutia Cylinder Codes and Minutia Patch Embeddings for Latent   Fingerprint Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Latent fingerprint recognition is challenging compared to sensor fingerprint recognition due to poor quality of latent images collected from crime scenes. Deformation and artifacts in latent prints negatively affect recognition performance. While local descriptor based methods like Minutia Cylinder Codes (MCC) work well for sensor fingerprints, their performance drops significantly for latent prints. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a feature level fusion approach to combine MCC vectors with MinNet embedding vectors, which are learned representations from a deep neural network. The key ideas are:

1) Extract and represent each minutia in a fingerprint using two descriptors - MCC vector and MinNet embedding vector. This captures complementary information about each minutia.

2) Compute similarity scores between latent and sensor fingerprint minutiae pairs using each descriptor separately. This results in two similarity score matrices.

3) Select top matching minutiae pairs from both similarity matrices and aggregate them. Apply Local Similarity Sort with Relaxation to measure compatibility of minutiae pairs and generate final match score.

The fusion of handcrafted MCC features and learned MinNet embeddings improves latent fingerprint recognition accuracy.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel feature level fusion idea to combine MCC and MinNet minutia descriptors for latent fingerprint recognition

- Achieves significant improvement in rank-1 identification accuracy over individual descriptors as well as state-of-the-art methods on 3 public and private datasets

- Shows that fusing complementary minutia information helps handle distortion in latents better than using individual descriptor types

The main highlight is leveraging strengths of both engineered MCC features and learned deep network MinNet embeddings via fusion to push state-of-the-art in latent fingerprint recognition.
