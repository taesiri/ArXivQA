# [Globally Optimal Inverse Kinematics as a Quadratic Program](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15569)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inverse kinematics (IK) involves finding the joint parameters to move a robot manipulator to a desired pose. 
- For manipulators with more than 6 joints, IK becomes an underconstrained problem with many possible solutions. The paper focuses on finding solutions that minimize the movement from the current joint angles.
- Existing approaches either approximate/locally optimize solutions or constrain the robot design. The paper aims to efficiently find globally optimal IK solutions for generic manipulators.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate IK as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) by lifting the polynomial constraints (e.g. introduce new variables for products).  
- Use spatial branch-and-bound solvers like SCIP or Gurobi to globally solve the non-convex QCQP formulation.
- Compare two lifting approaches: A) Introduce new variable per quadratic term, B) Introduce matrix of new variables for matrix products in kinematic chain.
- Use local solvers to provide a warm start solution to speed up global search.

Contributions:
- New QCQP formulation allows finding guaranteed globally optimal IK solutions for generic manipulators.
- Demonstrates solving 7DOF manipulators faster than prior sum-of-squares programming approach.
- First technique to solve global optimal IK for 8+ DOF manipulators in reasonable time.
- Can optimize over 10DOF chains in about a minute and proves optimality.
- Applicable beyond IK as a general polynomial optimization technique.
- Also detects infeasible poses efficiently.
- Can be used for optimizing manipulator designs themselves by treating parameters as variables.

In summary, the paper presents a new and efficient way to globally solve inverse kinematics for redundant manipulators by posing it as a QCQP problem. This also has applications in evaluating and optimizing robot designs.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes a new method to solve the inverse kinematics (IK) problem for robotic manipulators by formulating it as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). The key benefits of this approach are:

1) It can find globally optimal IK solutions for generic manipulators with up to 10 degrees of freedom, which has not been possible with prior methods. 

2) For 7 DOF manipulators, it can find optimal solutions significantly faster than the previous state-of-the-art method based on sum-of-squares optimization.

3) It provides guarantees on the optimality of solutions, allowing performance evaluation and comparison to other techniques.

4) The QCQP formulation makes the problem amenable to solution by highly optimized global optimization solvers. This allows the method to scale better compared to specialized techniques that are theoretically more efficient but less optimized in practice.

In summary, the main contribution is a new QCQP-based formulation and solution method for the IK problem that achieves new performance benchmarks in terms of speed and ability to handle more complex robotic designs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using SCIP and Gurobi for solving the QCQP formulation of the IK problem. What are the key differences between these solvers and why does Gurobi perform better for this application?

2. The paper compares the QCQP approach to an SOS-based approach. What are the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of each method? Why does QCQP work better in practice for IK problems?

3. The paper discusses different "lifting" techniques for reformulating the polynomials in the IK constraints as QCQP. Can you explain the key differences between the lifting approaches and why some perform better than others? 

4. Warm starting the QCQP solver with a local solution is shown to improve performance. What type of local solver is used and what are its failure modes? How much does warm starting actually improve the QCQP runtimes?

5. For the iCub robot, the paper shows the local solutions found are often nearly globally optimal. Why might this be the case? Does this depend on properties of the iCub's mechanical design?  

6. The paper demonstrates the method scales to 10 DOF. What are the computational bottlenecks to applying the method to even higher DOF manipulators? Could parallelization or other techniques help address these?

7. One advantage claimed is the ability to optimize over kinematic parameters by adding them as variables. How difficult does this make the QCQP and what is the practical limit on how many parameters could be optimized simultaneously?

8. The method is faster at detecting infeasible poses than solving for optimal joint angles. Why might this be the case? Are there ways to make infeasibility detection even faster?

9. While faster than prior methods, the QCQP approach is still too slow for real-time control. What modifications or approximations could be made to adapt the method for real-time performance? What would be lost?

10. The github implementation is in Julia. What are the tradeoffs of using Julia versus lower-level languages like C++ for this type of numeric optimization application? Could GPU acceleration help?
