# [Globally Optimal Inverse Kinematics as a Quadratic Program](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15569)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inverse kinematics (IK) involves finding the joint parameters to move a robot manipulator to a desired pose. 
- For manipulators with more than 6 joints, IK becomes an underconstrained problem with many possible solutions. The paper focuses on finding solutions that minimize the movement from the current joint angles.
- Existing approaches either approximate/locally optimize solutions or constrain the robot design. The paper aims to efficiently find globally optimal IK solutions for generic manipulators.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate IK as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) by lifting the polynomial constraints (e.g. introduce new variables for products).  
- Use spatial branch-and-bound solvers like SCIP or Gurobi to globally solve the non-convex QCQP formulation.
- Compare two lifting approaches: A) Introduce new variable per quadratic term, B) Introduce matrix of new variables for matrix products in kinematic chain.
- Use local solvers to provide a warm start solution to speed up global search.

Contributions:
- New QCQP formulation allows finding guaranteed globally optimal IK solutions for generic manipulators.
- Demonstrates solving 7DOF manipulators faster than prior sum-of-squares programming approach.
- First technique to solve global optimal IK for 8+ DOF manipulators in reasonable time.
- Can optimize over 10DOF chains in about a minute and proves optimality.
- Applicable beyond IK as a general polynomial optimization technique.
- Also detects infeasible poses efficiently.
- Can be used for optimizing manipulator designs themselves by treating parameters as variables.

In summary, the paper presents a new and efficient way to globally solve inverse kinematics for redundant manipulators by posing it as a QCQP problem. This also has applications in evaluating and optimizing robot designs.
