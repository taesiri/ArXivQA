# [Residual Learning for Image Point Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15471)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Handcrafted feature descriptors like SIFT and SURF are accurate for point localization but learned descriptors capture more descriptive power. However, learned methods have not surpassed handcrafted methods in real applications like 3D reconstruction. 
- Can we improve handcrafted descriptors by learning in conjunction with them? Can we combine complementary strengths of both approaches?

Method:
- Propose a simple learning framework with 3 components:
  - Handcrafted feature extractor (SIFT/SURF) 
  - CNN-based learned descriptor
  - Fusion module to combine both descriptors
- Handcrafted extractor provides keypoints and descriptors to CNN module
- CNN module outputs learned descriptors at those keypoints 
- Fusion module projects handcrafted descriptors using MLP, concatenates with CNN descriptors
- Overall model is trained using metric learning on image augmentations

Contributions:
- Shows that adding a small CNN module to handcrafted descriptors boosts performance over both individual components
- Achieves much faster convergence compared to baseline methods by avoiding learning redundant knowledge
- Outperforms state-of-the-art learned and handcrafted methods on matching, camera localization and 3D reconstruction
- Demonstrates an effective way to incorporate non-differentiable functions like handcrafted descriptors into a learning framework
- Has applications for ensemble learning and learning with non-differentiable functions

In summary, the paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to combine strengths of handcrafted and learned feature descriptors. By avoiding redundant learning and focusing only on residual knowledge in the CNN module, it achieves better performance than previous learned methods while retaining efficiency. The core idea of fusing non-differentiable functions with deep networks enables more powerful hybrid feature extraction.
