# [Real-time Network Intrusion Detection via Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07696)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Many cybersecurity problems requiring real-time decision-making from temporal observations, such as network intrusion detection, can be formulated as sequential decision problems. Existing approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have limitations - the Markovian property may not hold, and network states are often not fully observable. There is a need for a simple, scalable solution that can identify attacks at the packet level for accelerated detection speed and timeliness.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes casting network intrusion detection as causal sequence modeling to leverage the power of transformer architectures for real-time decision making. A causally masked decision transformer (DT) is conditioned on past trajectories of rewards, network packets, and detection decisions to generate future detection decisions. This allows applying DTs for real-time network intrusion detection with a novel tradeoff between accuracy and timeliness.  

An autoencoder efficiently compresses arbitrary-length packet sequences into compact embeddings as input features for the DT. The accuracy-timeliness tradeoff is achieved by introducing a reward function that penalizes delayed detections. Non-optimal collected trajectories are used for training to evaluate practical performance.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates network intrusion detection as a sequence modeling problem for decision-making and investigates DT's effectiveness using non-optimal trajectories.

- Proposes an autoencoder to integrate packet payload features into compressed embeddings as sequential input suitable for the causal transformer. 

- Explores a novel tradeoff between detection accuracy and timeliness by penalizing delayed detections in the reward function.

- Evaluates the proposed DT solution on real-world datasets, outperforming RL baselines in accuracy and timeliness.

The results showcase DT's capabilities for network intrusion detection. The sequence modeling perspective transcends restrictive assumptions like the Markov property. The framework is promising for specialized architectures and embeddings to further improve performance.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new framework for network intrusion detection by formulating it as a sequential decision-making problem and applying offline reinforcement learning techniques. Specifically, adopting the Decision Transformer architecture to model the continuous network traffic data for timely packet-level detection.

2. Introducing a tradeoff between detection accuracy and timeliness using a reward function that accounts for both correct and fast threat identification. 

3. Conducting experiments on data derived from the UNSW-NB15 dataset that show the proposed method balances response speed and precision, outperforming baselines in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score while achieving higher rewards that quantify timelier detection.

4. Validating the capability of modeling the sequential decision process using decision transformers as an offline RL problem for network intrusion detection, opening research avenues into specialized architectures and embeddings for this application.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a new decision transformer-based framework for network intrusion detection that transforms the problem into a sequential decision-making task and demonstrates improved performance over baselines.
