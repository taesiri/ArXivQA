# [Native Language Identification with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07819)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents the first experiments applying large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to native language identification (NLI). NLI involves predicting a writer's first language by analyzing their writings in a second language. The authors show that GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark TOEFL11 dataset, reaching 91.7% accuracy in a zero-shot setting without any NLI-specific training. They demonstrate that LLMs can perform open-set NLI without being limited to a predefined set of language classes, enabling more practical real-world application. Finally, the authors explore using GPT-4 to provide natural language explanations justifying its NLI predictions, citing examples of language transfer patterns from the writer's native language. While further analysis is needed, this explainability could offer valuable insights for second language acquisition research and tailored instruction. Overall, this paper shows the promise of leveraging recent advances in LLMs to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in NLI across metrics of accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability.
