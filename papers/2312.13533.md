# [Automated Clinical Coding for Outpatient Departments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13533)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Clinical coding is the process of assigning standardized codes to medical records to enable analysis and billing. Prior work has focused on automating coding for inpatient records, but outpatient coding is overlooked.  
- Outpatient coding has unique challenges like shorter, incomplete notes and coders being the note authors, omitting details assuming own memory.
- It is unclear if inpatient coding methods work for outpatient data and what adaptations may be needed.

Methods
- Collected a large-scale outpatient dataset from a Taiwan hospital with 7M+ notes over 550K patients.
- Evaluated 4 state-of-the-art inpatient coding models on this data - CAML, LAAT, MSMN and PLM-based.
- Proposed OPD-Reranker model to incorporate structured and unstructured additional information.
- Analyzed model performance vs training set size, easy vs hard examples.

Key Findings
- Inpatient coding advances transfer reasonably to outpatient coding.
- Hospital-specific language model encoders outperform other encoders.  
- Models saturate in performance quickly, 50% data gives 99% score.
- 61% of examples can be perfectly coded by model, 50% of those can be identified automatically.

Main Contributions
- First study investigating automated outpatient clinical coding feasibility.
- Dataset of 7M+ outpatient notes over 550K patients.
- Evaluation of state-of-the-art inpatient models on outpatient data.
- Proposed adaptations like OPD-Reranker and easy case identification to further assist outpatient coding.

The summary covers the key points on the problem, proposed solution and contributions while highlighting main results. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
