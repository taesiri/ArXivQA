# [LLaVA-UHD: an LMM Perceiving Any Aspect Ratio and High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V and LLaVA-1.5 process images in fixed low resolutions and aspect ratios. This leads to three key issues: 
(1) Shape distortion and blurring of image content. 
(2) Wasted computation from padding non-square images into squares.  
(3) Systematic flaws in correctness and potential vulnerability to adversarial attacks, as shown through controlled experiments on GPT-4V and LLaVA-1.5.

Proposed Solution - LLaVA-UHD:
The paper proposes LLaVA-UHD, an LMM that can efficiently process high-resolution images in any aspect ratio. It has three key components:

1. Image Modularization: Divides images into smaller variable-sized slices based on an optimal partition strategy. This enables full adaptivity without padding or distortion.

2. Compression Layer: Condenses the visual tokens of each slice using a perceiver resampler to reduce computation. 

3. Spatial Schema: Organizes the compressed slice tokens to inform their positions.

Main Contributions:
1. First mechanistic investigation of flaws in GPT-4V from the lens of visual encoding strategies.

2. Proposal of LLaVA-UHD, an efficient and adaptive LMM for high-resolution arbitrary aspect ratio image understanding.

3. Comprehensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance of LLaVA-UHD over strong baselines on 9 benchmarks. For example, LLaVA-UHD built on LLaVA-1.5 backbone improved TextVQA accuracy by +6.4 supporting 6 times larger images using 94% computation.

4. In-depth analysis and ablation studies for better understanding of model behaviors.

The paper makes significant progress towards enabling LMMs to properly understand real-world visual content for fine-grained reasoning capabilities.
