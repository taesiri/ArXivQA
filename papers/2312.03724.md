# [DP-OPT: Make Large Language Model Your Privacy-Preserving Prompt   Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are very effective when tailored to specific tasks through prompt tuning. However, prompt tuning relies on private/sensitive data which raises privacy concerns around confidentiality and information leakage.  
- It is impractical for individuals/companies to host large LLMs locally. Sending private data to untrusted LLM providers also intensifies privacy risks.

Proposed Solution - Differentially-Private Offsite Prompt Tuning (DP-OPT):
- Tunes prompts locally using a small LLM and limited private data. Ensures prompts do not leak private information.
- Shows prompts crafted by one LLM can transfer to another LLM without significantly compromising performance. This enables offsite deployment of locally-tuned prompts.
- Introduces differentially-private prompt generation method using ensemble of LLM predictions on disjoint data subsets. Limits privacy leakage.
- Also uses differentially-private selection to choose best prompt while protecting validation set privacy.

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end framework for private prompt tuning that keeps data local, provides formal privacy guarantees, and protects IP/ownership of cloud LLMs.
- Shows discrete prompts tuned on smaller LLMs transfer positively to larger LLMs. Motivates offsite tuning. 
- Develops first differentially-private method for discrete prompt generation and selection without gradient access. Provides strong empirical performance.

In summary, the paper proposes a practical solution called DP-OPT that allows locally tuning privacy-preserving prompts on a small LLM that can then be transferred and served on a cloud-based LLM while providing data confidentiality, information privacy and protecting the cloud LLM's IP.
