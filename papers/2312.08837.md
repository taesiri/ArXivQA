## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel approach for learning safety constraints from expert demonstrations using one-class decision trees. The key idea is to model the safe expert behavior as a convex set in a feature space. This is achieved by training a one-class decision tree on state-action tuples from the expert trajectories mapped to the feature space. The tree represents the safe set through a union of hyper-rectangles. Subsequently, a logical formula in disjunctive normal form defining the constraints is extracted from the tree. This formula is used within a constrained reinforcement learning framework as a cost function to train policies adhering to the learned constraints. A key advantage of this approach is the interpretability of both the safe set and constraints. Additionally, the method requires no knowledge about environment dynamics or reward functions. The authors evaluate their technique in several synthetic environments from a standardized safety gym benchmark and in a realistic highway driving simulator. Results demonstrate improved safety and performance over baseline reinforcement learning methods, showcasing the promise of this approach for learning interpretable safety constraints from demonstrations.
