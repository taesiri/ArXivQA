# [A Suite of Generative Tasks for Multi-Level Multimodal Webpage   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03668)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we leverage the rich multimodal content of webpages, including text, images, and structure, to study multimodal webpage understanding through generative tasks?The key points are:- Webpages contain structured multimodal content (text, images, layout) but most prior datasets only retain parts of webpages (e.g. just image-caption pairs from Wikipedia pages in the WIT dataset). - The authors introduce a new dataset, WikiWeb2M, containing over 2 million Wikipedia pages where each sample retains all text, images, and structure information. - They propose three generative tasks operating at different levels of granularity to study multimodal webpage understanding using this data: page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning.- They design a new attention mechanism, Prefix Global Attention, to leverage the webpage structure and focus on the most salient content. This performs better than standard full attention while being more efficient.- Experiments on the benchmark tasks using WikiWeb2M show the value of the complete webpage annotations compared to prior datasets. The tasks also benefit from using images, structure, and increased context.In summary, the key hypothesis is that retaining all multimodal webpage content will enable better modeling of webpage understanding through generative tasks focused at the page, section, and element levels. The WikiWeb2M dataset and benchmark tasks are introduced to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of WikiWeb2M, a new multimodal webpage dataset with 2M pages curated from English Wikipedia. The paper also proposes a suite of multimodal generative tasks for webpage understanding at different levels of granularity: page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning. To better leverage the webpage structure, the authors design a new attention mechanism called Prefix Global that selects the most salient parts of the page as global tokens. Experiments show that the webpage structure and additional annotations in WikiWeb2M lead to improved performance compared to prior datasets. The paper includes extensive ablations to study the effects of different model architectures, attention mechanisms, input modalities, and amount of context on the webpage tasks. Overall, this work provides a new benchmark for multimodal webpage understanding through the dataset, tasks, and Prefix Global attention mechanism.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a new open-source multimodal webpage dataset of 2 million pages from Wikipedia containing all text, images and structure, and uses it to study multimodal generative tasks including page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning, proposing a new attention mechanism that selects salient text and images as global tokens to attend to the full webpage content.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multimodal web page understanding:- The WikiWeb2M dataset introduced in this paper is one of the first large-scale open source datasets for multimodal web page understanding. It provides unified web page samples with all text, images, and structure from Wikipedia pages. This is a significant contribution compared to prior datasets like WIT that only contain image-caption pairs or article text. - The suite of tasks introduced (page description, section summarization, contextual image captioning) covers different levels of webpage understanding. Many prior works have focused on only one part like image-caption pairs. Studying tasks across page, section, and element levels is novel.- The Prefix Global attention mechanism allows incorporating structure and prioritizing certain inputs. This differs from most prior work that uses full attention over all inputs. Prefix Global is shown to be more efficient and achieve better performance on these tasks.- The paper includes thorough experiments analyzing different model sizes, attention schemes, input modalities, etc. This provides useful insights for multimodal modeling. For example, they find images help all tasks, even when captions are present, differing from some prior beliefs.- Most related papers have focused on webpage classification, retrieval, navigation, etc. There is limited work on generative webpage tasks and modeling the content understanding behind them. This paper makes significant progress in moving multimodal web understanding in this direction.In summary, the unified dataset, suite of tasks, and model advances like Prefix Global attention seem to push forward multimodal webpage understanding compared to related literature. The paper provides both data and modeling contributions not seen together in prior work. The ablation experiments also yield useful insights on multimodal modeling for future research to build on.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review, the authors suggest the following future research directions:1. Extending the study to other domains beyond Wikipedia: The authors note that while they curated WikiWeb2M from Wikipedia articles, webpages are a rich resource across many domains that could be used to study multimodal webpage understanding. They suggest instructional websites, news articles, recipes, blogs etc. could also provide bodies of text and images interleaved with structure that could be used for similar tasks.2. Additional webpage tasks: The authors designed their benchmark suite around generative tasks like page description, section summarization and contextual image captioning. They suggest other webpage tasks like taxonomy classification or webpage retrieval could also be studied with the WikiWeb2M dataset.3. Improving model efficiency: The authors propose Prefix Global attention as a way to improve on standard full attention, but note there is room for further efficiency gains when handling long input sequences. Areas like knowledge distillation or sparse attention could be explored.4. Incorporating additional modalities: The authors focused on modeling text and images on webpages. They suggest incorporating other sources of structure like HTML, rendered webpage regions, document layouts etc. could provide further useful signals. 5. Extending to other structured multimodal domains: While focused on webpages, the authors note their methods could apply to other datasets with structured image-text data like documents, figures, posters etc. Exploring these domains is suggested.6. Improving webpage task performance: The authors acknowledge there is still much room for improvement on their proposed benchmark tasks. Exploring different model architectures, input representations, data augmentation etc. could push state of the art.In summary, the main suggestions are expanding the tasks and domains studied, improving model efficiency for long sequences, incorporating additional modalities beyond text and images, applying the methods to new structured multimodal datasets, and advancing SOTA on the proposed webpage tasks.
