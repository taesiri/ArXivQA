# [A Suite of Generative Tasks for Multi-Level Multimodal Webpage   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03668)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we leverage the rich multimodal content of webpages, including text, images, and structure, to study multimodal webpage understanding through generative tasks?The key points are:- Webpages contain structured multimodal content (text, images, layout) but most prior datasets only retain parts of webpages (e.g. just image-caption pairs from Wikipedia pages in the WIT dataset). - The authors introduce a new dataset, WikiWeb2M, containing over 2 million Wikipedia pages where each sample retains all text, images, and structure information. - They propose three generative tasks operating at different levels of granularity to study multimodal webpage understanding using this data: page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning.- They design a new attention mechanism, Prefix Global Attention, to leverage the webpage structure and focus on the most salient content. This performs better than standard full attention while being more efficient.- Experiments on the benchmark tasks using WikiWeb2M show the value of the complete webpage annotations compared to prior datasets. The tasks also benefit from using images, structure, and increased context.In summary, the key hypothesis is that retaining all multimodal webpage content will enable better modeling of webpage understanding through generative tasks focused at the page, section, and element levels. The WikiWeb2M dataset and benchmark tasks are introduced to test this hypothesis.
