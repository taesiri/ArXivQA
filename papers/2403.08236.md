# [Point Cloud Compression via Constrained Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08236)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Point Cloud Compression via Constrained Optimal Transport":

Problem:
- Point cloud compression is important for reducing transmission and storage costs of 3D point cloud data captured by sensors. 
- Existing methods have limitations in preserving both global distribution and local density of point clouds under constrained bitrate.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate point cloud compression (PCC) as a constrained optimal transport (COT) problem to optimize the tradeoff between rate, distortion and distribution alignment.
- Implement COT with a GAN framework - the generator computes the optimal transport mapping and the discriminator calculates the Wasserstein distance to measure distribution alignment.
- Design a learnable locally density-sensitive sampler module in the encoder to facilitate compression-friendly sampling.  

Main Contributions:
- Novel COT formulation for PCC to optimize rate-distortion-distribution tradeoff.
- GAN-based implementation of COT with quadratic Wasserstein distance for stable training.
- Introduction of a learnable sampler for better downsampling during compression.
- Superior performance over state-of-the-art PCC methods on both sparse and dense point clouds, especially on global geometry quality.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel constrained optimal transport approach for point cloud compression to achieve better rate-distortion-distribution tradeoff. The key ideas include the COT formulation, GAN-based implementation and a learnable sampling module. Experiments validate improved performance over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel point cloud compression method called COT-PCC by formulating the task as a constrained optimal transport problem to simultaneously preserve local density and global distribution under bitrate constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are three-fold:

1. The authors innovatively formulate point cloud compression (PCC) tasks as a constrained optimal transport (COT) problem. By solving the COT problem, better compression performance can be achieved. 

2. A learnable sampler is introduced to facilitate the downsampling stage of the compression process by learning to select points that are beneficial for compression, instead of using traditional farthest point sampling.

3. The method is implemented with GANs and extensive experiments are conducted on both sparse and dense point cloud datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed COT-PCC approach over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both Chamfer distance and PSNR metrics.

In summary, the key innovation is formulating PCC as a COT problem to simultaneously preserve local density and global distribution under bitrate constraints. The learnable sampler and experimental validation on multiple datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
