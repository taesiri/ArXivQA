## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Point Cloud Compression via Constrained Optimal Transport":

Problem:
- Point cloud compression is important for reducing transmission and storage costs of 3D point cloud data captured by sensors. 
- Existing methods have limitations in preserving both global distribution and local density of point clouds under constrained bitrate.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate point cloud compression (PCC) as a constrained optimal transport (COT) problem to optimize the tradeoff between rate, distortion and distribution alignment.
- Implement COT with a GAN framework - the generator computes the optimal transport mapping and the discriminator calculates the Wasserstein distance to measure distribution alignment.
- Design a learnable locally density-sensitive sampler module in the encoder to facilitate compression-friendly sampling.  

Main Contributions:
- Novel COT formulation for PCC to optimize rate-distortion-distribution tradeoff.
- GAN-based implementation of COT with quadratic Wasserstein distance for stable training.
- Introduction of a learnable sampler for better downsampling during compression.
- Superior performance over state-of-the-art PCC methods on both sparse and dense point clouds, especially on global geometry quality.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel constrained optimal transport approach for point cloud compression to achieve better rate-distortion-distribution tradeoff. The key ideas include the COT formulation, GAN-based implementation and a learnable sampling module. Experiments validate improved performance over existing methods.
