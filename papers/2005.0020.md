# [Genuine quantum networks: superposed tasks and addressing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.0020)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we develop an effective framework for large-scale video+language representation learning that better captures the temporal alignment and sequential nature of videos compared to existing methods?

The key aspects are:

- Proposing a hierarchical model architecture that encodes multimodal inputs in a hierarchical fashion to capture both local and global contexts. This is in contrast to existing models that use a flat BERT-like encoder. 

- Designing new pre-training tasks (VSM and FOM) that encourage temporal alignment of multimodalities and exploit the sequential characteristics of videos.

- Using a more diverse video corpus for pre-training, beyond just instructional videos, to learn from richer visual content. 

- Introducing new challenging retrieval and QA datasets to evaluate the model's video understanding capabilities.

The overarching goal is to advance video+language representation learning by better capturing temporal dynamics through novel model architectures and pre-training tasks, training on diverse video data, and evaluating on more comprehensive benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. The proposal of a new video+language pre-training framework called HERO (Hierarchical Encoder for Omni-Representation Learning). This includes:

- A hierarchical model architecture with a Cross-modal Transformer and a Temporal Transformer to capture local and global context. 

- Two new pre-training tasks: Video-Subtitle Matching (VSM) and Frame Order Modeling (FOM), in addition to standard Masked LM and Masked Frame Modeling.

2. Pre-training on a diverse corpus including both instructional videos (HowTo100M) and TV shows to learn from richer, more complex visual content.

3. The introduction of two new challenging datasets for video moment retrieval (How2R) and QA (How2QA) based on HowTo100M videos.

4. State-of-the-art results on multiple downstream tasks including retrieval, QA, inference, and captioning across different domains and video types (multi-channel and single-channel).

In summary, the key contributions are proposing a new hierarchical Transformer-based model HERO, designing better pre-training objectives, using a more diverse pre-training corpus, collecting new challenging benchmarks, and showing superior performance on various downstream tasks compared to prior work. The main novelty seems to be in model architecture and pre-training design to better exploit temporal alignment and the sequential nature of videos.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a hierarchical Transformer-based model called HERO for large-scale video and language representation learning, which achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple video-and-language understanding tasks by leveraging novel pre-training objectives that explicitly model temporal alignment between modalities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses on video and language representation learning, an area that has gained increasing interest recently but is still relatively new compared to image and text multimodal research. The paper notes that most prior work has focused on static images rather than dynamic video. 

- The proposed model, Hero, uses a hierarchical encoder structure to better capture temporal alignment between video frames and subtitles. This differs from many existing approaches that use a flat BERT-like encoder or simple concatenation. The results demonstrate the benefits of the hierarchical design.

- The pre-training procedure incorporates two new tasks, Video-Subtitle Matching (VSM) and Frame Order Modeling (FOM), that are designed to explicitly model temporal alignment and video sequence order. This is a key novelty compared to prior work that directly adapts image-text pre-training objectives.

- For pre-training data, the paper uses both instructional videos (HowTo100M) as well as a new large-scale TV dataset. Using diverse video sources, especially those with complex social interactions, appears to be an advantage over prior work focused just on cooking videos.

- The model is evaluated on a broad set of downstream tasks including retrieval, QA, inference, and captioning across both single-channel and multi-channel videos. Showing strong performance on this diverse set of benchmarks demonstrates the versatility of the approach.

- The new How2R and How2QA datasets provide more challenging video-and-language understanding benchmarks compared to existing options like YouCook2 and MSR-VTT.

Overall, the hierarchical encoder, novel pre-training tasks, diverse video data, and thorough downstream evaluation seem to give Hero advantages over related prior art in video-and-language representation learning. The consistently strong empirical results validate the proposed techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Extending the model to other video-and-language tasks beyond the ones evaluated in the paper, such as video grounding, video summarization, etc. The authors mention this as an area for future work.

- Developing more well-designed pre-training tasks that can better capture temporal alignment between modalities and the sequential nature of videos. The authors propose two new pre-training tasks in this work (VSM and FOM) but suggest there is room for even more effective designs.

- Incorporating region-level video representations into the model architecture, instead of only using global frame-level features. The authors mention this could help for tasks like video-and-language inference where understanding region-level attributes is important.

- Designing pre-training objectives to include the decoder as well for generation tasks like video captioning. Currently the authors only pre-train the encoder of their model.

- Collecting additional diverse video datasets, beyond just HowTo100M and TV shows, to empower the model to learn from even richer visual content.

- Developing better benchmarks for evaluating video-and-language models, as existing ones are limited. The authors introduce two new datasets in this work but suggest more high-quality benchmarks are needed.

- Performing more in-depth analysis and interpretation of what the pre-trained models actually learn, using both quantitative evaluation and qualitative inspection. The authors mention this as an important direction for future work.

In summary, the key suggestions are around extending the model architecture, designing better pre-training tasks, using more diverse video data, collecting new evaluation benchmarks, and gaining more insight into these models. Advancing research in these areas could further propel video-and-language representation learning.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents HERO, a novel hierarchical Transformer-based framework for large-scale video+language representation learning. HERO encodes multimodal inputs using a Cross-Modal Transformer to fuse subtitles with associated frames and a Temporal Transformer to model global video context. Four pre-training tasks are proposed: Masked Language Modeling, Masked Frame Modeling, Video-Subtitle Matching and Frame Order Modeling, with the key novelty of explicitly capturing temporal alignment between modalities. HERO is pre-trained on HowTo100M instructional videos plus a TV dataset with complex social interactions. Extensive experiments show HERO achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse downstream tasks including video retrieval, QA, inference and captioning. Two new challenging retrieval and QA datasets collected from HowTo100M are also introduced to serve as additional benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new video and language pre-training framework called HERO (Hierarchical Encoder for Omni-Representation Learning). HERO takes as input a sequence of video frames and accompanying subtitle sentences. It encodes the multimodal inputs in a hierarchical fashion, first using a Cross-modal Transformer to fuse each subtitle sentence with its associated local video frames. Then a Temporal Transformer learns global video context from all the frame embeddings. This hierarchical design is able to better exploit the temporal alignment between subtitles and video frames compared to prior flat BERT-like architectures. 

Four pre-training tasks are designed for HERO: Masked Language Modeling, Masked Frame Modeling, Video-Subtitle Matching (VSM), and Frame Order Modeling (FOM). VSM and FOM are novel objectives that encourage temporal alignment between modalities in both global and local context. HERO is pre-trained on HowTo100M instructional videos plus a large-scale TV dataset to learn from diverse visual content. It achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple downstream tasks including video retrieval, question answering, inference, and captioning. The authors also introduce two new challenging datasets How2QA and How2R for retrieval and QA evaluation. Overall, HERO presents innovations in model architecture, pre-training tasks, training data, and benchmarks to advance video and language representation learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a new video-and-language pre-training framework called \textsc{Hero} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{E}ncode\textbf{R} for \textbf{O}mni-representation learning). The key aspect of \textsc{Hero} is its hierarchical architecture for encoding multimodal inputs. First, a Cross-modal Transformer fuses the local textual context of each video frame (from aligned subtitles) to obtain contextualized multimodal embeddings. Then a Temporal Transformer encodes all the video frames together using temporal attention, in order to capture the global video context and temporal alignment between modalities. Compared to a flat BERT-like architecture, this hierarchical design allows for explicit modeling of frame-subtitle alignment and the sequential nature of videos. Four pre-training tasks are used: Masked Language Modeling, Masked Frame Modeling, Video-Subtitle Matching, and Frame Order Modeling. The model is pre-trained on a combination of narrated instructional videos (HowTo100M dataset) and episodic TV shows, in order to learn from diverse and complex visual content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{Hero} achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple video-and-language downstream tasks involving retrieval, QA, inference and captioning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points are:

- The paper presents a new video+language large-scale pre-training framework called HERO (Hierarchical Encoder for Omni-representation learning). 

- It aims to address three main limitations in prior work on video+language pre-training models:

1) Most existing models directly adapt BERT architecture by simply concatenating subtitles and frames, losing temporal alignment between modalities. 

2) Pre-training tasks do not fully exploit the sequential nature of videos.

3) Video datasets used for pre-training are limited to instructional/cooking videos, lacking diversity.

- To address these issues, the main contributions are:

1) A hierarchical Transformer architecture to better model temporal alignment between subtitles and frames.

2) New pre-training tasks VSM and FOM that capture alignment and frame order.

3) Use of a TV dataset in addition to HowTo100M to inject more diverse video content. 

4) New retrieval and QA datasets How2R and How2QA for evaluation.

- Experiments show the proposed HERO framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple video+language downstream tasks compared to prior methods.

In summary, the key problem is improving video+language representation learning by better modeling temporal alignment and increasing diversity in pre-training data and tasks. HERO introduces a novel hierarchical architecture and pre-training approach to tackle these limitations.
