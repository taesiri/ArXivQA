# [Attention-based Point Cloud Edge Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14673)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively sample salient points from point clouds, particularly points along edges and contours, in order to improve performance on downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. The key hypothesis is that sampling edge/contour points will capture the overall shape and structure of objects in point clouds better than other sampling methods like random sampling or farthest point sampling. By focusing on these salient edge points, the paper proposes the novel idea of an "attention-based point cloud edge sampling" (APES) method.The paper investigates two main variants of this idea:- Local-based APES: Uses a neighbor-to-point attention mechanism within local patches to identify edge points with high standard deviation in their normalized correlation maps.- Global-based APES: Uses a point-to-point self-attention mechanism across the whole point cloud to identify points with high values in the global correlation map. Through experiments on ModelNet40 classification and ShapeNet part segmentation, the paper shows that both APES methods are able to effectively sample salient edge points from point clouds and achieve superior performance compared to other sampling techniques.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly sampling salient edge points, guided by attention mechanisms, can lead to improved performance on point cloud analysis tasks. The paper provides both qualitative visualization and quantitative experiments to validate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel point cloud sampling method called Attention-based Point Cloud Edge Sampling (APES). The key ideas are:- APES is inspired by the Canny edge detection algorithm for images. It aims to sample salient points on the outlines/edges of point clouds. - It uses attention mechanisms to compute correlation maps between points. Points with high values in the correlation maps are selected as edge points.- Two variants are proposed: local-based APES using neighbor-to-point attention, and global-based APES using point-to-point self-attention.- APES combines neural network-based learning and mathematical statistics-based direct point selection. It can sample any desired number of points.- Experiments show APES achieves good performance on common point cloud tasks like classification and segmentation. Both quantitative results and visualized sampling patterns demonstrate its effectiveness.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel point cloud sampling method that focuses on edge points, enabled by attention mechanisms. This combines the benefits of learning-based and statistics-based sampling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an attention-based point cloud edge sampling method called APES that selects salient outline points from a point cloud using an attention mechanism inspired by the Canny edge detection algorithm for images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on point cloud sampling and processing:- This paper proposes a novel attention-based point cloud edge sampling (APES) method. Unlike most prior work that uses generative models to produce new point samples, APES selects a subset of representative points directly from the input point cloud. - The idea of focusing on edge/outline points is relatively new and inspired by edge detection in images. Most prior work does not explicitly consider sampling edge points.- Two variants are proposed - local APES uses neighbor-to-point attention to capture local edge information, while global APES uses point-to-point attention to incorporate global context. The combination of local and global information is unique.- For evaluation, the paper compares to random sampling, FPS, and recent learned sampling methods like S-Net, SampleNet, etc. Both quantitative results on classification/segmentation and qualitative visualizations are provided. APES demonstrates superior performance.- The paper connects point cloud processing with classical image processing concepts like Canny edge detection. This cross-pollination of ideas is valuable for the field.- A limitation is that APES changes the point distribution, making later upsampling difficult. This issue of mismatch between sampling and upsampling needs more investigation.Overall, this paper makes good contributions in a less explored area of point cloud sampling. The attention-based edge sampling idea and the blend of mathematical and learned sampling are novel directions worthy of more future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions based on their work:- Improve upsampling methods to better reconstruct features of non-edge points that are discarded during edge sampling. The different point distribution from edge sampling makes conventional interpolation-based upsampling methods less effective. Developing more advanced upsampling modules for point cloud completion/reconstruction could help overcome this limitation.- Explore additional losses during training beyond just the downstream task loss. For example, losses based on edge point supervision could be incorporated.- Apply the edge sampling idea to other point cloud analysis tasks beyond classification and segmentation, such as object detection, completion, registration, etc. Study how focusing on edge points impacts other applications.- Develop variants of the attention-based edge sampling approach, such as using different attention mechanisms or combining both local and global attention.- Explore transforming the edge sampling method into other geometric representations like meshes or voxels.- Analyze the theoretical connections between edge sampling and other point cloud processing operators to better understand its properties.- Study how the proposed sampling method could enable more efficient point cloud processing pipelines by reducing points while maintaining performance.In summary, the main future directions are improving the upsampling process, exploring additional training losses and tasks, developing variants of the edge sampling idea, analyzing it theoretically, and studying its potential for efficient point cloud processing. The key is to build on the core idea of focusing on salient edge points during sampling.
