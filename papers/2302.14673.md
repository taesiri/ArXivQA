# [Attention-based Point Cloud Edge Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14673)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively sample salient points from point clouds, particularly points along edges and contours, in order to improve performance on downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. The key hypothesis is that sampling edge/contour points will capture the overall shape and structure of objects in point clouds better than other sampling methods like random sampling or farthest point sampling. By focusing on these salient edge points, the paper proposes the novel idea of an "attention-based point cloud edge sampling" (APES) method.The paper investigates two main variants of this idea:- Local-based APES: Uses a neighbor-to-point attention mechanism within local patches to identify edge points with high standard deviation in their normalized correlation maps.- Global-based APES: Uses a point-to-point self-attention mechanism across the whole point cloud to identify points with high values in the global correlation map. Through experiments on ModelNet40 classification and ShapeNet part segmentation, the paper shows that both APES methods are able to effectively sample salient edge points from point clouds and achieve superior performance compared to other sampling techniques.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly sampling salient edge points, guided by attention mechanisms, can lead to improved performance on point cloud analysis tasks. The paper provides both qualitative visualization and quantitative experiments to validate this idea.
