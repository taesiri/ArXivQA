# [Attention-based Point Cloud Edge Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14673)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively sample salient points from point clouds, particularly points along edges and contours, in order to improve performance on downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. 

The key hypothesis is that sampling edge/contour points will capture the overall shape and structure of objects in point clouds better than other sampling methods like random sampling or farthest point sampling. By focusing on these salient edge points, the paper proposes the novel idea of an "attention-based point cloud edge sampling" (APES) method.

The paper investigates two main variants of this idea:

- Local-based APES: Uses a neighbor-to-point attention mechanism within local patches to identify edge points with high standard deviation in their normalized correlation maps.

- Global-based APES: Uses a point-to-point self-attention mechanism across the whole point cloud to identify points with high values in the global correlation map. 

Through experiments on ModelNet40 classification and ShapeNet part segmentation, the paper shows that both APES methods are able to effectively sample salient edge points from point clouds and achieve superior performance compared to other sampling techniques.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly sampling salient edge points, guided by attention mechanisms, can lead to improved performance on point cloud analysis tasks. The paper provides both qualitative visualization and quantitative experiments to validate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel point cloud sampling method called Attention-based Point Cloud Edge Sampling (APES). The key ideas are:

- APES is inspired by the Canny edge detection algorithm for images. It aims to sample salient points on the outlines/edges of point clouds. 

- It uses attention mechanisms to compute correlation maps between points. Points with high values in the correlation maps are selected as edge points.

- Two variants are proposed: local-based APES using neighbor-to-point attention, and global-based APES using point-to-point self-attention.

- APES combines neural network-based learning and mathematical statistics-based direct point selection. It can sample any desired number of points.

- Experiments show APES achieves good performance on common point cloud tasks like classification and segmentation. Both quantitative results and visualized sampling patterns demonstrate its effectiveness.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel point cloud sampling method that focuses on edge points, enabled by attention mechanisms. This combines the benefits of learning-based and statistics-based sampling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an attention-based point cloud edge sampling method called APES that selects salient outline points from a point cloud using an attention mechanism inspired by the Canny edge detection algorithm for images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on point cloud sampling and processing:

- This paper proposes a novel attention-based point cloud edge sampling (APES) method. Unlike most prior work that uses generative models to produce new point samples, APES selects a subset of representative points directly from the input point cloud. 

- The idea of focusing on edge/outline points is relatively new and inspired by edge detection in images. Most prior work does not explicitly consider sampling edge points.

- Two variants are proposed - local APES uses neighbor-to-point attention to capture local edge information, while global APES uses point-to-point attention to incorporate global context. The combination of local and global information is unique.

- For evaluation, the paper compares to random sampling, FPS, and recent learned sampling methods like S-Net, SampleNet, etc. Both quantitative results on classification/segmentation and qualitative visualizations are provided. APES demonstrates superior performance.

- The paper connects point cloud processing with classical image processing concepts like Canny edge detection. This cross-pollination of ideas is valuable for the field.

- A limitation is that APES changes the point distribution, making later upsampling difficult. This issue of mismatch between sampling and upsampling needs more investigation.

Overall, this paper makes good contributions in a less explored area of point cloud sampling. The attention-based edge sampling idea and the blend of mathematical and learned sampling are novel directions worthy of more future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions based on their work:

- Improve upsampling methods to better reconstruct features of non-edge points that are discarded during edge sampling. The different point distribution from edge sampling makes conventional interpolation-based upsampling methods less effective. Developing more advanced upsampling modules for point cloud completion/reconstruction could help overcome this limitation.

- Explore additional losses during training beyond just the downstream task loss. For example, losses based on edge point supervision could be incorporated.

- Apply the edge sampling idea to other point cloud analysis tasks beyond classification and segmentation, such as object detection, completion, registration, etc. Study how focusing on edge points impacts other applications.

- Develop variants of the attention-based edge sampling approach, such as using different attention mechanisms or combining both local and global attention.

- Explore transforming the edge sampling method into other geometric representations like meshes or voxels.

- Analyze the theoretical connections between edge sampling and other point cloud processing operators to better understand its properties.

- Study how the proposed sampling method could enable more efficient point cloud processing pipelines by reducing points while maintaining performance.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the upsampling process, exploring additional training losses and tasks, developing variants of the edge sampling idea, analyzing it theoretically, and studying its potential for efficient point cloud processing. The key is to build on the core idea of focusing on salient edge points during sampling.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for sampling representative and informative points from point clouds called Attention-based Point cloud Edge Sampling (APES). APES is inspired by the Canny edge detection algorithm for images, with the key idea of identifying and sampling salient points along the edges and contours of point cloud shapes. The method uses attention mechanisms to compute correlation maps between a point and its local neighborhood or the global point cloud. Points with high standard deviations in their local correlation maps or high sum values in the global correlation map are selected as edge points. 

Two versions of APES are presented - local APES uses neighbor-to-point attention to compute local correlation maps, while global APES uses point-to-point attention for a global correlation map. Experiments on ModelNet40 classification and ShapeNet part segmentation demonstrate that APES effectively samples informative structural points and improves performance on downstream tasks. Both qualitative visualization and quantitative evaluations show APES outperforms other sampling techniques like random sampling and farthest point sampling, especially for very low sample sizes. The work provides a new perspective to leverage edge information for representative point sampling.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an attention-based point cloud edge sampling method (APES) that combines neural network learning and mathematical statistics for sampling representative point subsets. It is inspired by the Canny edge detection algorithm for images. The key idea is to use an attention mechanism to compute correlation maps between points and select salient points along the point cloud outline as edge points. Two variants are presented: 1) Local-based APES uses neighbor-to-point attention within local patches to focus on local edge points. 2) Global-based APES uses point-to-point self-attention and selects points that contribute more to the global correlation map.

The method provides both good performance and interpretable sampling results.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new method for point cloud sampling called Attention-based Point Cloud Edge Sampling (APES). The key points are:

- Point cloud sampling is an important task for processing large point clouds. However, common methods like random sampling and farthest point sampling do not consider sampling salient points like edges.

- The paper proposes to sample "edge points" in the point cloud, similar to how edge detection works for images. This is inspired by the observation that detecting edges is key for the success of CNNs on images. 

- Two variants are proposed: local-based APES uses neighbor-to-point attention to detect edge points based on local patches. Global-based APES uses point-to-point attention on the whole point cloud.

- The attention mechanism helps detect edge points by computing correlation maps between points. Points with high variance in the correlation maps are selected as edge points.

- Experiments on ModelNet40 classification and ShapeNet part segmentation demonstrate superior performance over existing sampling techniques.

In summary, the key novelties are using ideas from image edge detection for point cloud sampling, and leveraging attention mechanisms to detect salient edge points in a learning framework. The goal is to sample more representative and task-relevant points compared to common sampling methods.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Attention-based Point Cloud Edge Sampling (APES), a novel method to sample salient edge points from point clouds. Inspired by Canny edge detection in images, APES leverages attention mechanisms to compute correlation maps between points and select those with high standard deviations as edge points. Two variations are presented: local-based APES uses neighbor-to-point attention within local patches, while global-based APES uses point-to-point self-attention across the entire point cloud.
