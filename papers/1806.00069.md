# [Explaining Explanations: An Overview of Interpretability of Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00069)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions and hypotheses addressed are:

1) What are the key differences between interpretability and explainability in machine learning?

The authors argue that interpretability and explainability have been used interchangeably, but there are important distinctions. Interpretability refers to describing the internals of a system in an understandable way. Explainability refers to being able to summarize the reasons for a system's behavior. The authors suggest interpretability is a prerequisite for explainability.

2) What are suitable evaluation criteria for explanations? 

The authors argue there is no standard evaluation criteria for explanations. They propose classification of evaluation approaches into: application-grounded (real humans/tasks), human-grounded (simplified tasks), and functionally-grounded (no humans, proxy tasks). They argue explanations should allow trading off interpretability and completeness.

3) How can existing explainable AI approaches be taxonomized?

The authors classify approaches into: explaining processing, explaining representations, and explanation-producing systems. They argue these categories are largely disconnected currently and evaluation criteria differs between them. They suggest combining ideas across categories could improve explainability.

In summary, the key research questions focus on definitional distinctions, taxonomy of approaches, and appropriate evaluation criteria for explainable AI systems. The authors aim to help standardize and connect the diverse research in this growing field.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework and methods for explaining the decisions of machine learning models, especially "black box" models like neural networks whose reasoning is opaque. The key ideas are:

- Introducing LIME, a model-agnostic method to explain individual predictions by approximating the black box model locally with an interpretable model.

- Using submodular optimization to select representative instances and explanations to evaluate classifiers globally. 

- Evaluating explanations on measures of trustworthiness and user studies, showing LIME provides useful explanations compared to baselines.

Specifically, LIME is a method to explain the predictions of any classifier or regressor by approximating it locally with a simple linear model that is easy to interpret. It perturbs the input and sees how the predictions change, fitting a linear model to these changes. This allows it to identify the most important features for a particular prediction.

The paper also provides a framework for selecting a small set of representative instances and explanations that capture global model behavior, using submodular optimization. This allows assessing overall model trustworthiness.

Finally, the paper validates the utility of LIME explanations through user studies. It shows that LIME helps users identify the better of two classifiers and that its explanations help improve non-expert users' ability to refine a classifier.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing methods to generate local explanations for any black box model and globally assess models, along with demonstrating these methods are useful for understanding and refining models. The paper establishes both a practical framework for model explanations and an evaluation methodology.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence TL;DR summary:

The paper provides an overview of the emerging field of explanatory artificial intelligence (XAI), including key concepts like interpretability and explainability, a taxonomy of different approaches, a review of related work, and a discussion of open challenges and future research directions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper provides a review and taxonomy of research on explaining and interpreting machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks. Here are a few ways it compares to other work in this field:

- It focuses specifically on explanations for deep neural networks, whereas some other surveys cover interpretability more broadly across machine learning.

- It emphasizes the distinction between interpretability (understanding a model) and explainability (providing explanations). Some other papers use these terms interchangeably. 

- It proposes a novel taxonomy categorizing approaches based on whether they explain processing, representation, or are explanation-producing systems. Other taxonomies have categorized methods differently, like by their relationship to the user.

- It reviews common evaluation approaches like completeness to the original model and human evaluation. It argues for using diverse evaluation metrics matched to the explanation's purpose. 

- It advocates for combining ideas across disciplines to improve explanations. Other surveys tend to focus just on methods within a particular field.

- It highlights open challenges around creating standardized metrics and combining different approaches. Other reviews have focused more narrowly on summarizing methods.

Overall, this paper provides a broad interdisciplinary perspective on deep network interpretability and explainability. Its taxonomy is unique in categorizing the focus of explanations. The discussion of evaluating and combining methods across fields is also distinctive compared to other more siloed reviews.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions in explanatory artificial intelligence:

- Developing methods that combine different explanation techniques across categories to achieve more effective explanations. The current approaches are siloed, focusing on a particular technique. Combining ideas from different areas like machine learning, HCI, cognitive science etc. could lead to better explanations.

- Creating standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks for comparing explanation methods, especially across categories. Currently there is a lack of standardized ways to evaluate and compare different explanation techniques.

- Exploring explanations that provide behavioral extrapolation, build trust, and give insights to improve systems. Explanations should go beyond just describing what happened - they should allow users to anticipate future behavior, establish trust, and provide actionable ways to improve the system.

- Designing neural network architectures and full systems with explainability in mind from the start. Rather than trying to explain black-box models after the fact, architectures could be designed to be more interpretable.

- Developing explanations that preserve privacy and do not reveal sensitive training data. As explanations reveal more about models, there is a risk of exposing private information.

- Understanding what makes an explanation "good enough" for different contexts and audiences. The required complexity and details of an explanation depends on the recipient and intended use case.

- Expanding the techniques to new domains like robotics and cyberphysical systems where explanations are critical for safety and acceptance.

In summary, the main suggestions are to combine ideas across research areas, develop better evaluation methods, focus on explanatory goals beyond description, design transparent systems from the start, preserve privacy, match explanations to the context, and expand domains. The overall vision is of collaborative, standardized, and proactive approaches to build truly explainable AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a survey and analysis of the current state of research on interpretability and explainability of machine learning models, with a focus on deep neural networks. The key points are:

- There is a growing need for AI systems, especially opaque models like deep neural networks, to provide explanations for their decisions and behavior. This is driven by factors such as lack of trust, potential biases, and upcoming regulations.

- The authors define key concepts like interpretability, explainability, and completeness. Interpretability refers to describing a model in understandable terms to humans, while explainability involves the model being able to provide reasons for its decisions. Completeness captures how accurately an explanation describes the system.

- Methods for explaining deep networks focus on explaining processing (e.g. proxy models, salience mapping), explaining representations (roles of layers, neurons, vectors), or designing explanation-producing systems (with attention, disentangled representations, explanation generation). 

- The authors propose a taxonomy that classifies explanation methods based on what they explain - processing, representation, or explanation-producing. They argue for evaluating methods according to interpretability, completeness on critical factors, and using multiple complementary approaches.

- Key gaps identified include lack of standardized evaluation, lack of methods combining multiple explanation categories, and limited work on representing what a network has learned. More collaboration across disciplines is recommended to advance explainable AI.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores the emerging field of explanatory artificial intelligence (XAI), which aims to make complex AI systems like machine learning models more interpretable and explainable. The authors argue that interpretability alone is insufficient and that true explainability requires models to be able to summarize the reasons for their behavior, gain user trust, and produce insights into their decisions. 

The paper provides background on concepts like interpretability, completeness, and different approaches to explaining deep networks focused on processing, representation, or architecture. It surveys related work across areas like explainable planning and story understanding systems. The main contribution is a taxonomy characterizing the focus of explanation methods on processing, representation, or explanation-producing. The authors suggest evaluating methods according to completeness and interpretability, and emphasize combining ideas across categories in the taxonomy to advance explainable systems research. They conclude by asserting the importance of explainability for acceptance of AI systems and pointing to opportunities like integrating processing, representation, and explanation-producing techniques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), a method to explain the predictions of any classifier or regressor in an interpretable manner. The key idea is to approximate the model locally with an interpretable model that is faithful to the original model in the vicinity of the instance being explained. LIME samples instances around the instance to be explained, obtains predictions using the original model, and weighs the instances according to their proximity to the instance being explained. A sparse linear model is then trained on this weighted dataset to serve as a local surrogate that approximates the original model well in the region of interest. The linear model is inherently interpretable and its weighted features can be used to explain individual predictions. By explaining predictions based on local approximations, LIME makes it possible to explain the predictions of any complex black-box model in an interpretable manner.
