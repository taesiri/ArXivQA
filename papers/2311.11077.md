## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other recent work on adapters and modular transfer learning:

- This paper proposes Adapters, a new open-source library for unifying and advancing research on adapters. Other recent libraries with similar goals include OpenDelta, PEFT, and LLM-Adapters. A key distinction of Adapters seems to be the focus on both parameter efficiency and modularity, while other libraries have focused more narrowly on parameter efficiency.

- The paper integrates 10 diverse adapter methods into a single framework. This is more methods than existing libraries like OpenDelta and PEFT which have mainly focused on bottleneck adapters. Integrating many methods makes Adapters more comprehensive.

- The composition blocks for combining adapters in flexible ways appear to be a novel contribution over prior adapter libraries. This seems like an important contribution for fully leveraging the modularity benefits of adapters.

- The benchmarks cover more task types (12) compared to prior adapter papers like LoRA (4 tasks). The model support also covers more models (20) than prior works like PEFT (4 models). This provides a more thorough evaluation.

- The adapter performance results are inline with the state-of-the-art, with adapters approaching or matching full fine-tuning across most tasks. This confirms the efficacy of the implementations.

Overall, the Adapters library seems like an important synthesis and advance over previous adapter libraries. The comprehensive support for methods and models, focus on modularity, and thorough benchmarking help drive the field forward. The code and model contributions will likely be very valuable for researchers and practitioners.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions:

- Integrating more diverse adapter methods into the library, especially very recent architectures.

- Adding support for more model architectures beyond the currently supported Transformers.

- Exploring new composition blocks that allow more complex adapter setups. Examples mentioned include router modules for dynamic routing and more complex aggregation methods.

- Investigating approaches for making composed adapter modules more parameter-efficient. The authors note that composition currently comes at the cost of lower parameter efficiency.

- Studying approaches for making the training and use of composed adapter setups more computationally efficient.

- Adding support for quantization and pruning of adapters to further increase efficiency.

- Exploring approaches for end-to-end neural architecture search to find optimal adapter configurations.
