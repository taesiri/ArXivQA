## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Detecting abusive language online is challenging but important to minimize harm. Existing methods that fine-tune pre-trained language models (PLMs) fail to fully utilize the knowledge within PLMs, limiting accuracy. 

Proposed Solution:
- A novel Deep Prompt Multi-Task Network (DPMN) is proposed that introduces prompt-based learning to better stimulate PLMs' knowledge for abuse detection.
- Two continuous prompt tuning forms are designed - "deep prompt" inserts prompts into each layer of the PLM, "light prompt" inserts into just the first layer.
- A task head using Bi-LSTM and Feedforward Neural Network is proposed as an effective short text classifier.  
- Multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks is used to improve feature representations.

Main Contributions:
- First application of prompt-based learning to abuse language detection. Compares deep vs light prompt tuning.
- Studies impact of different prompt lengths, tuning strategies, and initialization methods.
- Proposes effective Bi-LSTM + FNN task head and multi-task learning framework.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on OLID, SOLID, and AbuseAnalyzer datasets, outperforming previous methods.
- Ablation studies validate contributions of each component of DPMN.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel deep prompt multi-task network to detect abusive language. By utilizing prompt-based learning and multi-task learning, it stimulates more knowledge from PLMs and auxiliary tasks, achieving improved accuracy over current methods.
