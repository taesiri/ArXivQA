# [NAVI: Category-Agnostic Image Collections with High-Quality 3D Shape and   Pose Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09109)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we create a dataset with high-quality 3D shape and pose annotations to enable systematic research progress on 3D reconstruction from casual image captures?Specifically, the authors aim to create a dataset that:- Contains both standard multiview captures and in-the-wild images with varying backgrounds, illuminations and cameras. - Provides near-perfect ground truth 3D shapes and camera poses through precise 2D-3D manual alignment and verification.- Enables accurate derivative annotations like dense pixel correspondences, depth maps and segmentation masks. - Is category-agnostic, containing objects with no category-specific shapes.- Allows for more thorough evaluation and analysis of 3D reconstruction and correspondence techniques compared to existing datasets.The key hypothesis is that a dataset with these properties will advance research on 3D reconstruction from casual images, as current techniques rely on constrained capture conditions and approximate ground truth from reconstruction methods like SfM. The NAVI dataset aims to overcome these limitations.
