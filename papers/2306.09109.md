# [NAVI: Category-Agnostic Image Collections with High-Quality 3D Shape and   Pose Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09109)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we create a dataset with high-quality 3D shape and pose annotations to enable systematic research progress on 3D reconstruction from casual image captures?Specifically, the authors aim to create a dataset that:- Contains both standard multiview captures and in-the-wild images with varying backgrounds, illuminations and cameras. - Provides near-perfect ground truth 3D shapes and camera poses through precise 2D-3D manual alignment and verification.- Enables accurate derivative annotations like dense pixel correspondences, depth maps and segmentation masks. - Is category-agnostic, containing objects with no category-specific shapes.- Allows for more thorough evaluation and analysis of 3D reconstruction and correspondence techniques compared to existing datasets.The key hypothesis is that a dataset with these properties will advance research on 3D reconstruction from casual images, as current techniques rely on constrained capture conditions and approximate ground truth from reconstruction methods like SfM. The NAVI dataset aims to overcome these limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a new dataset called NAVI (Not AVerage Image dataset) of casually captured real-world image collections of objects. The key properties of NAVI are:1) It contains both multiview and in-the-wild image collections of the same objects, with near-perfect ground truth 3D shapes obtained via 3D scanning and camera poses obtained via manual 2D-3D alignment. 2) Accurate derivative annotations like dense correspondences, depths and masks can be obtained from the precise 2D-3D alignments.3) The objects are category-agnostic and casually captured in real settings.- Demonstrating the utility of NAVI for enabling better evaluation and analysis of techniques on three computer vision problems:  - 3D reconstruction from multiview images  - Joint 3D shape and pose estimation from in-the-wild images  - Dense correspondence estimation between image pairs- The high-quality ground truth 3D shapes and poses in NAVI allow for more accurate analysis of techniques on real casual image captures, compared to relying on estimated geometry from traditional SfM pipelines.- The in-the-wild images, accurate poses and shapes in NAVI provide unique opportunities to systematically research joint shape and pose estimation on casual image collections where SfM fails.- The dense correspondences derived from NAVI alignments allow correspondence techniques to be analyzed more thoroughly.In summary, the key contribution is the proposed NAVI dataset that can enable more systematic research on 3D vision problems involving casual real-world image captures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes NAVI, a new dataset of casually captured image collections of objects aligned with high-quality 3D scans, which enables more accurate analysis and evaluation of 3D reconstruction and correspondence techniques compared to existing datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key thoughts on how this paper compares to other related works:- The paper introduces a new dataset called NAVI for evaluating 3D reconstruction and correspondence estimation techniques. It provides multiview and in-the-wild images aligned to high-quality 3D scans, enabling more rigorous evaluation than existing datasets.- For multiview reconstruction, NAVI goes beyond existing real datasets like BlendedMVS and Objectron which rely on rough reconstructions, providing accurate ground truth shapes and poses. This allows for clearer analysis of technique performance.- For in-the-wild reconstruction, NAVI provides the first real image collections with accurate ground truth annotations. Existing datasets are either synthetic or rely on approximate reconstructions. NAVI enables better technique analysis through both rendering and pose metrics.- For correspondence estimation, NAVI provides dense ground truth matches across diverse real image pairs, enabling new evaluation metrics like dense recall. This is unique compared to sparse matches in existing real datasets.- The scale of NAVI is more limited than some large datasets, with only 36 objects and 10K images. But it prioritizes annotation quality over quantity for rigorous benchmarking.- Compared to concurrent works like OmniObject3D, NAVI captures more casual/in-the-wild images and uses manual alignment rather than SfM for higher quality ground truth.Overall, NAVI addresses key limitations of existing datasets to enable more thorough analysis of 3D vision techniques. Its accurate ground truth shapes and poses in real casual environments appear to be a distinguishing factor compared to related benchmark datasets.
