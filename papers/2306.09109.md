# [NAVI: Category-Agnostic Image Collections with High-Quality 3D Shape and   Pose Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09109)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we create a dataset with high-quality 3D shape and pose annotations to enable systematic research progress on 3D reconstruction from casual image captures?

Specifically, the authors aim to create a dataset that:

- Contains both standard multiview captures and in-the-wild images with varying backgrounds, illuminations and cameras. 

- Provides near-perfect ground truth 3D shapes and camera poses through precise 2D-3D manual alignment and verification.

- Enables accurate derivative annotations like dense pixel correspondences, depth maps and segmentation masks. 

- Is category-agnostic, containing objects with no category-specific shapes.

- Allows for more thorough evaluation and analysis of 3D reconstruction and correspondence techniques compared to existing datasets.

The key hypothesis is that a dataset with these properties will advance research on 3D reconstruction from casual images, as current techniques rely on constrained capture conditions and approximate ground truth from reconstruction methods like SfM. The NAVI dataset aims to overcome these limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a new dataset called NAVI (Not AVerage Image dataset) of casually captured real-world image collections of objects. The key properties of NAVI are:

1) It contains both multiview and in-the-wild image collections of the same objects, with near-perfect ground truth 3D shapes obtained via 3D scanning and camera poses obtained via manual 2D-3D alignment. 

2) Accurate derivative annotations like dense correspondences, depths and masks can be obtained from the precise 2D-3D alignments.

3) The objects are category-agnostic and casually captured in real settings.

- Demonstrating the utility of NAVI for enabling better evaluation and analysis of techniques on three computer vision problems:
  - 3D reconstruction from multiview images
  - Joint 3D shape and pose estimation from in-the-wild images
  - Dense correspondence estimation between image pairs

- The high-quality ground truth 3D shapes and poses in NAVI allow for more accurate analysis of techniques on real casual image captures, compared to relying on estimated geometry from traditional SfM pipelines.

- The in-the-wild images, accurate poses and shapes in NAVI provide unique opportunities to systematically research joint shape and pose estimation on casual image collections where SfM fails.

- The dense correspondences derived from NAVI alignments allow correspondence techniques to be analyzed more thoroughly.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed NAVI dataset that can enable more systematic research on 3D vision problems involving casual real-world image captures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes NAVI, a new dataset of casually captured image collections of objects aligned with high-quality 3D scans, which enables more accurate analysis and evaluation of 3D reconstruction and correspondence techniques compared to existing datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key thoughts on how this paper compares to other related works:

- The paper introduces a new dataset called NAVI for evaluating 3D reconstruction and correspondence estimation techniques. It provides multiview and in-the-wild images aligned to high-quality 3D scans, enabling more rigorous evaluation than existing datasets.

- For multiview reconstruction, NAVI goes beyond existing real datasets like BlendedMVS and Objectron which rely on rough reconstructions, providing accurate ground truth shapes and poses. This allows for clearer analysis of technique performance.

- For in-the-wild reconstruction, NAVI provides the first real image collections with accurate ground truth annotations. Existing datasets are either synthetic or rely on approximate reconstructions. NAVI enables better technique analysis through both rendering and pose metrics.

- For correspondence estimation, NAVI provides dense ground truth matches across diverse real image pairs, enabling new evaluation metrics like dense recall. This is unique compared to sparse matches in existing real datasets.

- The scale of NAVI is more limited than some large datasets, with only 36 objects and 10K images. But it prioritizes annotation quality over quantity for rigorous benchmarking.

- Compared to concurrent works like OmniObject3D, NAVI captures more casual/in-the-wild images and uses manual alignment rather than SfM for higher quality ground truth.

Overall, NAVI addresses key limitations of existing datasets to enable more thorough analysis of 3D vision techniques. Its accurate ground truth shapes and poses in real casual environments appear to be a distinguishing factor compared to related benchmark datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Extending the NAVI dataset to include more objects and images, especially video sequences. The authors acknowledge the relatively small scale of NAVI as a limitation, so expanding the dataset could enable more thorough evaluation and analysis.

- Using NAVI for additional computer vision tasks beyond the ones demonstrated in the paper, such as single image 3D reconstruction, depth estimation, segmentation, etc. The precise alignments in NAVI could provide valuable training data.

- Further analysis of 3D reconstruction techniques from in-the-wild images, taking advantage of the ground truth camera poses and shapes. This could reveal insights to guide improvements in simultaneous pose and shape optimization.

- Evaluation and development of correspondence techniques using the dense pixel correspondences available in NAVI. The correspondence coverage metrics could help improve feature detection and matching.

- Finetuning existing methods on the NAVI dataset and object-centric imagery. The correspondence results suggest finetuning could yield better performance on objects.

- Exploring the use of NAVI for video-based 3D reconstruction, building on top of the image collections.

In summary, the authors suggest expanding the scale and tasks covered in NAVI, and leveraging the precise alignments it provides for thorough analysis and development of 3D reconstruction, correspondence, and other vision techniques. The in-the-wild images are a unique aspect that enables research on challenging real-world data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces NAVI, a new dataset for 3D reconstruction and correspondence estimation tasks. NAVI contains two types of image collections - multiview captures and in-the-wild internet images - for a set of 36 objects scanned in 3D. Each image is manually aligned to the 3D scan, providing accurate ground truth shape, pose, correspondences, and other annotations. The key advantages of NAVI are the precise alignments and challenging in-the-wild images, enabling more thorough evaluation than existing datasets based on synthetic data or reconstructed geometry. The authors demonstrate NAVI's utility by benchmarking techniques for multiview 3D reconstruction, joint 3D and pose estimation from wild images, and correspondence matching. They show that NAVI GT poses improve multiview reconstruction and reveal limitations of different wild image methods. NAVI correspondences differentiate matcher performance on multiview vs. wild image pairs and enable a new dense recall metric. Overall, NAVI facilitates systematic research on reconstruction and correspondence problems using real casually captured images.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces NAVI, a new dataset for multiview 3D reconstruction and correspondence estimation tasks. The key distinction of NAVI is that it provides real-world image collections of objects captured in casual settings, along with high-quality 3D scans of the objects and near-perfect annotations of camera poses and intrinsics via manual 2D-3D alignment. This enables accurate ground truth 3D shapes, poses, dense correspondences, depths and segmentations. NAVI contains two types of image collections - standard multiview captures and more challenging in-the-wild captures with varying backgrounds, cameras and lighting. 

The authors demonstrate NAVI's utility on three core problems - 3D reconstruction from multiview images, 3D estimation from in-the-wild collections, and pixel correspondence estimation. For each problem, they benchmark recent techniques and conduct analysis that was not previously possible without a dataset like NAVI. Overall, the precise alignments and challenging in-the-wild captures in NAVI enable more thorough evaluation and analysis on multiview 3D reconstruction and correspondence tasks. The paper concludes that NAVI can drive systematic progress on these fundamental vision problems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new dataset called NAVI (Not AVerage Image dataset) for evaluating 3D object reconstruction and correspondence estimation techniques. The key idea is to capture real-world image collections of objects along with high-quality 3D scans of the same objects. Using an interactive alignment tool, they obtain precise alignments between the 2D images and 3D models, providing near ground-truth camera poses and shapes. The dataset contains two types of image collections - standard multiview captures around an object and unconstrained "in-the-wild" captures with varying backgrounds, cameras, and lighting. These precise 2D-3D alignments allow them to generate additional annotations like pixel correspondences, depth maps, and segmentation masks. They demonstrate the utility of the NAVI dataset on three computer vision tasks - 3D reconstruction from multiview images, joint pose and shape estimation from in-the-wild images, and pixel correspondence estimation. The accurate alignments and derivative annotations in NAVI enable more thorough evaluation and analysis on these tasks compared to existing datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper introduces a new dataset called NAVI (Not AVerage Image dataset) to enable systematic research progress on 3D reconstruction from casual image captures. Specifically, the paper addresses the following key problems and questions:

1. Current 3D reconstruction techniques make assumptions like having near-perfect camera poses readily available from SfM pipelines. This limits the input image collections to have high-quality images with sufficient number of views for SfM to work. The paper aims to go beyond these restrictions by providing accurate 3D shapes and poses even for casual in-the-wild image collections where SfM fails.

2. There is a lack of suitable datasets with in-the-wild image collections to develop and evaluate joint camera and shape estimation techniques. Existing datasets are either synthetic or provide only rough alignments or shapes. NAVI provides accurate 3D shapes and poses for in-the-wild image collections to enable research in this direction. 

3. Dense pixel correspondences are hard to obtain for real image pairs. NAVI provides accurate dense correspondences derived from 2D-3D alignments to enable correspondence research.

4. Current datasets couple the image capture process, 3D shape and annotation quality. NAVI decouples them by using professional 3D scans and manual alignments to obtain precise annotations even for casually captured images.

5. How do the near-perfect alignments in NAVI compare against standard SfM techniques like COLMAP on tasks like novel view synthesis? Are the poses good enough to analyze shape reconstruction techniques independent of pose errors?

6. How do different recent techniques perform on joint camera and shape estimation from in-the-wild images? How robust are they to noise in camera initialization?

7. How do different correspondence techniques compare on multiview vs in-the-wild image pairs? What is the coverage of correspondences predicted by these techniques?

In summary, NAVI aims to push the boundaries of 3D vision research by providing accurate alignments for casual real-world image collections beyond the constraints of existing datasets. The paper analyzes the usefulness of NAVI for tasks like multiview 3D reconstruction, joint shape and pose estimation from in-the-wild images, and correspondence estimation.
