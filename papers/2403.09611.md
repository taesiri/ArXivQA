# [MM1: Methods, Analysis &amp; Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Building performant Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that can process both visual and textual data is an important open research problem. However, details on architecture choices and training procedures are often not shared.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors perform comprehensive ablations on three axes - architecture, data and training procedure - to identify key components for building a strong MLLM.

- For architecture, they find image resolution and encoder capacity are most important, while the vision-language connector design has negligible impact. 

- For data, a careful mixture of caption, interleaved and text-only data is crucial, with each providing complementary benefits.

- These insights are used to develop MM1, a family of MLLMs up to 30B parameters, which combines a strong image encoder, a basic connector, and a diverse data mixture.

Main Contributions:
- Thorough ablations and analyses to identify key lessons for MLLM modeling and data choices, spanning pre-training and fine-tuning.

- A recipe to train performant MLLMs, applied to build MM1 models that achieve state-of-the-art few-shot results and competitive benchmark performance. 

- Qualitative examples showing MM1's abilities for multi-image reasoning, instruction following, and in-context prediction.

- The presented methodology and insights aim to inform continued progress on MLLMs beyond specific architectures.
