# [BiPhone: Modeling Inter Language Phonetic Influences in Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is how to make natural language understanding (NLU) models robust to the phonetic influences of a user's native language (L1) on their second language (L2) in written text. The key hypothesis is that current state-of-the-art NLU models are not robust to such L1-influenced phonetic variations in L2 text. The paper aims to demonstrate this drop in performance, and propose techniques to improve robustness.In particular, the paper hypothesizes that:1. Mining phoneme confusions across languages and generating synthetic spelling corruptions accordingly can simulate plausible L1-influenced errors in L2 text.2. Introducing such synthetic spelling corruptions into existing benchmarks will show a drop in performance of current NLU models. 3. Additional pre-training focused on phonetic information can help improve model robustness to such errors without requiring access to real L1-influenced noisy text data.The overall goal is to bring attention to this robustness issue for NLU models dealing with users from diverse language backgrounds, and drive further research into handling such phonetic influences in text.
