# [HyperMoE: Towards Better Mixture of Experts via Transferring Among   Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Mixture of Experts (MoE) models route inputs to different experts to improve capacity and efficiency. However, there is a tradeoff between performance and sparsity - using more experts improves performance but reduces sparsity.
- This paper aims to improve expert knowledge availability while maintaining sparsity in MoE models. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose HyperMoE, a novel MoE framework built on hypernetworks that allows knowledge transfer between experts.
- Hypernetworks can capture cross-expert information and generate expert-specific modules (HyperExperts) conditioned on expert selection information. 
- The HyperExperts serve as supplementary information for the selected experts, enhancing their knowledge.

Key Contributions:
- A new HyperMoE architecture with conditional expert generation using hypernetworks and selection embeddings.
- Achieves expert knowledge transfer to improve availability while maintaining sparse expert selection.
- Significantly outperforms strong MoE baselines like Switch Transformer across diverse NLP tasks.
- Analysis shows selection embeddings encode relevant information to generate beneficial HyperExperts for selected experts.
- First work exploring knowledge transfer in MoE models using hypernetworks.

In summary, the paper proposes HyperMoE to improve MoE performance via expert knowledge transfer while preserving sparsity. Experiments across various datasets validate the effectiveness of this novel architecture and knowledge transfer approach for MoE models.
