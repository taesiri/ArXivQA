# Learning video embedding space with Natural Language Supervision

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we map video embedding space to natural language in order to enable text-based video retrieval?The key hypotheses are:- By first extracting visual features from video frames using a pre-trained CNN, and then encoding those features through the CLIP model, videos can be projected into the same joint embedding space as text. - Adding temporal modeling with LSTM or Transformer architectures on top of the frame-level CLIP encodings can capture temporal relationships and improve video classification performance.- Mapping videos into the joint text-image embedding space will enable text-based video retrieval, where videos semantically related to a textual query can be efficiently retrieved.So in summary, the main research direction is developing an effective approach to project videos into a joint embedding space with text to enable text-based video retrieval. The key hypotheses are that using CLIP plus temporal modeling can achieve this, and that this joint embedding will improve retrieval performance compared to relying purely on metadata.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a novel approach to map video embedding space to natural language by first extracting visual features from video frames using a CNN, and then encoding the features with CLIP to get video embeddings that lie in the joint embedding space with text.- Evaluating this approach on UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmark datasets and showing state-of-the-art performance for video retrieval based on natural language queries. - Extending the image-based CLIP model to video by adding LSTM/Transformer modules to model temporal relationships between frames and fuse them into a single embedding. This gave much better performance on action recognition compared to baseline approaches.- Demonstrating the capability of the model for text-based video retrieval on Kinetics and VIRAT datasets, where it can retrieve relevant videos for complex textual queries.So in summary, the main contribution is developing a video embedding space aligned with natural language supervision using CLIP, and showing its effectiveness for tasks like action recognition and text-based video retrieval. The temporal fusion modules allow better video understanding compared to simple extensions of image CLIP.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage approach to map video embeddings to natural language by first extracting visual features from video frames using a CNN and then encoding the features with CLIP to align the video and text in a joint embedding space for cross-modal video retrieval.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on learning joint embeddings of vision and language:- The paper proposes using CLIP to extract image features from video frames, then applying LSTM/Transformer models on top to learn joint embeddings of videos and text. This extends CLIP from images to videos. Other works like ActBERT have also extended BERT to videos.- For learning joint embeddings, the paper relies on supervised contrastive learning between matched video-text pairs. Other approaches like CBT also learn by contrasting matched video-text pairs. However, some works like ClipBERT and FILIP learn alignments in a self-supervised way without matched pairs.- The paper evaluates on action recognition and video retrieval tasks. Other works have also evaluated on tasks like captioning and visual question answering. The paper shows strong video retrieval results.- The paper uses standard video datasets like Kinetics and HMDB51. Some other works have used larger datasets like HowTo100M or Conceptual Captions. The larger datasets can help learn more general video representations. - For temporal modeling, the paper compares LSTM vs Transformer which are standard approaches. Other works have explored different ways to integrate temporal information like 3D convnets or temporal attention. - The paper builds on top of the strong CLIP image features. Some other works like VideoBERT have built video models directly from scratch rather than starting from a pretrained image model.Overall the paper demonstrates a simple and effective way to extend CLIP to videos for retrieval. But other works have explored different model architectures, learning methods, datasets, and tasks for video-text modeling.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Extend the current work to the full Kinetics 400/700 dataset with all 400/700 classes. The current work was only done on 25 classes due to limited compute resources. Evaluating on the full dataset could further validate the performance.- Test the models on more complex video datasets like MSR Action 3D and RareAct. These contain unusual actions not in the training data, which would better evaluate the generalization ability and open set recognition capabilities of the models. - Explore adversarial attacks like text patching and adversarial perturbations on the CLIP models. This could reveal insights into the robustness and failure modes of the current approaches.- Develop captioning or subtitling capabilities by predicting actions frame-by-frame in a video using the LSTM/Transformer models. - Improve video retrieval by exploring hyperparameters like video length rather than using fixed 100 frames per video.- Visualize the embedding spaces and adversarial spaces to better understand what the models are learning and their failure modes.- Explore zero-shot transfer, natural language supervision, and open set recognition more thoroughly to improve generalizability.So in summary, the main future directions are around model generalization, robustness, explainability, and video understanding capabilities beyond classification. Testing on more diverse and unusual data as well as visualizing the models seem to be key next steps suggested.
