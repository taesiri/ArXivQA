# [$L^*LM$: Learning Automata from Examples using Natural Language Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07051)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing algorithms can learn complex tasks from expert demonstrations, but the resulting models are not easily amenable to formal analysis or compositional reuse. 
- Formal specifications like deterministic finite automata (DFAs) have well-defined semantics for analysis and composition, but are difficult to learn from limited data.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce L*LM, an algorithm to learn DFAs from a combination of natural language descriptions, labeled examples, and expert demonstrations. 
- Leverage large language models (LLMs) to answer membership queries about whether strings belong to the target DFA language. Use constrained decoding to restrict LLM responses and avoid arbitrary code execution.
- Complement the LLM's knowledge using the DISS algorithm to identify new labeled examples from demonstrations that help learn the DFA.  

Key Contributions:
- Novel method to extract DFAs from LLMs using only simple membership queries, avoiding risks from arbitrary code execution.
- Empirical demonstration that complementing demonstrations with natural language improves DFA learning data efficiency. 
- Analysis highlighting the importance of allowing LLMs to respond "unsure" to avoid hallucinations.
- Prototype L*LM implementation compatible with various LLM backends.

The key insight is to leverage LLMs to answer simpler membership queries rather than directly outputting complex DFAs. Natural language improves learning while allowing unsure responses and analyzing demonstrations avoids LLM hallucinations. Together this enables sample-efficient learning of verifiable and reusable DFA task specifications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces $L^*LM$, a novel algorithm for learning deterministic finite automata from a combination of natural language, labeled examples, and expert demonstrations in a Markov decision process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose a new algorithm called L^*LM for learning deterministic finite automata (DFAs) from a combination of natural language, labeled examples, and expert demonstrations. 

2) L^*LM leverages large language models (LLMs) to answer membership queries about the underlying task during the DFA learning process. This allows incorporating knowledge from the LLM's understanding of natural language.

3) The authors provide an implementation of L^*LM and empirically show that:
- Including a natural language task description improves DFA learnability over using demonstrations alone 
- Allowing the LLM to respond "unsure" avoids harmful hallucinations and improves performance
- More LLM queries leads to better DFA learning
- Their method outperforms the standard L* algorithm for active DFA learning

In summary, the main contribution is the L^*LM algorithm for improved, multi-modal DFA learning using LLMs to answer membership queries based on a natural language task description.

The paper focuses on learning formal specifications, specifically deterministic finite automata (DFAs), from a combination of natural language descriptions, labeled examples, and expert demonstrations in Markov Decision Processes. Key aspects include using large language models to answer membership queries, allowing the language model to respond "unsure", and combining this with an algorithm called Demonstration Informed Specification Search (DISS) to incorporate the demonstrations. The goal is multi-modal learning of structured specifications. Relevant fields include grammatical inference, knowledge distillation from language models, and multi-modal learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper mentions that allowing the language model to respond "unsure" improves performance. Can you elaborate on why this is the case? What specifically does allowing "unsure" responses enable compared to forcing a yes/no response?

2) How does the proposed method for incorporating demonstrations compare to more traditional approaches like inverse reinforcement learning? What are the tradeoffs?

3) What modifications would need to be made to the method to handle more complex DFAs or other types of automata beyond DFAs? What are the computational challenges there? 

4) The paper emphasizes using membership queries rather than full program synthesis from the language model. Can you discuss the motivation behind this choice and why it leads to better performance? 

5) What theoretical guarantees does the proposed method provide in terms of consistency, sample complexity, computational complexity etc. compared to classic methods like L*?

6) How sensitive is the method to the specific choice of language model? Have you investigated performance with different model sizes, architectures etc?

7) The paper studies combining language and demonstrations as modalities. What other modalities could be incorporated and how might the method need to change?

8) What types of prompts lead to better knowledge extraction from the language model? Have you studied ways to optimize or improve the prompting?  

9) How does the performance scale with the complexity of the underlying DFA? At what point does the method start to struggle?

10) Have you considered any methods to handle distribution shift between the demonstrations and deployment environment? How could the approach be made more robust?
