# [Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central hypothesis of this paper seems to be:

Dense retrieval models require large amounts of relevance labeled data for training, which may not always be available. The authors propose an alternative approach called HyDE that does not require relevance labels and can work in a zero-shot setting by utilizing a generative language model and unsupervised contrastive document encoder. 

Specifically, the key hypothesis appears to be that decomposing dense retrieval into a generative task (generating hypothetical relevant documents with an LM) and a similarity task (encoding documents with a contrastive encoder) can allow effective zero-shot retrieval without needing relevance supervision. The generative LM can capture relevance patterns by generating example documents, while the contrastive encoder maps documents into a shared space where similarity indicates relevance.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed HyDE approach can enable precise zero-shot dense retrieval without requiring relevance labels, by splitting the task between a generative LM and unsupervised contrastive encoder. The authors aim to show this works well across diverse tasks and languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new method called HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) for zero-shot dense retrieval that does not require any relevance labels or supervision. 

Specifically, the key ideas of HyDE seem to be:

- It uses an instruction-following language model (e.g. InstructGPT) to generate a "hypothetical" document that captures relevance patterns for a given query, even though this document is not real and may contain false details. 

- It then encodes this hypothetical document using an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g. Contriever) to get a document embedding vector. The encoder serves as a "lossy compressor" to filter out incorrect details. 

- This document vector is then used to retrieve the most similar real documents from the corpus based on vector similarity, leveraging the document-document similarities learned by the encoder.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing this method to decompose dense retrieval into a generative relevance modeling task and a document similarity encoding task, avoiding the need for explicit relevance supervision. The results show HyDE can significantly outperform previous unsupervised methods like Contriever across various tasks and languages.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper: 

The paper proposes a new zero-shot dense retrieval method called HyDE that pivots through hypothetical document embeddings generated by an instruction-following language model to enable effective retrieval without any relevance labels.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are the key points on how this paper compares to other related work in zero-shot dense retrieval:

- This paper tackles the challenging problem of fully zero-shot dense retrieval where no relevance labels are available for training. Most prior work assumes access to some labeled data like MS-MARCO for training. 

- The proposed HyDE method is completely unsupervised, without fine-tuning or training any models. It uses an instruction-following LM like GPT-3 and a contrastive encoder like Contriever. Both models are used out-of-the-box without modification.

- HyDE pivots through hypothetical documents generated by the LM to create query embeddings. It offloads relevance modeling to the powerful generative capabilities of LLMs. This is a novel way of approaching zero-shot retrieval.

- Other methods like TART require fine-tuning the encoders with task instructions. HyDE keeps the encoder fixed and handles instructions only through the LM.

- HyDE performs retrieval purely based on document similarity without directly modeling query-document scores. The generation and encoding steps essentially cast retrieval as NLU and NLG tasks.

- HyDE doesn't require any custom training, indices or search algorithms. It can leverage standard dense retrieval pipelines based on MIPS.

- In contrast, generative retrieval methods like DSI and SEAL require training generative models on relevance data and may need custom search indices.

- Experiments show HyDE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art like Contriever on diverse tasks and languages. It is competitive with supervised models.

In summary, HyDE proposes a novel unsupervised dense retrieval approach using LLMs and contrastive learning. It demonstrates strong zero-shot performance without requiring relevance labels or model training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring ambiguous queries and result diversification. The current HyDE model assumes queries are unambiguous. The authors suggest studying how HyDE could handle ambiguous queries and provide diverse results.

- Generalizing to more complex tasks like multi-hop question answering and conversational search. The authors are interested in extending the HyDE paradigm beyond simple retrieval to more interactive settings.

- Studying the balance between generative model and retriever over time. The authors propose HyDE could be used when launching a new search system, then gradually transition to a trained retriever. More analysis is needed on this tradeoff.

- Applying HyDE to specialized domains and instructions. The authors found performance gaps for certain domains like finance and recommend exploring more tailored instructions. 

- Scaling to more languages. The authors found gaps between HyDE and supervised models for non-English retrieval and suggest this is due to limitations in pretraining and instruction tuning.

- Analyzing what makes generated docs useful. The authors suggest analyzing the generated hypothetical documents themselves to understand what makes them capture relevance without being factually accurate.

- Comparing to other unsupervised methods like self-supervised pretraining. The authors suggest comparing HyDE to other unsupervised representation learning techniques.

In summary, key directions are improving HyDE's capabilities, scaling it, and better understanding the interplay and tradeoffs between its generative and retrieval components. The authors are interested in extending HyDE's zero-shot paradigm more broadly in information retrieval.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) for zero-shot dense retrieval that does not require any relevance labels or training. The method uses an instruction-following language model like GPT-3 to generate a hypothetical relevant document for a query. This hypothetical document captures patterns of relevance but may contain factual errors. The document is encoded by an unsupervised contrastively trained encoder like Contriever to get a vector representation. This vector identifies a neighborhood of similar real documents in the corpus based on vector similarity. So the generative model captures relevance while the encoder grounds it to retrieve real documents. Experiments show HyDE significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods like Contriever across diverse tasks and languages. It is competitive with fine-tuned supervised models without using any relevance data. The key insight is decomposing retrieval into language modeling tasks rather than explicitly modeling relevance scores.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for zero-shot dense retrieval called HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings). The key idea is to separate the retrieval task into two components - a generative language model that produces hypothetical relevant documents given a query, and a contrastive encoder that encodes documents into embeddings. 

Specifically, for a given query, the language model generates a hypothetical document that aims to capture relevance patterns without containing real factual content. This document is encoded by the contrastive encoder into a dense vector. Retrieval is then performed by finding actual documents with similar embeddings to this hypothetical document vector. Experiments across diverse tasks and languages show HyDE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised methods like Contriever, and is competitive with supervised fine-tuned models. A key benefit is that HyDE requires no relevance labels for training.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for zero-shot dense retrieval called HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings). The key idea is to decompose dense retrieval into two tasks - a generative task performed by an instruction-following language model like GPT-3, and a document similarity task performed by a contrastively trained encoder like Contriever. Given a query, the instruction-following LM generates a hypothetical document that captures relevance but may contain factual errors. This document is encoded by the contrastive encoder into a vector representing the query. Retrieval is performed by finding the most similar real documents to this query vector using inner product search. The generative model captures relevance while the encoder grounds the query to the actual corpus. This allows effective retrieval without any relevance labels or query/document access during training.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the difficulty of creating effective fully zero-shot dense retrieval systems when no relevance labels are available. Some key points:

- Dense retrieval has been shown effective for tasks like web search, QA, fact verification, but remains challenging in a zero-shot setting without relevance labels for training. 

- The paper proposes a new approach called HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) that pivots through a hypothetical document generated by an instruction-following language model. 

- For a given query, HyDE first instructs the language model to generate a hypothetical relevant document. This captures relevance patterns but may contain false details.

- Then a contrastive encoder maps this document to an embedding vector, which identifies a neighborhood of similar real documents in the corpus. The encoder filters out incorrect details.

- Experiments show HyDE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art on 11 diverse query sets. It's comparable to fine-tuned supervised models without using any relevance labels.

- The key insight is decomposing retrieval into language understanding/generation rather than learning to model relevance scores. This removes the need for relevance supervision.

So in summary, the paper is addressing the challenge of building effective zero-shot dense retrieval systems without any relevance labels, by using a generative model to capture relevance and filtering via a contrastive encoder.
