# [Science Checker Reloaded: A Bidirectional Paradigm for Transparency and   Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing scientific information retrieval systems have limitations in handling long, dense documents:
    - Sparse retrieval methods like BM25 have vocabulary gaps and semantic divergence issues
    - Dense retrieval methods with vector databases and LLMs have high computational costs, scalability issues, and lack of interpretability
    - LLM-based generative QA systems can hallucinate information or provide outdated knowledge
- There is a need for transparent, logical, and industrializable scientific QA systems

Proposed Solution:
- A two-block approach
    - Block 1: Sparse retrieval with ontology-based query expansion to address vocabulary gaps and improve document retrieval 
    - Block 2: Hybrid retrieval with iterative deepening on retrieved documents to provide detailed answers - uses sparse + iterative dense multihop retrieval, with intermediate results provided to user at each stage

Key Contributions:
- Eliminates inefficient processes for better efficiency and cost-awareness  
- Enables understanding of system's reasoning via intermediate results at each pipeline stage
- Allows user interaction to fact-check system and validate reasoning
- Document retrieval evaluation shows it outperforms dense LLM-based methods
- Aims to develop industrializable system that can be adapted to different deployment contexts
- Focuses on interpretability, transparency and logical reasoning to advance scientific QA

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem, proposed solution, evaluations, and contributions in a detailed yet concise manner for full human understanding. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
