## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on a quick skim of the LaTeX source code provided, some potential keywords or key terms associated with this paper include:

- Mathematics/math formulas (evidenced by the numerous math and symbols commands like \usepackage{amsmath}, \def\vzero{{\bm{0}}}, etc.)

- Machine learning (terms like \train, \valid, \test datasets)  

- Probability and statistics (terms like \E for expected value, \Var for variance, \KL for Kullback-Leibler divergence)

- Neural networks (terms like \softmax, \sigmoid, \rect for rectified linear units)

- Error analysis (\standarderror)

- Optimization (terms like \argmax, \argmin for maximization/minimization)

The paper seems to involve mathematical and statistical analysis, likely for a machine learning model or approach. More specifics would require seeing the actual manuscript content, but the LaTeX defines suggest it covers those general topics.
