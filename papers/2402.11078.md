# [Model Editing by Pure Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11078)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning is commonly dismissed as an ineffective approach for model editing due to poor performance compared to more specialized methods. However, fine-tuning is simple, model-agnostic, and can leverage advances in standard training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows that pure fine-tuning can be viable for model editing by making two key modifications:
  1) Optimizing the conditional likelihood rather than the full likelihood to focus training and minimize changes.
  2) Augmenting the edit data with random paraphrases and facts to encourage generalization and locality.

Key Contributions:  
- The paper challenges the assumption that fine-tuning performs poorly for model editing.
- With the above two modifications, fine-tuning matches or exceeds specialized model editors on edit score metrics in experiments on the ZsRE and CounterFact datasets. 
- The results support the viability of pure fine-tuning as a model editor, with the advantages of simplicity and compatibility with standard training techniques.
- The work highlights the potential for model editing to become a more seamless part of standard LLM training flows.

In summary, the paper makes a case for revisiting fine-tuning as a competitive approach for model editing, through slight modifications to the likelihood objective and data augmentation. The experiments demonstrate edits scores on par with state-of-the-art methods while retaining simplicity and compatibility with ongoing advances.
