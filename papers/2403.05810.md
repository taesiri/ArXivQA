# [Recurrent Aligned Network for Generalized Pedestrian Trajectory   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05810)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for applications like autonomous driving, but suffers from a domain shift problem - models trained on one dataset (domain) fail to generalize well to other unseen domains.
- Prior work has tried domain adaptation, but it requires access to target domain data which is impractical. Instead, the paper studies a new problem - "generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction" - to predict trajectories by generalizing from source to unseen target domains without any target domain data.

Method:
- Proposes a Recurrent Aligned Network (RAN) architecture tailored for this problem. It has two main components:
   1) A recurrent alignment module with a novel recurrent alignment strategy and loss to align source domains at both time-state and time-sequence levels to learn domain invariant features.
   2) A pre-aligned representation module to also consider social interactions during alignment instead of just trajectories.
- Together these modules learn to extract domain-invariant generalized trajectory features for better generalization.

Contributions:
- Defines and benchmarks a new problem setting - generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction.
- Proposes a tailored RAN architecture with recurrent alignment for this problem to align source domains and interactions for superior cross-domain generalization capability.
- Extensive experiments on 3 datasets capturing different domains show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of RAN for generalizing across varied domains without any target domain data access.

The paper makes important contributions in tackling the very practical domain shift issue faced in trajectory prediction using the idea of domain generalization through a novel recurrent feature alignment strategy.
