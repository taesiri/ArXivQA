# [Differentially Private Online Federated Learning with Correlated Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16542)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on online federated learning (OFL), where a server coordinates multiple distributed learners to train a model in real-time using streaming non-iid data from clients. OFL is useful for applications requiring instant decision-making, such as hospital networks. However, a key concern is privacy leakage from the continuously released models. Differential privacy (DP) is a standard technique to preserve privacy, but most works study DP with independent noise injection for offline learning. Using independent noise for online learning reduces utility. Recent works use temporally correlated noise for online learning, but only consider single-machine settings, not OFL.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a DP algorithm for OFL using temporally correlated noise constructed via matrix factorization. To address challenges from DP noise and streaming non-iid data, a perturbed iterate analysis is developed to control the impact of noise on utility. Specifically, the actual variable is decomposed into a virtual variable that subtracts out the DP noise component. The virtual variable, containing gradient information free of DP noise, is analyzed to quantify the effect of noise. Moreover, drift errors caused by local updates are managed under a quasi-strong convexity condition.  

Main Contributions:
- Extends temporally correlated noise techniques from single-machine to federated learning settings
- Develops perturbed iterate analysis to control impact of DP noise and local updates on utility
- Establishes dynamic regret bound that explicitly shows trade-off between utility, privacy parameters, and environment changes
- Removes dependence on environment changes under strong convexity and proves sub-linear static regret 
- Validates efficacy of proposed OFL algorithm on logistic regression problems

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in designing DP algorithms for OFL that use correlated noise to improve utility-privacy trade-offs. The analysis quantifies the impact of key factors and demonstrates advantages over independent noise injection.
