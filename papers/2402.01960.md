# [Calibrated Uncertainty Quantification for Operator Learning via   Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01960)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for operator learning, which is used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in various scientific applications. Key issues with existing UQ methods are: (1) Lack of function-space coverage rather than just point estimates; (2) Lack of distribution-free calibration guarantees - most rely on Gaussian assumptions; (3) Lack of scalability compared to Bayesian approaches. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an Uncertainty-Quantified Neural Operator (UQNO) framework that provides a finite-sample, distribution-free, functionally calibrated conformal prediction approach. The key ideas are:

(1) Parameterize uncertainty set as a heterogeneous pointwise ball centered at a base neural operator prediction, with radius determined by a learned "residual operator". 

(2) Train the residual operator with a generalized quantile loss to give good heuristic uncertainty estimates. 

(3) Calibrate the prediction sets using conformal prediction with a nonconformity score based on normalized residual. This yields a PAC guarantee on the coverage rate over the function domain.

Main Contributions:

(1) A function-space formulation of UQ for operator learning using conformal prediction. Enables simultaneous uncertainty estimates for all points in the domain.

(2) A distribution-free, finite-sample calibration guarantee on the percentage of points in the domain that will fall in the predicted uncertainty sets.

(3) Empirical demonstration of calibrated coverage and efficient uncertainty bands on a 2D Darcy flow and a 3D car surface pressure prediction task. On the 3D task, the proposed method met the 98% target calibration percentage unlike other baselines.

In summary, the paper introduces a principled and scalable approach to uncertainty quantification in operator learning that provides functionally calibrated uncertainty bands with theoretical guarantees.
