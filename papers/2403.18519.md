# [Improving Line Search Methods for Large Scale Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Selecting appropriate optimization algorithms and learning rates for training neural networks is difficult and requires extensive expertise and computation. 
- Existing line search methods like Stochastic Line Search (SLS) perform well on small datasets and models, but fail during large-scale training.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Automated Large Scale ADAM Line Search (ALSALS), an enhanced line search algorithm integrated with Adam's momentum term for efficient large-scale training.

- ALSALS modifies the Armijo line search criterion to approximate the change in loss when taking a step in the Adam direction instead of just the gradient direction. This enables it to work reliably with Adam's momentum term.

- ALSALS also introduces adjustments to handle cases where the loss increases after a step, which can happen with momentum but not in classical line search.

Contributions:
- ALSALS outperforms both fine-tuned Adam and previous SLS method in terms of loss and accuracy over multiple NLP and computer vision tasks.

- It is the first automated line search technique capable of reliably training large-scale models like GPT-2, where previous methods failed.

- Unlike other methods, ALSALS requires no manual tuning of learning rates or scheduling.

- The algorithm is published as an easy-to-use optimizer in PyTorch for reproducibility and accessibility.

In summary, the paper presents a robust and tunable-free line search optimizer that advances the state-of-the-art in large-scale deep learning optimization. The proposed ALSALS method consistently improves efficiency and performance across domains.
