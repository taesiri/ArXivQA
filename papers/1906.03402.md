# [Effective Use of Variational Embedding Capacity in Expressive End-to-End   Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03402)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses addressed are:

1) Can a unified framework based on "embedding capacity" (representational mutual information between embeddings and data) be used to analyze and configure latent variable models for speech synthesis?

2) Can modifying the variational posterior in these models to match the true posterior enable effective style/prosody transfer and high-quality prior samples from a single model?

3) Can hierarchical decomposition of embedding capacity allow separate control over the fidelity and variability of transfer when using these models?

In more detail:

- The authors propose using embedding capacity, formalized as representational mutual information, as a unified way to analyze different latent variable models for speech synthesis. They show it correlates with reconstruction quality/similarity to references.

- They modify the variational posterior to add dependencies on text/speaker, matching the true posterior's form. This enables high-fidelity prosody/style transfer and natural prior samples from the same model across a range of capacities.

- A hierarchical decomposition of capacity is introduced. By controlling the capacity allocated to different subsets of latents, they can trade off between transfer fidelity vs variability when sampling.

So in summary, the main hypotheses are around using capacity as a unified framework for these models, the benefits of matching the true posterior, and the advantages of hierarchical capacity decomposition. The experiments aim to demonstrate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes using embedding capacity (representational mutual information) as a unified framework for analyzing and comparing latent variable models for speech synthesis. This allows evaluating the tradeoffs between precision and generality in heuristic models as well as directly controlling capacity in variational models.

2. It shows that modifying the variational posterior in conditional VAEs to match the true posterior allows the same model to be used effectively for high-precision prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and generating natural sounding prior samples. 

3. For multi-speaker models, matching the posterior to the true form helps preserve speaker identity during inter-speaker prosody transfer and when sampling from the prior.

4. It introduces a method to hierarchically decompose capacity across two sets of latents, allowing part of the variation to be specified while sampling the rest from the prior. This increases the versatility of the model.

5. The proposed model, Capacitron, demonstrates these contributions empirically, showing the ability to target different embedding capacities and enabling both high-fidelity and variable transfer as well as high-quality prior sampling using the same model architecture.

In summary, the key innovation is using embedding capacity as a unified framework for analyzing and configuring latent variable speech models, and showing how modifying the variational posterior can improve multi-purpose usage and transfer robustness. The proposed hierarchical capacity decomposition also increases model flexibility.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using embedding capacity (representational mutual information between embeddings and data) as a unified framework for analyzing and configuring latent variable models for speech synthesis, and shows that modifying the variational posterior to match the true posterior enables high quality style/prosody transfer and prior sampling in a single model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related work in end-to-end speech synthesis:

- The paper proposes analyzing latent variable models for speech synthesis in terms of their "embedding capacity" - the amount of information the latent embedding captures about the data. This provides a unifying framework for understanding and comparing different model architectures.

- It builds on previous heuristic/non-variational approaches like Global Style Tokens (Wang et al. 2018) and prosody transfer (Skerry-Ryan et al. 2018) by using a variational autoencoder framework. This allows more explicit control over embedding capacity.

- Compared to previous variational TTS models like Hsu et al. (2018) and Zhang et al. (2019), this work shows the importance of conditioning the variational posterior on text and speaker inputs to match the true posterior. This leads to better performance.

- The proposed Capacitron model demonstrates how the same architecture can achieve high-fidelity prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and high-quality prior sampling by controlling embedding capacity. This is more flexible than previous models targeting only one of these applications.

- For style transfer, the hierarchical decomposition of latents in Capacitron provides a way to control the tradeoff between transfer fidelity and sample variation, which is novel compared to earlier hierarchical TTS models.

- The inter-speaker transfer results show Capacitron can preserve speaker identity better than heuristic transfer models, likely due to the information limiting properties of variational methods.

So in summary, this paper brings together variational methods with conditioning strategies to develop a very flexible end-to-end TTS model that unifies and advances several threads of prior work through the lens of embedding capacity. The analyses and techniques introduced provide a strong foundation for future research in controllable speech synthesis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more powerful posterior distributions beyond simple diagonal Gaussians, such as mixtures of Gaussians or normalizing flows. This could improve the quality of samples drawn from the prior.

- Using variable-length embeddings that are synchronous with either the text or audio, rather than fixed-length embeddings. This could better capture temporal structure. 

- Replacing the deterministic decoder with a proper likelihood model to enable fully generative sampling. The current greedy decoding process limits diversity.

- Developing methods to distribute speech characteristics (e.g. style, emotion, speaker traits) in a structured way across subsets of the hierarchical latent variables. This could enable more fine-grained control over different aspects of the generated speech. 

- Extending the hierarchical decomposition beyond two levels of latents, which could provide even more flexibility for transfer tasks and sampling.

- Adapting the fixed prior distribution to be learned and conditioned on text/speaker as well, which could improve sample quality when generating speech from scratch rather than transferring styles.

- Exploring the use of these latent variable models for purposes beyond style/prosody transfer, such as disentangled representation learning and semi-supervised training.

In summary, the main suggested directions are improving the flexibility and quality of the latent distributions, adding more temporal structure, replacing greedy decoding, enabling more fine-grained control, and exploring more applications of the latent variable framework.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using embedding capacity, defined as the representational mutual information between the embedding and data, as a unified way to analyze and configure latent variable models for text-to-speech synthesis. The authors introduce a model called Capacitron that adds conditional dependencies to the variational posterior to match the form of the true posterior. This allows the model to achieve high-precision prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and generation of natural sounding prior samples all within the same framework. The model also decomposes embedding capacity hierarchically across two sets of latents, enabling control over the tradeoff between transfer fidelity and sample variation. Experiments demonstrate Capacitron's improved performance on prosody and style transfer tasks compared to heuristic transfer methods, as well as its ability to generate diverse but realistic samples by drawing from the learned prior. Key innovations include the use of embedding capacity for model analysis, modifying the variational posterior to match the true posterior, and hierarchical decomposition of capacity across latent subsets.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing and configuring latent variable models for expressive speech synthesis. It introduces the concept of embedding capacity, which refers to the amount of information the latent embedding contains about the data. Embedding capacity is bounded above by the KL divergence term in the variational lower bound. The authors show that capacity is correlated with perceptual similarity to a reference signal during prosody transfer. They propose a model called Capacitron which adds conditional dependencies to the variational posterior so it better matches the true posterior. This allows the model to achieve high-fidelity prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and natural-sounding prior samples within the same framework. The model also introduces a hierarchical decomposition of embedding capacity, with one set of latents controlling fidelity to a reference and another set controlling variability when sampling. Experiments demonstrate Capacitron's ability to balance precision and generality in transfer tasks and sample naturally from the prior. The framework provides a unified way to analyze trade-offs in latent variable models for speech synthesis.

In summary, the key ideas are:
- Introducing embedding capacity as a unified framework for analyzing speech synthesis models
- Showing capacity correlates with perceptual similarity
- Proposing Capacitron which matches the variational posterior to the true posterior
- Achieving high-fidelity transfer and natural prior samples
- Decomposing capacity hierarchically for precision/variability trade-off
- Demonstrating precise transfer, flexible sampling, and natural synthesis


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a variational autoencoder framework for expressive end-to-end speech synthesis that allows explicit control over the information capacity of learned embeddings. The key contributions are modifying the variational posterior to match the form of the true posterior by conditioning it on text and speaker information, and decomposing the embedding capacity hierarchically across two sets of latent variables. This allows the model to target specific embedding capacities using a Lagrange multiplier optimization scheme, enabling high-precision prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and generation of natural-sounding prior samples all within the same model. The hierarchical decomposition also provides a way to control the tradeoff between transfer fidelity and sample variation when transferring style characteristics between utterances. Overall, the unified framework based on embedding capacity provides new capabilities and versatility compared to previous heuristic and variational approaches.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 According to the abstract, the paper is addressing the problem of building expressive end-to-end speech synthesis systems that can control and transfer prosody and style while generating natural sounding speech. The key questions they are trying to address include:

- How can we analyze and compare different latent variable models for speech synthesis in a unified way? They propose using the concept of "embedding capacity" or representational mutual information.

- How can we configure these models to achieve the right tradeoffs between precision, generality, and naturalness? They show that matching the form of the variational posterior to the true posterior enables using the same model for high-fidelity prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and natural sounding prior samples.

- How can we control what fraction of variation in the output is specified vs randomly sampled? They introduce a method to hierarchically decompose embedding capacity across multiple sets of latent variables.

So in summary, the key focus is on developing expressive end-to-end models with more control over prosody and style transfer while still generating high quality and natural sounding speech. The paper tackles this by proposing techniques to analyze, configure, and decompose the information capacity of latent variable models.
