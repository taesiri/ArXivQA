# [Dynamic 3D Gaussians: Tracking by Persistent Dynamic View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09713)

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the idea of using Dynamic 3D Gaussians to model dynamic scenes. How do the properties of Gaussians (e.g. being soft and having infinite support) help with modeling dynamic scenes compared to alternative representations like points?

2. The paper enforces physical plausibility of the Dynamic 3D Gaussian reconstruction using local rigidity, local rotational similarity, and long-term local isometry losses. Can you explain the intuition behind each of these losses and how they help regularize the optimization? 

3. Tracking emerges naturally from the persistent Dynamic 3D Gaussian representation without requiring any correspondence supervision. Why does enforcing persistence of the Gaussians' attributes enable accurate tracking to emerge?

4. The ablation study shows that the local rigidity loss is crucial for good tracking performance. Why might directly enforcing rigidity between neighbouring Gaussians be more effective than relying on the rendering loss alone to induce rigidity?

5. How does explicitly modeling rotation with the Dynamic 3D Gaussians allow for recovering full 6-DOF motion compared to a point-based representation? What applications does having the rotational motion enable?

6. The Dynamic 3D Gaussian representation lends itself well to editing applications like attaching novel views to keypoints or propagating edits across time. What properties of the representation make these applications straightforward?

7. What are the tradeoffs between this method's particle-based Lagrangian representation versus grid-based Eulerian representations for modeling dynamic scenes? How do they compare in terms of correspondence and novel view synthesis?

8. The method requires a multi-camera capture setup and does not work off-the-shelf on monocular video. How could you extend the approach to handle monocular video input? What challenges does monocular input present?

9. The paper mentions real-time rendering applications as an advantage of this method. How is the rendering process efficient compared to other neural rendering techniques? Why is real-time feasible?

10. What are some limitations of this method? For example, how could it be extended to handle dynamic scenes with objects entering and leaving the field of view?


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method for simultaneous dynamic 3D scene modeling, novel view synthesis, and 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) tracking using Dynamic 3D Gaussians. Specifically:

- They represent dynamic 3D scenes as collections of 3D Gaussians whose positions and orientations change over time, but with consistent color, opacity and size.

- They introduce differentiable rendering of these Dynamic 3D Gaussians to optimize them to match input camera views across time, enabling dynamic novel view synthesis.

- They enforce physical priors like local rigidity during optimization so the Gaussians track the same physical points over time, resulting in persistent dense 6-DOF tracking as a byproduct of novel view synthesis. 

- They demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets for novel view synthesis and especially long-term dense tracking in both 2D and 3D.

- The decomposability of the Gaussians enables creative downstream applications like attaching cameras to scene elements, editing across time, and combining scenes.

In summary, the key contribution is using persistent Dynamic 3D Gaussians for unified dynamic scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and 6-DOF tracking in a differentiable rendering framework. The results and applications showcase the promise of this representation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method for simultaneously modeling and rendering dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view video while achieving persistent dense 6-DOF tracking, by representing scenes with particles called Dynamic 3D Gaussians that move and rotate over time with enforced physical consistency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other research in dynamic 3D scene modeling, novel view synthesis, and tracking:

- The use of 3D Gaussians to represent the scene is novel compared to prior work like NeRF which uses MLPs or grid-based approaches. Gaussians provide a natural decomposition of the scene into particles that can move independently. 

- Modeling full 6-DOF motion including rotation with 3D Gaussians is also new compared to point-based representations used in some prior work. This allows imposing physical priors on rotation as well as translation.

- Emergence of tracking from view synthesis optimization alone, without any flow or correspondence supervision, sets it apart from methods that require ground truth tracks or optical flow as input.

- Real-time optimization and rendering during test time is much faster than many learning-based approaches that require offline training. Enables applications requiring real-time performance.

- Multi-view input used here provides more accurate metric reconstruction compared to monocular methods. But monocular capability could be a promising extension.

- Lack of any training data beyond the test frames makes it more general than approaches that require large labeled tracking datasets. However, it can currently only track visible points unlike learning methods.

- Creative editing applications like attaching cameras to scene points are enabled by the decomposable Gaussian representation. Unseen in most prior dynamic reconstruction work.

Overall, the combination of accuracy, speed, generalizability and creative applications make this paper unique compared to prior work on similar tasks. The Gaussian representation and emergence of tracking from optimization seem to be the biggest innovations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions to build upon and extend their Dynamic 3D Gaussian representation:

1. Tracking new objects entering the scene. The current method is limited to only tracking parts of the scene visible in the initial frame. Extending it to handle new objects entering would be an interesting direction.

2. Working from monocular video input instead of requiring multi-camera setups. Adapting the method to work from single-view video could greatly expand its applicability. 

3. Exploring real-time applications. The efficiency and speed of their method makes it amenable for real-time rendering and AR/VR applications. This could be an exciting area to explore further.

4. Creative editing of dynamic scenes. Their decomposable Gaussian representation lends itself well to editing applications like propagating edits, attaching objects to scene elements, etc. More work could be done to develop these creative possibilities.

5. Combining generative neural rendering with their analysis-by-synthesis optimization framework. For example, using a neural renderer like NeRF to initialize the scene instead of using traditional computer vision techniques.

In summary, the main suggested directions are extending the capability to handle new objects and monocular video, leveraging the speed for real-time applications, developing the creative editing potential, and combining with more powerful generative neural rendering techniques. The limitations of the current method point to exciting avenues for future innovation in dynamic 3D modeling, tracking and rendering.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we simultaneously perform dynamic 3D scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) tracking of all scene elements in a unified framework?

The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question are:

- Proposing a representation for dynamic scenes using "Dynamic 3D Gaussians" where Gaussians persist over time with fixed attributes like color, opacity, size etc. but can move and rotate. 

- Modeling scenes by optimizing these Dynamic 3D Gaussians using differentiable rendering and image reconstruction losses. This enables reconstructing a metric dynamic 3D scene.

- Introducing physically-inspired regularization losses like local rigidity and local isometry that ensure the Dynamic 3D Gaussians move in a physically plausible way over time.

- Showing that accurate dense 6-DOF tracking emerges naturally from the persistent dynamic modeling process, without needing any correspondence supervision. 

- Demonstrating high quality novel view synthesis, state-of-the-art long-term 2D and 3D tracking performance, and downstream applications like dynamic editing and first-person rendering.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that persistent dynamic modeling of scenes using regularized Dynamic 3D Gaussians can simultaneously enable high quality dynamic view synthesis and accurate dense tracking in a unified framework. The results validate this hypothesis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for simultaneous dynamic 3D scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and dense 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) tracking using a representation called Dynamic 3D Gaussians. The key idea is to model dynamic scenes as a collection of colored 3D Gaussians with fixed color, opacity, and size but movable centers and orientations over time. By enforcing persistence, local rigidity, and local rotational similarity of the Gaussians through differentiable rendering and gradient-based optimization, the method is able to reconstruct dynamic scenes and track all elements in 6-DOF without any correspondence supervision. Experiments on multi-view video datasets demonstrate high quality novel view synthesis and state-of-the-art tracking accuracy. The decomposable Gaussian representation also enables creative downstream applications like propagating edits across time, attaching cameras to scene elements for first-person view synthesis, and inserting scanned objects that follow the scene motion.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a method for dynamic 3D scene modeling, novel view synthesis, and dense 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) tracking using a representation called Dynamic 3D Gaussians. The key idea is to model a dynamic 3D scene as a collection of 3D Gaussians whose positions and orientations change over time, but whose color, opacity, and size stay fixed. This allows the Gaussians to persistently represent the same aspects of the physical scene over time as they move and rotate. The motion and rotation of the Gaussians is optimized using differentiable rendering and regularization losses that enforce local rigidity of motion and rotation between Gaussians. This optimization process, along with the persistent nature of the Gaussian representation, gives rise to accurate dense correspondence between all scene points across all timesteps and views without requiring any correspondence supervision. 

The method is evaluated on multi-view video datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis and long-term dense 2D and 3D tracking. The persistent dynamic representation also enables intuitive editing of dynamic scenes, such as attaching virtual cameras to scene points, propagating image edits across time, and combining or modifying dynamic scene elements. The main limitations are the requirement for a multi-camera input and inability to handle new objects entering the scene. Overall, this work demonstrates promising results for reconstructing and synthesizing high-quality persistent dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view video for applications in VR/AR and computer graphics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for dynamic 3D scene modeling, view synthesis, and 6-DOF tracking using Dynamic 3D Gaussians. The key ideas are:

- Represent the dynamic scene as a collection of 3D Gaussians with persistent color, opacity, and size over time but variable position and orientation. 

- Render the Gaussians differentiably into camera views via splatting to optimize their parameters.

- Enforce physical priors like local rigidity and isometry during optimization so Gaussians track the same physical points over time.

- Track points by finding the highest influence Gaussian and following it in its local coordinate system. 

- Demonstrate high quality novel view synthesis and state-of-the-art long-term 2D and 3D tracking on complex real scenes, without any correspondence supervision.

In summary, the paper models dynamic scenes using particles with persistence priors that move rigidly. By rendering these particles in a differentiable manner, the model can be optimized to reconstruct the scene and enable tracking of all points as a byproduct.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper addresses the problem of simultaneously reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view video data and performing dense long-term tracking of all elements in the scene. Specifically, it tackles the tasks of:

1) Dynamic novel view synthesis - Rendering novel unseen views of a dynamic 3D scene at any timestep.

2) Long-term dense point tracking - Tracking the 3D location and rotation of every point in the scene over long time horizons (150 timesteps in their experiments).

3) Dynamic reconstruction - Reconstructing a metric 3D representation of the full dynamic scene that is consistent with input images across time and viewpoints. 

The key questions the paper tries to address are:

- How can we represent dynamic 3D scenes in a way that enables accurate novel view synthesis while also naturally giving rise to long-term dense correspondences for tracking?

- How can we enforce physical plausibility in the motion and deformation of the 3D scene representation over time?

- How can we reconstruct complex non-rigid motions over long time periods without requiring any ground truth correspondence or flow data during training/optimization?

The main insight of the paper is representing scenes with particles (3D Gaussians) that have persistent properties across time steps but can freely move and rotate. By enforcing various physical priors on their motion, long-term tracking and reconstruction emerges from the process of novel view synthesis through time.
