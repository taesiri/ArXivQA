# [Perception-Oriented Single Image Super-Resolution using Optimal   Objective Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13676)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high quality super-resolution (SR) results that have both high perceptual quality and low distortion. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new SR framework to find and apply optimal combinations of perceptual and distortion losses for each region of the image, in order to optimize the trade-off between perceptual quality and distortion reduction.

The key ideas and contributions are:

- A new SR framework with two models: a predictive model that estimates the optimal loss combination (objective) for each region, and a generative model that produces the SR image reflecting the predicted regional objectives.

- Introduction of "objective trajectory learning" to efficiently train a single generative model that can flexibly optimize different combinations of losses based on the predicted objective map. 

- A method to obtain supervised training data of optimal regional objectives by grid search over the objective trajectory.

- Experimental results showing the proposed method achieves improved perceptual quality and reduced distortion compared to state-of-the-art perception-driven SR methods.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that predicting and applying optimal regional combinations of perceptual and distortion losses can achieve better overall perceptual quality and lower distortion in SR. The proposed models and training methods aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new single image super-resolution (SISR) framework that applies optimal objectives for each region to generate perceptually accurate high-resolution (HR) outputs. The key points are:

- The framework consists of two models - a predictive model that infers the optimal objective map for a given low-resolution (LR) input, and a generative model that applies the objective map to produce the corresponding SR output.

- The generative model is trained over an "objective trajectory" representing a set of essential objectives. This enables a single network to learn various SR results corresponding to combined losses on the trajectory. 

- The predictive model is trained using pairs of LR images and corresponding optimal objective maps obtained by searching the objective trajectory.

- Experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in perception-oriented SR, reducing both distortion and artifacts while enhancing perceptual quality.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel SISR framework to generate perceptually accurate super-resolution outputs by estimating and applying optimal region-specific objectives for a given LR input image. The key novelty is the objective trajectory learning and optimal objective map estimation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new single image super-resolution framework with a predictive model that infers optimal objectives for image regions and a generative model that applies these objectives to produce perceptually accurate high-resolution outputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for single image super-resolution (SISR) that focuses on improving perceptual quality. Here are some key aspects in relation to other SISR research:

- Most prior work has focused on either distortion-oriented losses (e.g. MSE, L1) for maximizing PSNR, or perception-oriented losses (e.g. adversarial, perceptual) for realism. This paper proposes a method to optimize a combination of both within a single framework.

- Rather than using a global objective, they estimate an optimal objective map tailored to each image region. This allows applying region-specific losses to maximize quality. Most methods apply a uniform objective. 

- They introduce an efficient training approach called "objective trajectory learning" to enable a single generator model to produce varying results based on the objective map, rather than training separate models per objective.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both perceptual metrics like LPIPS and distortion metrics like PSNR, suggesting their method achieves excellent realism while minimizing distortions.

- Most conditional SISR methods rely on external guidance like segmentation maps or reference images. A key contribution here is predicting the optimal objective map directly from the LR input in a fully unsupervised manner.

In summary, this paper presents a novel perceptual SISR approach that adaptively determines region-specific objectives to optimize visual quality in a principled way. The results demonstrate improved performance over existing methods by effectively balancing perceptual quality and fidelity. The idea of objective trajectory learning could be useful for other conditional image synthesis tasks as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions:

- Improving the generator model to be able to produce more accurate high-resolution outputs given the optimal objective maps. They point out there are still limitations in reconstructing high-frequency details lost in the low-resolution images even with optimized objectives. They suggest exploring more sophisticated perceptual losses beyond VGG features.

- Improving the predictive model to estimate more accurate optimal objective maps. The authors note there is still room for improvement compared to the upper bound performance of using exhaustive search to find optimal maps. Better network architectures could be explored.

- Extending the framework to other image restoration tasks beyond super-resolution, such as denoising, deblurring etc. The idea of estimating spatially-varying optimal objectives could be beneficial for these tasks as well.

- Exploring different choices of objectives - the losses and feature spaces used to compute perceptual losses. The authors used a limited set in this work, but there may be better objectives to capture perceptual quality.

- Reducing the complexity of the approach to make it more practical. The current framework has high complexity with two networks. Simplifications could be explored.

Overall the core ideas could be extended and improved in several ways, including the models, objectives, tasks, and efficiency of the framework. The authors provide good suggestions for future work to build on their approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new single image super-resolution (SISR) framework that applies optimal objectives for each region to generate plausible high-resolution (HR) results overall. The framework has two models - a predictive model that infers an optimal objective map for a given low-resolution (LR) input, and a generative model that applies the objective map to produce the corresponding SR output. The generative model is trained on a proposed objective trajectory representing essential objectives, enabling a single network to learn various SR outputs for combined losses. The predictive model is trained on LR-HR pairs and corresponding optimal objective maps obtained by searching the trajectory. Experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art perception-driven SR methods in perceptual metrics like LPIPS and DISTS, and distortion metrics like PSNR and SSIM. The key ideas are using a trajectory for efficient multi-objective training, and inferring optimal regional combinations of objectives for accurate and consistent SR reconstruction.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework for single image super-resolution (SISR) that aims to generate perceptually accurate high-resolution (HR) images. The framework consists of two models - a predictive model that estimates an optimal objective map for a given low-resolution (LR) input, and a generative model that applies the objective map to produce a corresponding super-resolved (SR) output. 

The key idea is to apply locally optimal combinations of perceptual and distortion losses to different regions of the image, instead of using a single fixed loss function. The generative model is trained on a continuous trajectory of weighted multi-loss objectives from distortion to perceptual dominance. This allows a single model to generate varying SR outputs based on the input objective map. The predictive model is trained to estimate near optimal objective maps using supervised data obtained by sweeping parameter search. Experiments demonstrate improved perceptual quality and reduced distortion compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving high visual realism while maintaining accuracy. The framework provides a way to overcome the distortion-perception tradeoff in SISR by adaptive objective estimation and application.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to generate high-quality super-resolution (SR) images that have both high perceptual quality and low distortion. Some key points:

- Existing SR methods based on perceptual losses (e.g. SRGAN) can generate realistic textures but tend to distort structures. Methods based on distortion losses (e.g. MSE) give sharper results but lack details. There is a trade-off between perceptual quality and distortion. 

- The paper proposes a new framework to achieve the best of both worlds - high perceptual quality and low distortion. 

- The key ideas are: 

1) Estimating an "optimal objective map" for each input image, specifying the ideal trade-off between perceptual and distortion losses in each image region. This allows optimizing different regions differently.

2) Training a single SR generator that can flexibly optimize for different weighted combinations of losses based on the objective map. This is done by training over a continuous "objective trajectory" spanning the loss trade-offs.

- Experiments show the proposed method (SROOE) outperforms state-of-the-art perception-driven SR and also distortion-driven SR in both perceptual metrics (LPIPS) and distortion metrics (PSNR).

In summary, the paper presents a framework to super-resolve images by adaptively selecting optimal trade-offs between perceptual and distortion losses in different regions, achieving new state-of-the-art results. The core ideas are estimating objective maps and training over an objective trajectory.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and keywords for this paper include:

- Single image super-resolution (SISR) 
- Perception-oriented reconstruction
- Optimal objective estimation (OOE)
- Locally optimal objectives
- Objective trajectory 
- Perceptual loss
- Generative adversarial loss
- Condition branch
- Spatial feature transform (SFT) layers

The main focus of the paper seems to be on proposing a new SISR framework that can estimate and apply optimal combinations of objectives (losses) for each region of the input image. This is done through two models - a predictive model that estimates the optimal objective map, and a generative model that applies these objectives to super-resolve the image. 

The key ideas include using an "objective trajectory" to train the generative model on different combinations of losses, and using spatial feature transform layers to allow the model to adapt based on the estimated objective map. Experiments show improved results compared to prior perception-oriented SISR methods in terms of perceptual quality and distortion metrics.

In summary, the key terms revolve around optimizing objectives/losses for SISR in a spatially-adaptive way to improve perceptual reconstruction quality. The proposed framework with the objective estimator and trajectory training enables this.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework for single image super-resolution (SISR) that can produce high-quality results with reduced visual artifacts and improved perceptual quality. The key idea is to estimate an optimal combination of objectives for each local region of the input image, and generate a super-resolved output that reflects those objectives. The framework consists of two models - a predictive model that takes a low-resolution input and predicts a map of optimal objectives, and a generative model that applies those objectives to produce the final output. To enable a single generative model to handle varying objectives, the authors propose training it on an "objective trajectory" that transitions from lower-level to higher-level vision objectives. The predictive model is trained to estimate objective maps that maximize perceptual quality, using example maps obtained by searching over the trajectory. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with the proposed SROOE method achieving improved perceptual metrics like LPIPS while also having high PSNR, outperforming other recent perception-oriented SISR methods. The ability to estimate and apply optimal local objectives provides a way to reduce common artifacts and distortions in perception-driven super-resolution.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new single image super-resolution (SISR) framework that estimates and applies an optimal combination of objectives for each input region to produce perceptually accurate and high-quality super-resolved images. The framework consists of two models - a predictive model that infers the most appropriate objectives for a given LR image, and a generative model that applies locally varying objectives from a continuous objective trajectory to generate the corresponding SR result. The trajectory is formed by connecting selected objectives suitable for different vision levels and trained efficiently using a vector function of objectives parameterized by a 1D variable.
