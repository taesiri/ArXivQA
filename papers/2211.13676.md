# [Perception-Oriented Single Image Super-Resolution using Optimal   Objective Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13676)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high quality super-resolution (SR) results that have both high perceptual quality and low distortion. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new SR framework to find and apply optimal combinations of perceptual and distortion losses for each region of the image, in order to optimize the trade-off between perceptual quality and distortion reduction.

The key ideas and contributions are:

- A new SR framework with two models: a predictive model that estimates the optimal loss combination (objective) for each region, and a generative model that produces the SR image reflecting the predicted regional objectives.

- Introduction of "objective trajectory learning" to efficiently train a single generative model that can flexibly optimize different combinations of losses based on the predicted objective map. 

- A method to obtain supervised training data of optimal regional objectives by grid search over the objective trajectory.

- Experimental results showing the proposed method achieves improved perceptual quality and reduced distortion compared to state-of-the-art perception-driven SR methods.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that predicting and applying optimal regional combinations of perceptual and distortion losses can achieve better overall perceptual quality and lower distortion in SR. The proposed models and training methods aim to test this hypothesis.
