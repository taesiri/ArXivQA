# [Perception-Oriented Single Image Super-Resolution using Optimal   Objective Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13676)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high quality super-resolution (SR) results that have both high perceptual quality and low distortion. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new SR framework to find and apply optimal combinations of perceptual and distortion losses for each region of the image, in order to optimize the trade-off between perceptual quality and distortion reduction.

The key ideas and contributions are:

- A new SR framework with two models: a predictive model that estimates the optimal loss combination (objective) for each region, and a generative model that produces the SR image reflecting the predicted regional objectives.

- Introduction of "objective trajectory learning" to efficiently train a single generative model that can flexibly optimize different combinations of losses based on the predicted objective map. 

- A method to obtain supervised training data of optimal regional objectives by grid search over the objective trajectory.

- Experimental results showing the proposed method achieves improved perceptual quality and reduced distortion compared to state-of-the-art perception-driven SR methods.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that predicting and applying optimal regional combinations of perceptual and distortion losses can achieve better overall perceptual quality and lower distortion in SR. The proposed models and training methods aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new single image super-resolution (SISR) framework that applies optimal objectives for each region to generate perceptually accurate high-resolution (HR) outputs. The key points are:

- The framework consists of two models - a predictive model that infers the optimal objective map for a given low-resolution (LR) input, and a generative model that applies the objective map to produce the corresponding SR output.

- The generative model is trained over an "objective trajectory" representing a set of essential objectives. This enables a single network to learn various SR results corresponding to combined losses on the trajectory. 

- The predictive model is trained using pairs of LR images and corresponding optimal objective maps obtained by searching the objective trajectory.

- Experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in perception-oriented SR, reducing both distortion and artifacts while enhancing perceptual quality.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel SISR framework to generate perceptually accurate super-resolution outputs by estimating and applying optimal region-specific objectives for a given LR input image. The key novelty is the objective trajectory learning and optimal objective map estimation.

The paper proposes a new single image super-resolution framework with a predictive model that infers optimal objectives for image regions and a generative model that applies these objectives to produce perceptually accurate high-resolution outputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for single image super-resolution (SISR) that focuses on improving perceptual quality. Here are some key aspects in relation to other SISR research:

- Most prior work has focused on either distortion-oriented losses (e.g. MSE, L1) for maximizing PSNR, or perception-oriented losses (e.g. adversarial, perceptual) for realism. This paper proposes a method to optimize a combination of both within a single framework.

- Rather than using a global objective, they estimate an optimal objective map tailored to each image region. This allows applying region-specific losses to maximize quality. Most methods apply a uniform objective. 

- They introduce an efficient training approach called "objective trajectory learning" to enable a single generator model to produce varying results based on the objective map, rather than training separate models per objective.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both perceptual metrics like LPIPS and distortion metrics like PSNR, suggesting their method achieves excellent realism while minimizing distortions.

- Most conditional SISR methods rely on external guidance like segmentation maps or reference images. A key contribution here is predicting the optimal objective map directly from the LR input in a fully unsupervised manner.

In summary, this paper presents a novel perceptual SISR approach that adaptively determines region-specific objectives to optimize visual quality in a principled way. The results demonstrate improved performance over existing methods by effectively balancing perceptual quality and fidelity. The idea of objective trajectory learning could be useful for other conditional image synthesis tasks as well.
