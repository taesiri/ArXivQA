# [ML4CO: Is GCNN All You Need? Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Produce   Strong Baselines For Combinatorial Optimization Problems, If Tuned and   Trained Properly, on Appropriate Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12251)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be whether graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) can produce strong baselines for combinatorial optimization problems when properly tuned and trained on appropriate data. 

The paper argues that with proper tuning and training on suitable datasets, even a simple GCNN architecture can achieve state-of-the-art performance on branching (variable selection) for mixed-integer linear programs, compared to conventional combinatorial optimization heuristics and solvers. This suggests that machine learning, and GCNNs in particular, are a viable option for enhancing traditional combinatorial optimization algorithms when historical data is available.

The main hypothesis appears to be that GCNNs are effective for these problems, if optimized appropriately. The paper provides empirical evidence for this through extensive experiments on datasets from the NeurIPS 2021 ML4CO competition. It highlights the importance of tuning training data collection, model architecture, and other hyperparameters in order to get the full potential out of GCNNs.

In summary, the central research question is about the viability of using GCNNS to improve combinatorial optimization solvers, and the main hypothesis is that they can produce strong baselines if tuned properly for the problem. The paper provides evidence for this hypothesis through strong experimental results on benchmark datasets.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper summarizes the solution and lessons learned by the Huawei team in the dual task of the 2021 NeurIPS ML4CO competition, where they achieved 2nd place by showing that a properly tuned and trained Graph Convolutional Neural Network can produce strong baselines for combinatorial optimization problems, if provided with suitable training data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of using machine learning to improve combinatorial optimization:

- This paper focuses specifically on the NeurIPS 2021 ML4CO competition and the task of variable selection in branch-and-bound search. Much of the other recent research has also focused on using machine learning for variable selection in B&B, so this work fits into that broader research area. 

- The paper advocates for using simple graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) for the variable selection task. Some other recent works have proposed more complex model architectures like reinforcement learning, incorporating the entire B&B tree, or using hybrid machine learning/optimization approaches. However, this paper argues that properly tuned GCNNs can achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task.

- The paper emphasizes the importance of generating suitable training data and provides analysis over many experiments on how factors like time limit, strong branching usage, and training set size impact performance. Other papers often do not investigate training data generation in such depth.

- The GCNN approach used is based on prior work by Nair et al. (2020), but this paper shows that even subsequent newer methods have not surpassed a well-tuned GCNN, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- The paper provides very thorough experimental results on the competition datasets, including ablation studies. Many papers rely on standard MILP benchmark datasets where details of training data generation are unclear. This paper advocates for use of competition datasets for better comparison.

- Overall, this paper provides a deep analysis into training and applying GCNNs for variable selection in B&B search, clearly demonstrating their capabilities compared to other methods with extensive experiments. The insights on training data generation and model tuning are highly valuable for research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Testing data augmentation techniques for the training data. The authors mention they did not have time to try data augmentation, but suggest it could be beneficial to artificially expand the training data in a way that preserves the linear equation structure. 

- Employing multiple models specialized for different problem clusters or types. The authors found the anonymous dataset contained 3 clusters of problems based on their structure. They suggest training separate models for each cluster could improve performance.

- Further exploring the balance between model accuracy and inference speed. The authors show there is a tradeoff between model performance and speed that affects the overall solving time. More research could optimize this balance. 

- Standardizing training and evaluation methodology when comparing ML for CO methods. The authors argue performance depends heavily on the training data generation process. They suggest using standardized datasets like the ML4CO benchmarks.

- Continued focus on data engineering in addition to new ML models/algorithms. The experiments show data aspects like sample collection settings have a huge impact on performance.

- Testing other neural network architectures beyond GCNNs. While GCNNs did very well, exploring other types of networks may lead to further gains.

In summary, the main suggestions are around better leveraging data aspects like augmentation and engineering, testing model ensembles, standardizing comparisons, and exploring neural network architectures - in addition to developing new algorithms. The key point is a joint focus on both data and models.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper summarizes the solution and lessons learned by the Huawei EI-OROAS team in the dual task of the 2021 NeurIPS ML4CO competition. The goal of the competition was to improve combinatorial optimization solvers by replacing key heuristic components with machine learning models, using historical data. The dual task focused on selecting branching variables to minimize the dual integral over time. The EI-OROAS team took second place, using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) approach. 

The authors argue that with proper tuning and training on appropriate data, a simple GCNN can achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task. They provide insights from many experiments and make several key remarks, including: 1) Top-1 classification accuracy does not guarantee the best reward, 2) GCNN results remain strong compared to newer methods, 3) Unique solutions did not work equally well across datasets, suggesting data-dependent approaches are important, 4) Finding the right balance between neural network accuracy and speed is critical. They conclude that data engineering plays an important role in addition to model improvements for combinatorial optimization learning approaches.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) approach to learn a policy for variable selection in branch-and-bound solvers for mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). The key ideas are:

- Model the branching decisions in a branch-and-bound tree as a Markov decision process (MDP). At each node, the solver state is represented as a bipartite graph between constraints and variables, with node and edge features capturing properties of the linear programming relaxation. 

- Learn a policy for variable selection using a GCNN architecture with interleaved convolutions between the constraint and variable nodes. The GCNN takes the bipartite state graph as input and outputs a softmax probability over branching candidates.

- Train the GCNN policy via imitation learning, using strong branching decisions from an expert solver as supervised labels. The goal is to learn a fast approximation of the expert strong branching policy.

- Evaluate the learned policy by running it online in place of default branching heuristics on unseen MILP test instances. The metric is the integral over the lower bound curve, which measures how quickly the policy can prove optimality.

In summary, the key contribution is using GCNNs applied directly on the bipartite MILP graph structure to imitate strong branching, replacing hand-engineered variable selection heuristics with a learned policy.
