# [Diffusion with Forward Models: Solving Stochastic Inverse Problems   Without Direct Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11719)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we develop a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model that can learn to sample from the distribution of signals that are never observed directly, but instead are only measured through a known differentiable forward model?The key idea is to integrate the known differentiable forward model directly into the denoising diffusion process, which allows the model to train on observations while still modeling the distribution of the unobserved signals that generated those observations. The paper aims to show that this approach can enable conditional sampling from distributions over complex unobserved signals like 3D scenes, given only partial observations like 2D images. The central hypothesis seems to be that incorporating the forward model in this way will allow the diffusion model to accurately capture these highly complex conditional distributions, even without ever seeing examples of the full 3D scenes during training.In summary, the paper tackles the problem of training generative models to sample from distributions over unobserved signals, by integrating forward models with diffusion models in an end-to-end fashion. The key hypothesis is that this approach will succeed at modeling distributions in challenging inverse problems where signals are never observed directly.
