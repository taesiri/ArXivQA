## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies permutation invariant functions, which are functions whose output does not change if the input variables are permuted. These functions play an important role in machine learning applications like set anomaly detection and point cloud classification. The paper examines several fundamental problems related to permutation invariant functions: (1) testing if a multivariate distribution is permutation invariant (2) estimating a permutation invariant density (3) analyzing the complexity and generalization ability of permutation invariant function classes using metric entropy (4) nonparametric regression of permutation invariant functions.   

Proposed Solutions and Contributions:

1) The paper proposes a statistical test to check if a multivariate distribution is permutation invariant. The test statistic measures the maximum difference between the empirical CDF and the "sorted" empirical CDF over all points. The critical value is computed using a multiplier bootstrap procedure. Theoretical guarantees are provided on the validity of the test even as the dimension grows with sample size.

2) For density estimation, the paper proposes an averaged kernel density estimator that averages over permutations of the point where density is evaluated. This estimator has the same bias but lower variance compared to the standard KDE. Explicit variance reduction bounds are derived.

3) Fundamentally, the paper shows that imposing permutation invariance reduces the metric entropy (complexity measure) of common function classes like HÃ¶lder and ellipsoid by a factor of 1/d!. This indicates improved generalization ability.

4) For nonparametric regression, the paper proposes a simple "sorting trick" where the features are sorted before applying standard estimators like kernel ridge regression. This automatically respects permutation invariance without needing to derive specialized techniques.

The key methodological innovations are (i) a novel statistical test using sorting (ii) an averaged estimator trick (iii) sorting trick for exploitation of permutation invariance in nonparametric regression. The fundamental results connecting permutation invariance to reductions in metric entropy offer new theoretical insights. Overall, the paper develops new statistical tools tailored to permutation invariant functions while also elucidating some of their fundamental statistical properties.
