# [Token Fusion: Bridging the Gap between Token Pruning and Token Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01026)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViTs) offer flexibility for computer vision tasks but have high computational costs, limiting deployment on edge devices. 
- Prior work on efficient ViTs focuses on approximating the attention mechanism, but does not address the overall number of tokens.
- Recently, token pruning and token merging have emerged as ways to reduce tokens. However, pruning risks losing information and merging relies on functional linearity of model layers.

Proposed Solution - Token Fusion (ToFu):
- Combines the strengths of pruning and merging based on the functional linearity of each layer.  
- Uses pruning in early layers with low functional linearity to avoid issues from input interpolation.
- Transitions to a new merging approach called MLERP in later more linear layers. MLERP preserves feature norms compared to average merging.
- Overall, ToFu dynamically selects pruning or merging per layer to optimize accuracy and efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of ToFu, which adapts pruning versus merging based on functional linearity of each layer
- Presentation of MLERP merging to address limitations of average merging by preserving feature norms
- Empirical validation showing ToFu outperforms standalone pruning and merging for ImageNet classification and Stable Diffusion image generation
- Demonstration of accuracy and speed advantages from ToFu across various vision transformer sizes

In summary, this paper makes key contributions in efficiently reducing tokens in ViTs by judiciously combining pruning and an enhanced merging approach based on properties of each layer. Experiments underscore ToFu's capabilities for deploying ViTs effectively on edge devices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

Token Fusion introduces a novel technique to efficiently reduce tokens in Vision Transformers by dynamically combining token pruning and merging methods based on each layer's functional linearity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of "Token Fusion" (ToFu), a method that dynamically combines token pruning and token merging techniques in Vision Transformers. Specifically:

1) ToFu adapts to each layer's functional linearity properties, using pruning in early layers where nonlinearity is higher and merging in later more linear layers. This hybrid approach delivers superior accuracy over just pruning or merging alone.

2) The paper presents "MLERP merging", an enhancement over traditional average merging that preserves feature norms. This addresses distribution shift issues faced in average merging. 

3) Empirical evaluations on ImageNet classification and Stable Diffusion image generation demonstrate ToFu's accuracy and efficiency advantages over state-of-the-art token reduction techniques.

In summary, Token Fusion unifies the strengths of pruning and merging in a single algorithm that outperforms either approach individually. The method is tailored to harness the unique characteristics of different layers in Vision Transformers.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Token Fusion (ToFu): The proposed method that dynamically combines token pruning and token merging in vision transformers, adapting based on a layer's functional linearity.

- Token pruning: Removing or eliminating certain tokens from a vision transformer to improve efficiency. 

- Token merging: Consolidating similar tokens by averaging or otherwise combining them.

- Bipartite Soft Matching (BSM): The algorithm used to discern top similar token pairs for merging/pruning. 

- Functional linearity: The degree to which a neural network layer responds linearly when interpolating between inputs. Used to determine when to prune vs merge tokens.

- MLERP (Maximum Norm Linear Interpolation): Proposed enhancement over average merging that preserves feature norms.

- Hybrid merging: ToFu's strategy of using pruned merging in early layers and MLERP merging in later layers based on analysis of functional linearity.

- Efficiency vs. accuracy tradeoff: Key consideration in token reduction techniques, balancing speed and performance.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed ToFu method, its components like selective token pruning/merging, and concepts like functional linearity that guide adaptation in ToFu. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
