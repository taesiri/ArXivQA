# [Mapping High-level Semantic Regions in Indoor Environments without   Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07076)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the task of indoor semantic region mapping (ISRM) for embodied AI agents. ISRM involves recognizing high-level semantic regions (e.g. bedroom, kitchen, etc.) in indoor environments while simultaneously mapping them. This is challenging as semantic regions are not easily delineated by objects alone. Prior work has focused extensively on object detection and scene graphs, while less effort has examined purely mapping semantic regions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an end-to-end neural architecture to map semantic regions during embodied navigation without relying on object recognition. It consists of:

1) A region classification module based on a finetuned CLIP model to classify RGB observations into semantic regions. A multi-modal supervised contrastive loss is used to adapt CLIP to the region classification task.

2) A neural mapper module to generate egocentric occupancy and semantic region maps from RGB-D observations. It injects CLIP's semantic features into a UNet-based architecture. The maps are aggregated into a global map during exploration.  

3) A hierarchical navigation policy for exploration and mapping. A global policy sets long-term goals for coverage, while a local policy avoids obstacles.

The method is trained on a collected dataset of RGB-D observations and semantic maps from Matterport3D environments.

Main Contributions:

1) A region classification module finetuned on CLIP using multi-modal supervised contrastive loss to classify regions from RGB, without object recognition.

2) An end-to-end neural mapping architecture to incrementally fuse egocentric semantic observations into a global semantic map.

3) Extensive experiments showing the advantage of high-level semantic mapping over object-based mapping baselines in both offline and online settings. The method outperforms baselines by 14.2% in online accuracy.
