# [GMKF: Generalized Moment Kalman Filter for Polynomial Systems with   Arbitrary Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- State estimation in nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian noise is challenging. Common approaches like Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) use only the mean and covariance to approximate the belief. This is insufficient for non-Gaussian noise distributions.

- The paper considers polynomial dynamical systems (broad class including nonlinear dynamics and dynamics over Lie groups) with arbitrary noise distributions. Goal is to improve state estimation by incorporating higher order moments to better capture noise distributions.

Contributions:

1) Batch estimation setup (given all measurements up to current time):
- Formulate optimal state estimation as a Polynomial Optimization Problem (POP), while specifying a finite number of noise moments (beyond mean and covariance).
- Solve POP via semidefinite relaxation (moment + sum-of-squares (SOS)).
- Prove that under rank conditions, optimal estimate and an SOS belief representation (generalization of Gaussian) are obtained. This is called Best Polynomial Unbiased Estimator (BPUE).

2) Recursive filtering (GMKF):  
- Based on BPUE insights, propose Generalized Moment Kalman Filter (GMKF) for state estimation in polynomial systems with arbitrary noise.
- GMKF propagates a non-Gaussian belief representation by formulating prediction and update as POPs, solved via moment relaxations.
- In linear Gaussian case, GMKF reduces to Kalman filter.

Experiments:
- Batch: BPUE outperforms linear estimator (\BLUE) in non-Gaussian noise.
- Filtering: GMKF outperforms extended, unscented Kalman filters in nonlinear system/non-Gaussian noise.

Overall, key novelty is incorporating higher order moments for state estimation under arbitrary noise distributions, with theoretical analysis + experimental validation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas in the paper:

The paper develops a generalized moment Kalman filter for polynomial systems with arbitrary noise by formulating state estimation as a polynomial optimization problem, relaxing Gaussian assumptions via moment constraints, and propagating sum-of-squares belief representations through prediction and measurement update steps solved via semidefinite programming relaxations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper develops a new approach for state estimation in polynomial systems with arbitrary noise, which commonly arise in robotics applications. The main contributions are:

1) For the batch setup, the paper formulates optimal state estimation as a Polynomial Optimization Problem (POP) and shows how to incorporate higher-order moments of the noise distribution using semidefinite programming relaxations. This leads to the Best Polynomial Unbiased Estimator (BPUE).

2) For the filtering setup, the paper leverages similar ideas to develop the Generalized Moment Kalman Filter (GMKF), which propagates a non-Gaussian belief over time by formulating prediction and update steps as POPs. 

In summary, the key innovation is using semidefinite relaxations to enable Kalman filter-style state estimation that can handle arbitrary noise distributions by matching higher-order moments. Both a batch estimator (BPUE) and recursive filter (GMKF) are developed. The GMKF reduces to the standard Kalman filter in the linear Gaussian case. Experiments demonstrate the improved performance over standard Kalman filtering approaches when noise is highly non-Gaussian.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Polynomial systems - The paper considers dynamical systems described by polynomial equations, common in robotics applications.

- Arbitrary noise - Rather than assuming Gaussian noise, the methods can handle arbitrary noise distributions by specifying a finite number of moments. 

- Batch estimation - A formulation where state estimation is performed using all measurements from initial to current time.

- Best Polynomial Unbiased Estimator (BPUE) - An optimal batch estimator proposed in the paper based on polynomial optimization and moment relaxations.

- Sum-of-squares (SOS) belief - A generalization of a quadratic Gaussian belief to higher-order polynomial terms, represents the estimate's uncertainty.

- Generalized Moment Kalman Filter (GMKF) - A recursive filtering algorithm proposed that propagates an SOS belief over time through prediction and measurement update steps.

- Semidefinite relaxation - Convex relaxation techniques based on semidefinite programming used to approximately solve the non-convex polynomial optimizations.

The key focus areas are polynomial systems, non-Gaussian noise, use of moment relaxations for estimation, and development of batch and recursive estimators with theoretical guarantees.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a Generalized Moment Kalman Filter (GMKF) that extends the standard Kalman filter to polynomial systems with arbitrary noise. How does GMKF capture higher-order moments of the noise distribution compared to standard KF-based methods? What are the advantages and potential limitations?

2. The GMKF formulates the prediction and update steps as Polynomial Optimization Problems (POPs). Explain the moment relaxations used to solve these POPs and why they are preferred over standard non-convex optimization. Under what conditions can we extract optimal solutions?

3. The concept of Sum-of-Squares (SOS) belief is introduced in the paper. Contrast this with the standard Gaussian belief used in Kalman filtering. When does the SOS belief simplify to a Gaussian one? Discuss the interpretation of the matrix Î£ arising in the SOS belief.  

4. The Best Polynomial Unbiased Estimator (BPUE) is proposed for batch state estimation. Derive its connection to the Generalized Method of Moments and contrast it with the standard Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE). When do they produce identical solutions?

5. Theorem 1 connects solutions of the primal moment relaxation to dual SOS polynomials. Explain the proof technique and how it draws inspiration from matrix completion literature. What is the high-level intuition behind this result?

6. In Section IV, approximate estimation error covariances are derived for BPUE. Explain the assumptions made and steps involved in the derivations. How reasonable are these assumptions for real-world robotics applications?

7. The performance of BPUE and GMKF clearly depends on the choice of relaxation order $r$. What are some ways to systematically choose an appropriate value of $r$? Should we always increase $r$ to improve performance?  

8. The prediction step of GMKF requires marginalization of the state. This is what makes proving optimality difficult. Propose some ideas to obtain guarantees or at least tighter bounds on the performance of GMKF.

9. The empirical evaluation focuses only on robot localization. What are some other robotics applications where GMKF could be highly beneficial compared to EKF/UKF? What modifications, if any, would be required?

10. An alternative approach to account for non-Gaussian uncertainties is using sampling-based filters like particle filters. Compare and contrast the proposed GMKF approach with sampling schemes. When might GMKF be more suitable or vice-versa?
