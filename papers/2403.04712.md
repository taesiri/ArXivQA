# [GMKF: Generalized Moment Kalman Filter for Polynomial Systems with   Arbitrary Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- State estimation in nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian noise is challenging. Common approaches like Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) use only the mean and covariance to approximate the belief. This is insufficient for non-Gaussian noise distributions.

- The paper considers polynomial dynamical systems (broad class including nonlinear dynamics and dynamics over Lie groups) with arbitrary noise distributions. Goal is to improve state estimation by incorporating higher order moments to better capture noise distributions.

Contributions:

1) Batch estimation setup (given all measurements up to current time):
- Formulate optimal state estimation as a Polynomial Optimization Problem (POP), while specifying a finite number of noise moments (beyond mean and covariance).
- Solve POP via semidefinite relaxation (moment + sum-of-squares (SOS)).
- Prove that under rank conditions, optimal estimate and an SOS belief representation (generalization of Gaussian) are obtained. This is called Best Polynomial Unbiased Estimator (BPUE).

2) Recursive filtering (GMKF):  
- Based on BPUE insights, propose Generalized Moment Kalman Filter (GMKF) for state estimation in polynomial systems with arbitrary noise.
- GMKF propagates a non-Gaussian belief representation by formulating prediction and update as POPs, solved via moment relaxations.
- In linear Gaussian case, GMKF reduces to Kalman filter.

Experiments:
- Batch: BPUE outperforms linear estimator (\BLUE) in non-Gaussian noise.
- Filtering: GMKF outperforms extended, unscented Kalman filters in nonlinear system/non-Gaussian noise.

Overall, key novelty is incorporating higher order moments for state estimation under arbitrary noise distributions, with theoretical analysis + experimental validation.
