# [Learning to Compress Prompt in Natural Language Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18700)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have limited ability to process long context inputs, which impairs their efficiency and scalability. 
- Existing works compress prompts into soft prompts, but soft prompts have poor transferability across different LLMs.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a framework called "Natural Language Prompt Encapsulation" (Nano-Capsulator) to compress lengthy prompts into shorter natural language "Capsule Prompts".
- Use a semantics preserving loss to retain meaning during compression. 
- Use a reward function with length constraints to optimize utility of compressed prompts.
- Capsule Prompts have concise natural language format for better LLM transferability.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a novel prompt compression framework to reduce prompt lengths by 81.4% into natural language Capsule Prompts.
- Capsule Prompts decrease inference latency by up to 4.5x and cut costs by 80.1% while preserving accuracy.  
- Capsule Prompts have strong transferability across diverse LLMs and unseen downstream datasets.
- Framework is broadly applicable to different types of prompts including few-shot chain of thoughts and reading comprehension passages.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective prompt compression framework to encapsulate lengthy contexts into much shorter natural language Capsule Prompts that have better LLM transferability, preserve utility, and enhance efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a Natural Language Prompt Encapsulation (Nano-Capsulator) framework to compress lengthy prompts into shorter natural language "Capsule Prompts", while maintaining utility and transferability across diverse language models, reducing prompt length by over 80\% and decreasing inference latency up to 4.5x.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper proposes the Natural Language Prompt Encapsulation (Nano-Capsulator) framework to effectively compress long prompts into shorter "Capsule Prompts" that are in natural language format. This allows reducing the context length limitations of large language models (LLMs).

2) The Capsule Prompts generated by Nano-Capsulator can reduce the original prompt length by 81.4% on average. This significantly decreases inference latency by up to 4.5x and cuts budget overheads by 80.1%, while still preserving utility and transferability across diverse LLMs. 

3) Experimental results demonstrate that the Capsule Prompts enable efficient performance across different LLMs. The framework is applicable to both few-shot demonstration chain-of-thought prompts and input content passage prompts for reading comprehension. It also shows strong transferability to unseen datasets with similar downstream tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is an effective prompt compression framework to address context length limitations of LLMs, through generating transferable and usable Capsule Prompts that condense long input prompts. The compressed Capsule Prompts can cut costs and accelerate inference substantially.
