# [Open World Object Detection in the Era of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Open world object detection (OWD) extends models beyond closed-set assumption to detect novel objects and incrementally learn them. However, existing OWD benchmarks use COCO classes as "unknowns" which is unreasonable for foundation models that likely saw extensive supervision of these common objects.

- This creates a discrepancy between benchmark definitions and foundation model capabilities, limiting their utilization in OWD and ability to translate progress to real applications.

Solution - "FOMO":
- Authors propose a new challenging benchmark (RWD) covering 5 datasets from diverse real-world applications like underwater, aerial, medical images. 

- Introduce FOMO which leverages foundation models to detect unknown objects based on known class attributes. It first uses LLMs to generate candidate attributes, then selects/refines them using known class examples to identify attribute-object mappings.  

- During inference, it flags as unknown those proposals in-distribution to attributes but out-of-distribution to known classes.

Contributions:
- Show even basic foundation model methods nearly saturate existing OWD benchmarks, motivating new RWD benchmark

- Curate RWD benchmark with 5 real-world application datasets that is out-of-distribution and challenging

- Propose FOMO that improves unknown mAP by 3x over baselines by exploiting attributes to detect unknown objects related to knowns

- Present first work integrating foundation models into OWD task, but results indicate still substantial room for improvement in scaling detection to real domains
