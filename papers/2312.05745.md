# [Open World Object Detection in the Era of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Open world object detection (OWD) extends models beyond closed-set assumption to detect novel objects and incrementally learn them. However, existing OWD benchmarks use COCO classes as "unknowns" which is unreasonable for foundation models that likely saw extensive supervision of these common objects.

- This creates a discrepancy between benchmark definitions and foundation model capabilities, limiting their utilization in OWD and ability to translate progress to real applications.

Solution - "FOMO":
- Authors propose a new challenging benchmark (RWD) covering 5 datasets from diverse real-world applications like underwater, aerial, medical images. 

- Introduce FOMO which leverages foundation models to detect unknown objects based on known class attributes. It first uses LLMs to generate candidate attributes, then selects/refines them using known class examples to identify attribute-object mappings.  

- During inference, it flags as unknown those proposals in-distribution to attributes but out-of-distribution to known classes.

Contributions:
- Show even basic foundation model methods nearly saturate existing OWD benchmarks, motivating new RWD benchmark

- Curate RWD benchmark with 5 real-world application datasets that is out-of-distribution and challenging

- Propose FOMO that improves unknown mAP by 3x over baselines by exploiting attributes to detect unknown objects related to knowns

- Present first work integrating foundation models into OWD task, but results indicate still substantial room for improvement in scaling detection to real domains


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark and method, FOMO, for evaluating open world object detection with foundation models, showing that existing benchmarks are insufficient and that FOMO improves detection of unknown objects relevant to real-world applications by leveraging attributes connecting known and unknown classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Showing that existing open world object detection (OWD) benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating methods that utilize foundation models, as even naive baselines can achieve near saturation performance on them.

2. Introducing a new and more challenging application-driven benchmark for OWD called Real-World Object Detection (RWD) benchmark, which includes datasets from diverse real-world domains like underwater, aerial, medical, etc.

3. Proposing a novel OWD method called FOMO that identifies unknown objects based on their shared attributes with known classes by utilizing foundation models. 

4. Empirically validating FOMO on the proposed RWD benchmark and showing significant improvements over baselines, with 3x higher unknown mAP and 20% higher known mAP.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) demonstrating limitations of existing OWD benchmarks (2) curating a new challenging benchmark (RWD) (3) proposing a new attribute-based OWD method (FOMO) tailored for foundation models and (4) extensive empirical validation of FOMO showing improved performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Open world object detection (OWD) - The paper focuses on extending object detection methods to handle both known/expected objects as well as unknown/novel objects. 

- Foundation models - The paper investigates leveraging large pre-trained models like CLIP in the open world detection setting.

- Real-world benchmark (RWD) - The paper introduces a new challenging benchmark consisting of datasets from diverse real-world applications like underwater, aerial, medical, etc.

- Attributes - The proposed FOMO method identifies unknown objects based on shared attributes with the known classes, using a language model to generate attribute proposals.

- Few-shot learning - The paper evaluates performance when models are provided with only a small number of examples per class.

- Zero-shot learning - The paper discusses zero-shot detection approaches and evaluates some zero-shot baselines on the new benchmark.

- Modality gap - The paper has to align vision and text-based embeddings due to differences in how concepts are represented.

So in summary, key terms cover open world detection, foundation models, few-shot learning, attributes, real-world benchmarking, and modality gaps.
