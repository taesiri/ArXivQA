# [Learning "Look-Ahead" Nonlocal Traffic Dynamics in a Ring Road](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02770)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents the first study on characterizing and learning the "look-ahead" nonlocal traffic dynamics from real-world data collected in a ring road experiment. The authors adopt a physics-informed neural network approach to learn the optimal fundamental diagram and nonlocal kernel that best fit the traffic data. The results demonstrate the existence of nonlocal phenomena in the data, with the optimal nonlocal kernel having a length of 35-50 meters and over two-thirds of the anticipation effect coming from the leader vehicle. The learned nonlocal LWR model yields significantly more accurate estimations of traffic wave propagations compared to local LWR models across different scenarios. The paper underscores the importance of incorporating appropriate physical priors into machine learning for traffic modeling. Key findings include that look-ahead has a marginal effect on the calibrated fundamental diagram relationship between speed and density, while greatly improving model accuracy in capturing complex spatial-temporal traffic dynamics like stop-and-go oscillations. This pioneering data-driven validation of nonlocal traffic theory opens possibilities for designing anticipative traffic control systems.
