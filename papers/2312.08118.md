# [Neural Radiance Fields for Transparent Object Using Visual Hull](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08118)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for synthesizing novel views of transparent objects using neural radiance fields (NeRF). The key insight is that NeRF struggles with transparent objects because it assumes straight ray paths, whereas light refracts when passing through transparent objects. To address this, the authors first reconstruct a 3D model of the transparent object using visual hull reconstruction from multi-view images and masks. They then simulate ray refraction through the object using Snell's law and surface normals from the reconstruction. Points are sampled along the refracted rays and fed as input to NeRF, which is trained to predict colors and densities for rendering. This allows modeling the distortion and refraction effects of the transparent object. The method is evaluated on real-world transparent object datasets, demonstrating improved rendering quality over standard NeRF. Limitations include inaccuracies from approximate 3D reconstruction and a bound on light bounces modeled. Overall, the work presents an effective approach to adapting NeRF to transparent objects by explicitly modeling ray refraction.
