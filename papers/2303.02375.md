# [NeuDA: Neural Deformable Anchor for High-Fidelity Implicit Surface   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02375)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to reconstruct high-fidelity implicit surfaces from multi-view images. The key hypothesis is that previous methods like NeuS and IDR struggle to capture fine surface details because they do not adequately incorporate spatial context when predicting and rendering the surface. The paper proposes a new method called NeuDA that uses deformable anchors and hierarchical positional encoding to better exploit spatial context information and enable high-fidelity surface reconstruction.In summary, the main research question is how to reconstruct high-quality implicit surfaces, and the key hypothesis is that exploiting spatial context through techniques like deformable anchors will improve reconstruction fidelity compared to previous methods. The experiments aim to validate if NeuDA can reconstruct surfaces with finer detail than NeuS and other state-of-the-art methods.
