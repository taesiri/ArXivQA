# [A Blackbox Model Is All You Need to Breach Privacy: Smart Grid   Forecasting Models as a Use Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01523)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What is the potential for privacy leakage when an adversary gains black box access to a forecasting model trained on private smart grid data?The paper investigates the ability of an adversary to extract sensitive information about the private training data used for a forecasting model by only having black box access to the model. The main hypothesis appears to be that black box forecasting models can leak a significant amount of private information about the training data, similar to what has been shown for classification models in prior work. Specifically, the paper examines whether properties such as the number of occupants, number of children, and types of appliances in a home can be inferred through a black box forecasting model trained on the household's smart meter data. The goal is to quantify the privacy risks of such models even when the adversary has limited access. The attack model assumes the adversary has black box access to the forecasting model, auxiliary data from a similar distribution, and knowledge of the model type but not the hyperparameters or weights.In summary, the central research question is focused on quantifying information leakage from black box forecasting models trained on private smart grid data, in order to analyze the potential privacy risks. The key hypothesis is that these models can reveal substantial sensitive information about users even under limited adversary knowledge.
