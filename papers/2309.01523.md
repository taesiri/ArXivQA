# [A Blackbox Model Is All You Need to Breach Privacy: Smart Grid   Forecasting Models as a Use Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01523)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What is the potential for privacy leakage when an adversary gains black box access to a forecasting model trained on private smart grid data?The paper investigates the ability of an adversary to extract sensitive information about the private training data used for a forecasting model by only having black box access to the model. The main hypothesis appears to be that black box forecasting models can leak a significant amount of private information about the training data, similar to what has been shown for classification models in prior work. Specifically, the paper examines whether properties such as the number of occupants, number of children, and types of appliances in a home can be inferred through a black box forecasting model trained on the household's smart meter data. The goal is to quantify the privacy risks of such models even when the adversary has limited access. The attack model assumes the adversary has black box access to the forecasting model, auxiliary data from a similar distribution, and knowledge of the model type but not the hyperparameters or weights.In summary, the central research question is focused on quantifying information leakage from black box forecasting models trained on private smart grid data, in order to analyze the potential privacy risks. The key hypothesis is that these models can reveal substantial sensitive information about users even under limited adversary knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Proposing a new global properties leakage attack against black box forecasting models. Previous work has focused on attacks against classification models, but this paper develops an attack tailored for forecasting models.2. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the attack in extracting multiple global properties from electricity consumption data in a smart grid setting. The attack is evaluated using a real-world dataset and shows it can reveal properties like number of occupants, appliances, etc. 3. Highlighting the vulnerability of forecasting models to privacy attacks even when model size is smaller than the data size. The results indicate these models can still leak substantial information.4. Underscoring the need for robust security measures to protect forecasting models similar to how the data itself is protected. The paper argues forecasting models should be treated as sensitive sources of information about users.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a new meta classification attack against black box forecasting models, revealing their potential to leak sensitive information about users even with limited access. The paper demonstrates these risks in a smart grid case study and argues for stronger defenses of forecasting models.
