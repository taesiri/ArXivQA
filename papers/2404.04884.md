# [LRNet: Change detection of high-resolution remote sensing imagery via   strategy of localization-then-refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04884)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate discrimination of edge details between change areas and background remains challenging in change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images. Discriminating boundaries of large change areas results in misalignment, while small change targets tend to have interconnected boundaries. This is due to insufficient focus on change features and lack of constraints on edges between change areas and background. Additionally, information loss during pooling in feature extraction affects boundary discrimination.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel network called LRNet based on a localization-then-refinement strategy to address the above issues. LRNet has two stages:

1) Localization Stage: A three-branch encoder extracts features from original images and their differences to progressively localize each change area. Learnable optimal pooling (LOP) is proposed to replace max-pooling to reduce information loss and enable participation in network optimization. Change alignment attention (C2A) and hierarchical change alignment (HCA) modules are proposed to interact change features from different branches and accurately locate change areas of various sizes. 

2) Refinement Stage: The edge-area alignment (E2A) module constrains and refines localization results. By combining C2A-enhanced difference features from deep to shallow, different sized change areas and their edges are refined to obtain accurate results.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a novel LRNet based on localization-then-refinement strategy for accurate change detection, especially edge discrimination.

2) Proposes LOP to reduce information loss in feature extraction and enable participation in network optimization.

3) Proposes C2A and HCA modules to interact change features from different branches and accurately locate change areas of various sizes.

4) Proposes E2A module to constrain and refine localization results for accurate edge discrimination.

5) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets with optimal evaluation metrics and most precise edge discrimination results.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards improving change detection performance, especially edge discrimination, via a localization-then-refinement strategy and novel modules like LOP, C2A, HCA and E2A. The proposed LRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public datasets.
