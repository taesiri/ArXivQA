# [Sample as You Infer: Predictive Coding With Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13664)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel algorithm for training deep generative models based on predictive coding, a popular computational neuroscience framework for modeling perception and learning in the brain. The key idea is to inject Gaussian noise into the predictive coding inference procedure to enable interpretation as an overdamped Langevin sampling method. This facilitates optimization of model parameters with respect to a tight evidence lower bound. The algorithm is improved by incorporating an encoder network to provide amortized warm-starts to the Langevin sampling, with three objectives tested for training the encoder. Additionally, a light-weight diagonal preconditioning method inspired by Riemann manifold Langevin techniques is proposed to increase robustness to step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature. The method is evaluated by training identical generative models using the proposed technique and standard variational autoencoders. Results demonstrate competitive or superior performance across metrics like sample quality and diversity, while converging much faster in terms of SGD iterations. Overall, the paper successfully integrates predictive coding with insights from gradient-based MCMC sampling to develop a powerful and efficient algorithm for deep generative modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel algorithm for training deep generative models based on predictive coding that injects Gaussian noise into the inference procedure to enable Langevin sampling for optimization of a tight evidence lower bound.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Showing that by injecting appropriately scaled Gaussian noise into the standard predictive coding (PC) inference procedure, it can be interpreted as an unadjusted overdamped Langevin sampling algorithm. This facilitates optimisation with respect to a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO).

2) Improving the resultant encoder-free training method by incorporating an encoder network to provide an amortised warm-start to the Langevin sampling. The paper evaluates three different objectives for training this encoder: the forward KL, reverse KL and Jeffrey's divergence. 

3) Validating a lightweight diagonal preconditioning strategy inspired by Riemann Manifold Langevin and adaptive optimizers from the SGD literature. This is shown to increase robustness to the Langevin step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature.

4) Comparing the proposed Langevin PC training algorithm against VAEs by training like-for-like generative models. The results show the Langevin PC method matches or exceeds VAE performance across several metrics, while converging much faster in terms of number of SGD iterations.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel training algorithm for deep generative models based on predictive coding and Langevin dynamics that is competitive or better than VAE training in various aspects.

- Preconditioning - A light-weight diagonal preconditioner inspired by RMSProp is introduced to increase robustness to the Langevin step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature.

- Evidence lower bound (ELBO) - A bound on the log-likelihood that can be optimized using Langevin sample gradients. Used as training objective instead of log joint at MAP estimate.

- Generative modeling - The overall goal is training deep generative models, with comparisons made to VAEs. The proposed Langevin PC approach matches or exceeds VAE performance across various metrics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces noise injection into the standard predictive coding framework to facilitate Langevin sampling. How does the resultant algorithm compare to other MCMC-based approaches for training deep generative models? What are some of the potential advantages or disadvantages?

7. The paper uses an overdamped Langevin scheme. How might adopting underdamped Langevin dynamics or Hamiltonian dynamics affect the overall results? What hyperparameter tuning is required?

8. What theoretical guarantees can be provided regarding the convergence or approximation quality of the Langevin predictive coding algorithm to the true posterior distribution?

9. How does the sample quality and diversity compare to other state-of-the-art generative modeling techniques like GANs or diffusion models? What metrics should be used to quantify performance?

10. The methodology has connections to theories of neural computation and the Bayesian brain. What predictions arise from this work and how might they be tested or validated via experiments?
