# [Instance Neural Radiance Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04395)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can we perform 3D instance segmentation in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) without using ground-truth segmentation labels during inference?The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposes a new method called Instance-NeRF (iNeRF) to do 3D instance segmentation in NeRF scenes. - Uses a proposal-based 3D mask prediction network (NeRF-RCNN) to generate coarse 3D instance masks from a pretrained NeRF scene.- Projects the 3D masks to 2D and matches them to consistent instance labels from an off-the-shelf 2D segmentation model. Uses this to train an instance field in NeRF to produce continuous 3D instance segmentation.- One of the first learning-based approaches to do 3D instance segmentation in NeRF without ground truth segmentation, and shows strong performance on complex indoor scenes.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that they can achieve 3D instance segmentation in NeRF scenes during inference without ground truth segmentation supervision by leveraging 2D segmentation and proposing a method to generate consistent labels across views.
