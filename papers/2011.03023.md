# [Language Model is All You Need: Natural Language Understanding as   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03023)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether natural language understanding (NLU) problems can be effectively mapped to question answering (QA) problems, especially in low data regimes, to leverage transfer learning from QA models. The key hypothesis is that framing NLU as QA will enable significant performance improvements in few-shot and low-resource settings compared to standard approaches like sentence classification and token tagging.The paper proposes an approach called QANLU where NLU data is converted to QA style data with questions and answers created based on the intent and slot annotations. QA models pretrained on QA datasets are then fine-tuned on this converted NLU data. The hypothesis is that this allows transfer learning from the QA task that the model has been pretrained on.The main experiments then evaluate QANLU versus standard classification and tagging approaches in few-shot settings on the ATIS and Restaurants datasets. The results generally validate the hypothesis, showing clear benefits to the QA framing in low data regimes. Additional experiments also demonstrate how QANLU enables effective transfer learning across NLU domains.So in summary, the central research question is whether NLU can be improved, especially in low resource scenarios, by mapping it to QA to leverage transfer learning. The paper provides evidence that this QA framing delivers significant gains over conventional methods when data is limited.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing an approach for natural language understanding (NLU) by mapping NLU tasks like intent and slot detection to question answering (QA). Specifically:- They propose Question Answering for Natural Language Understanding (QANLU), where they construct QA style datasets from intent and slot annotated data. This allows transferring knowledge from QA to intent and slot detection tasks.- They show that QANLU significantly outperforms standard intent and slot classification methods in low-resource and few-shot settings, with improvements up to 60% in some cases.- They demonstrate that QANLU enables effective transfer learning for intent and slot detection across domains. Fine-tuning a QA model on one domain and then another domain improves performance by over 50% compared to training only on the target domain. - They find that augmenting QA training data with QANLU data further improves QA model performance, suggesting bidirectional transfer between QA and NLU is possible.In summary, the key contribution is using QA as a canonical task to transfer knowledge to other NLU problems, especially when training data is scarce. The paper shows this is an effective approach and establishes QANLU as a strong few-shot NLU method.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper introduces Question Answering for Natural Language Understanding (QANLU), an approach for intent detection and slot filling that frames these tasks as question answering. The key points are:- QANLU maps intent and slot detection to QA by creating questions and answers from annotated NLU data. - Models pretrained on QA are fine-tuned on the QA version of NLU data. This transfers knowledge from QA to intent/slot detection.- QANLU significantly outperforms standard approaches like token classification for intent/slot detection in low resource settings.- QANLU enables effective transfer learning for intent/slot detection across domains.- Augmenting QA data with NLU-derived questions/answers improves QA model performance.  In summary, the paper shows QA is an effective canonical task for transfer learning in NLU, reducing data needs and enabling cross-domain transfer.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on natural language understanding (NLU) and transfer learning:- The main contribution is using question answering (QA) as a framework for NLU and showing the effectiveness of transfer learning from QA to NLU tasks, especially in low data regimes. Most prior work on NLU uses separate models for intent classification and slot tagging. Framing NLU as QA is a novel approach.- They show substantially better performance on ATIS and Restaurants datasets compared to standard NLU models in few-shot settings. For example, on ATIS their model with only 20 examples outperforms token classification models by over 20% absolute F1. This demonstrates the power of transfer learning from pre-trained QA models.- They set a new state-of-the-art on slot detection on Restaurants-8k dataset, outperforming prior methods like Span-ConveRT. With only 20 examples their model reaches higher F1 than Span-ConveRT with 256 examples.- They also show gains from sequential transfer learning across NLU tasks by first training on ATIS and then fine-tuning on Restaurants dataset. This demonstrates transferability across domains.- Overall, the key novelties are using QA for NLU, and quantitatively showing the effectiveness for low-resource situations and transfer learning. This is a promising direction for handling data scarcity issues in NLU.- One limitation is that they only experiment with span-based QA, while other QA formulations like multiple choice may be applicable too. Their approach is also evaluated on just 2 datasets, so more extensive testing on diverse NLU data would be useful.In summary, framing NLU as QA and transferring from pre-trained QA models is innovative compared to standard practice, and enables significant performance gains in few-shot settings. The transfer learning approach could help address data scarcity challenges in NLU.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Going beyond span detection QA and the SQuAD2.0 dataset, and expanding experiments across different NLP tasks to further evaluate the effectiveness of mapping tasks to QA.- Measuring how much transfer of knowledge can be achieved by mapping different NLP tasks to QA. This could help quantify the benefits of using QA as a canonical task.- Studying how questions for QANLU models can be automatically generated based on context, rather than manually created. This could make the approach more scalable.- Further exploring if QA can serve as an "oracle" to transfer knowledge to other NLP tasks, especially in low-resource settings.- Evaluating if the QA data augmentation approach they tested can consistently improve QA model performance. This could provide a method for mutual transfer learning between QA and NLP tasks.- Expanding the QANLU approach to other types of QA systems beyond span detection models.- Testing QANLU on a wider range of NLP tasks and domains beyond those explored in the paper.- Developing methods to further improve the sequential transfer learning they demonstrate from one NLU domain to another using QANLU.In summary, the main future directions are developing QANLU into a more general framework for transfer learning in NLP, evaluating it on more tasks, and finding ways to automate and improve aspects of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents Question Answering for Natural Language Understanding (QANLU), an approach that maps natural language understanding tasks like intent detection and slot filling to question answering. QANLU transforms intent and slot labels in an utterance into question-answer pairs that are fed to a pre-trained QA model. This allows transfer learning from QA to boost performance on NLU, especially in low-resource settings. Experiments on ATIS and Restaurants-8k datasets show QANLU significantly outperforms standard classification baselines in few-shot settings. QANLU also enables effective transfer learning across NLU domains through fine-tuning on sequential tasks. Overall, the paper demonstrates that framing NLU as QA leads to substantial gains in low-data regimes and establishes a new state-of-the-art for slot filling on Restaurants-8k. The results indicate QA may be a suitable canonical task for transfer learning across NLU domains.
