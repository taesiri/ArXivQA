# [Skipper: Improving the Reach and Fidelity of Quantum Annealers by   Skipping Long Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00264)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two software techniques called Skipper and Skipper-G to enhance both the capacity and reliability of quantum annealers (QAs). QAs face limited connectivity between qubits, requiring multiple physical qubits to be chained together to represent a program qubit. However, a few dominant chains contain far more qubits than others, following a power-law distribution, and about 25% of qubits remain unused as they get trapped between chains. Skipper strategically prunes these dominant chains, replacing them with two measurement outcomes to free up qubits trapped in long chains. Experiments on a 5761-qubit D-Wave QA show Skipper can solve problems up to 59% larger on average and improve reliability by up to 44% when cutting 5 or 11 chains, respectively. However, Skipper requires running many QA executables. Skipper-G uses a greedy depth-first search to bypass subspaces unlikely to contain the optimum, needing only 23 QA runs even with 11 chain cuts. Skipper-G provides most of the reliability gains of Skipper, boosting it by 41% on average, using far fewer QA runs. In summary, the proposed techniques enhance QAs' capacity and reliability by eliminating dominant chains that severely underutilize qubits and degrade performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Skipper and Skipper-G, software techniques to enhance the capacity and fidelity of quantum annealers by strategically pruning dominant qubit chains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Skipper, a software technique to enhance the capacity and fidelity of quantum annealers (QAs) by strategically skipping dominant qubit chains. Experiments show Skipper can solve problems up to 59% larger on average and improve QA fidelity by up to 44% on average.

2. It introduces Skipper-G, a greedy version of Skipper that reduces the quantum cost while still enhancing QA fidelity, although by a slightly smaller amount than Skipper. Skipper-G runs at most 23 quantum executables compared to a potential 2048 for Skipper.

3. It provides insights into the non-uniformity of chain lengths in QAs, showing they follow a power-law distribution with a few dominant chains being much longer than most chains. It also shows ~25% of QA qubits remain unused as they get trapped by long chains.

4. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposals across a range of graph types from sparse to almost fully connected. In contrast to prior work like FrozenQubits, performance is maintained regardless of graph density.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating Skipper and Skipper-G to enhance the capacity and fidelity of quantum annealers in a way that works across diverse graph topologies.

The paper introduces "Skipper", a software technique to improve the capacity and fidelity of quantum annealers by strategically eliminating dominant chains, which utilize a large number of physical qubits. It also proposes "Skipper-G", a greedy version of Skipper that reduces the quantum execution cost. The key ideas revolve around the non-uniform distribution of chain lengths, underutilization of physical qubits, and exploring sub-spaces by cutting chains in an intelligent fashion.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) What is the key insight behind the proposed Skipper method? Why does it focus specifically on dominant chains in quantum annealers?

2) How does Skipper simultaneously enhance both the capacity and fidelity of quantum annealers? What is the trade-off involved?

3) Explain the process of how Skipper identifies and decides which dominant chains to eliminate. What factors make this a nontrivial task? 

4) What is the significance of allowing users to specify the number of chain cuts in Skipper? How does this provide flexibility and affect performance?

5) What postprocessing strategies does Skipper employ to handle issues like broken chains and balanced chains during the unembedding process? How do these strategies work?

6) Analyze the time complexity of Skipper - explain both the classical and quantum overhead. How do factors like number of trials, edges, embedding time etc. contribute?

7) How exactly does the Skipper-G variant reduce the quantum cost of basic Skipper? What trade-offs are involved in terms of performance and search capability?

8) Critically evaluate the branch and bound criteria used in Skipper-G to assess subproblem quality and likelihood of finding the global optimum. What metrics are used and why?  

9) Compare and contrast the workflows of Skipper and Skipper-G, analyzing factors like embedding time, queuing delays, classical pre/post processing etc. How do these affect overall runtime?

10) While Skipper shows clear advantages for quantum annealers, explain why it cannot be effectively employed to enhance optimization techniques in the classical domain. What are the fundamental differences?
