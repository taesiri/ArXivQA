# [Skipper: Improving the Reach and Fidelity of Quantum Annealers by   Skipping Long Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00264)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two software techniques called Skipper and Skipper-G to enhance both the capacity and reliability of quantum annealers (QAs). QAs face limited connectivity between qubits, requiring multiple physical qubits to be chained together to represent a program qubit. However, a few dominant chains contain far more qubits than others, following a power-law distribution, and about 25% of qubits remain unused as they get trapped between chains. Skipper strategically prunes these dominant chains, replacing them with two measurement outcomes to free up qubits trapped in long chains. Experiments on a 5761-qubit D-Wave QA show Skipper can solve problems up to 59% larger on average and improve reliability by up to 44% when cutting 5 or 11 chains, respectively. However, Skipper requires running many QA executables. Skipper-G uses a greedy depth-first search to bypass subspaces unlikely to contain the optimum, needing only 23 QA runs even with 11 chain cuts. Skipper-G provides most of the reliability gains of Skipper, boosting it by 41% on average, using far fewer QA runs. In summary, the proposed techniques enhance QAs' capacity and reliability by eliminating dominant chains that severely underutilize qubits and degrade performance.
