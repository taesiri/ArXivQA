# [NUMTEMP: A real-world benchmark to verify claims with statistical and   temporal expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fact checking is important to combat misinformation, but manual fact checking has limited scalability. Automated fact checking has made progress, but most datasets focus on verifying textual rather than numerical claims.
- Numerical claims are common (e.g. 36% of claims in US presidential debates involve numbers/dates) and lend false credibility. Verifying them requires analyzing quantities in the claim and evidence.  
- Existing datasets inadequately address verifying numerical claims. Synthetic datasets don't reflect real distribution. Real-world datasets collect non-numerical claims or have minimal numerical claims.

Proposed Solution:
- Authors collect and release a dataset of 15,514 real-world numerical claims from 45 fact checking sites, with metadata and 443,320 evidence snippets from the web.
- Evidence collection uses both original claims and questions from claim decomposition methods as queries to increase diversity. Results from fact checking sites are excluded to prevent label leakage.
- A baseline fact checking pipeline is proposed using claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via BM25 and re-ranking, and fine-tuned NLI models for veracity prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Largest real-world dataset for verifying numerical claims with temporal expressions and statistics.
- Evaluation of claim decomposition techniques and NLI models shows models focused on numerical understanding outperform generic models.
- Analysis across claim types and error analysis reveals limitations - conflicting claims are hardest with highest potential for improvement.
- Claim decomposition is shown to improve evidence retrieval and verification performance compared to using just original claims.

In summary, the paper releases a valuable numerical claim dataset to drive progress in this important but under-addressed area of automated fact checking research. Both the dataset construction process and proposed baseline fact checking pipeline offer useful insights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces NumTemp, a new dataset of 15,514 real-world numerical and temporal claims from 45 fact-checking sites to evaluate automated fact-checking methods, finding that claim decomposition and models specialized in numerical understanding improve performance in verifying such claims compared to generic models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors collect and release a large, diverse multi-domain dataset of 15,514 real-world numerical claims for fact-checking, which is the first dataset of its kind focused specifically on verifying numerical claims. 

2. They evaluate established fact-checking pipelines and claim decomposition methods on this new dataset, examining their effectiveness in handling numerical claims. They also propose improved baselines for the natural language inference (NLI) step.

3. Their findings reveal that NLI models pre-trained for numerical understanding outperform generic models in fact-checking numerical claims by up to 11.78%. They also show that smaller models fine-tuned on numerical claims can outperform larger models like GPT-3.5-Turbo.

4. They assess the quality of questions decomposed by ClaimDecomp and ProgramFC for numerical claims, using both automated metrics and manual evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of a new challenging benchmark dataset for verifying real-world numerical claims, along with analysis of various state-of-the-art models on this data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called NumTemp for verifying numerical claims. What are some key differences between NumTemp and existing datasets for fact checking? How does the focus on numerical claims make NumTemp more challenging?

2. The paper proposes a pipeline for fact checking numerical claims involving claim decomposition and natural language inference (NLI). What are the advantages of using claim decomposition compared to just using the original claim text? How does it help in evidence retrieval and verification?  

3. The paper evaluates various NLI models including FlanT5, GPT-3.5 Turbo, RoBERTa, and models focused on numerical reasoning like NumT5 and FinQA-Roberta. What differences did you observe in the performance of these models on NumTemp? Why do you think the numerical reasoning models performed better?

4. The paper categorizes numerical claims into four types - statistical, temporal, interval and comparison claims. Which category of claims was the most challenging for the baseline methods? What kinds of reasoning do you think is needed to improve performance on those claims?

5. Both ClaimDecomp and ProgramFC methods are used for claim decomposition. How does the paper evaluate the quality of the generated questions from these methods, both through automated metrics and manual analysis? What differences did you notice between them?

6. What were some common error scenarios observed during the error analysis of the baseline method's predictions? What insights did that provide about the limitations of current claim verification pipelines? 

7. The paper collects evidence from Google search along with claim decomposition questions. Do you think there could be further improvements by enhancing evidence retrieval, ranking and selection stages? What approaches can you suggest?

8. The paper uses both generative and fine-tuning based NLI models. Under what conditions did generative models like GPT-3.5 Turbo underperform compared to fine-tuned classifiers? When is each approach more suitable?

9. What are some risks and ethical considerations around using the baseline system proposed in real-world fact checking scenarios? How can those risks be mitigated?

10. The paper identifies some key limitations like the lack of thorough evaluation of evidence retrieval process. What validation experiments would you suggest to analyze that process and determine optimal configurations?
