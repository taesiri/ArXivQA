# [HoloFusion: Towards Photo-realistic 3D Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14244)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is: How can we take an existing low-resolution 3D diffusion generator and augment it to produce high-fidelity, photo-realistic 3D models by leveraging and distilling from an additional high-resolution 2D diffusion model?In particular, the paper proposes a method called HoloFusion that combines a coarse 3D diffusion model called HoloDiffusion with a super-resolution 2D diffusion model. The key ideas are:1. Start with a low-resolution 3D sample from HoloDiffusion. 2. Render and super-resolve multiple views independently using the 2D diffusion model to add detail.3. Distill and fuse the detailed 2D views back into a single coherent high-resolution 3D model.The main hypothesis seems to be that this hybrid approach can produce better results than using either the 3D or 2D diffusion models alone, and that the coarse 3D structure from HoloDiffusion provides enough consistency for the independent 2D super-resolution and distillation to work effectively. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by comparing HoloFusion to various baselines.So in summary, the key research question is how to effectively combine coarse 3D and detailed 2D diffusion models in a mutually beneficial way to achieve higher quality 3D generation than possible with either alone. The paper proposes HoloFusion as a solution and validates the approach experimentally.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel hybrid method called HoloFusion for generating high-quality, view-consistent 3D models from multi-view 2D images. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Starts from a base 3D diffusion model called HoloDiffusion that produces low-resolution but view-consistent 3D samples.- Augments it with a lightweight 2D super-resolution network that is trained jointly to upsample the rendered views from HoloDiffusion.- Distills the upsampled views into a consolidated high-quality 3D representation while ensuring consistency. This uses a new patch-based distillation loss.- Achieves state-of-the-art view-consistent 3D generation on real datasets like CO3Dv2, outperforming prior generative and distillation baselines.In summary, the main contribution is presenting a complete pipeline to go from multi-view 2D images to high-fidelity 3D models by combining strengths of diffusion, super-resolution, and distillation in a principled and robust manner. The method and results are a step forward for 3D generative modeling using real image data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents HoloFusion, a hybrid diffusion-based method to generate high-fidelity, view-consistent 3D objects from only 2D image supervision, by combining coarse 3D generation, independent 2D super-resolution, and robust multi-view distillation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key comparisons between this paper and other related work on 3D generative modeling using diffusion models:- This paper builds on HoloDiffusion (Karnewar et al. CVPR 2023), which was the first method to train a 3D diffusion model directly from 2D images. However, HoloDiffusion produces low-resolution outputs. This paper proposes HoloFusion to greatly improve the output fidelity by incorporating an image diffusion super-resolution network and robust distillation process.- Other recent works like DreamFusion (Poole et al. 2022) and Magic3D (Lin et al. 2022) also aim to obtain high-fidelity 3D outputs by distilling 2D image diffusion models. However, without explicit 3D supervision, they can produce geometrically inconsistent results. HoloFusion preserves consistency by starting from a coarse 3D model. - Some concurrent works like NeRFDiff (Gu et al. 2023), RealFusion (Melas et al. 2023), and SparseFusion (Zhou et al. 2022) also combine 2D diffusion models with 3D-based rendering for high quality image synthesis or 3D reconstruction from images. HoloFusion focuses on unconditional 3D generation rather than reconstruction.- Many recent 3D GANs like pi-GAN, EG3D, and GRAF have produced high quality images, but may lack full 3D consistency. HoloFusion matches their image quality while ensuring geometric consistency.- Compared to works that train 3D diffusion models on synthetic 3D data, HoloFusion is trained from only 2D real images, which is more challenging but produces more realistic results.In summary, HoloFusion advances unconditional 3D generation from images to produce both high fidelity and 3D consistent outputs, combining strengths from both 3D and 2D diffusion models in a simple and effective framework. The high quality results on complex real data demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing methods to directly distill a set of super-resolved images without requiring explicit optimization during inference. The current approach in the paper requires slow optimization during sampling to consolidate the super-resolved views, so removing this could make sampling faster.- Incorporating explicit surface representations like meshes into the framework. The current method produces a voxel grid representation. Using a mesh could allow for higher resolution and quality.- Adding support for conditional generation, where the 3D shape is guided by text or other control signals. The current method is unconditional. Conditional generation could make it more controllable.- Exploring alternative 3D representations besides voxels that can scale better to higher resolutions while retaining amenability to diffusion training.- Applying the hybrid diffusion distillation approach to additional datasets beyond the objects used in the paper. Testing on more complex and diverse data could better demonstrate the general applicability.- Extending the framework to generate composed scenes with multiple objects, backgrounds, etc. rather than just single isolated objects.- Improving training stability and mode collapse issues when applied to challenging unaligned multiview datasets like Co3D.- Reducing sampling time, which currently takes around 30 minutes per 3D sample. This could improve practicality.In summary, the main directions are developing conditional generation capabilities, using more scalable surface-based representations, improving training stability, and increasing the efficiency and applicability to complex scenes. The overall goal is to build on the hybrid diffusion distillation approach to achieve higher quality and fidelity across diverse datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes HoloFusion, a method to generate high-quality 3D radiance fields from collections of multi-view 2D images. It first uses a variant of HoloDiffusion to generate low-resolution 3D samples. It then independently renders and upsamples multiple views of the coarse 3D model using a super-resolution network, adding detail to the renders. Finally, it distills the super-resolved views into a single high-fidelity 3D radiance field representation to ensure view consistency. The super-resolution network is trained end-to-end as part of HoloFusion. Experiments on the CO3Dv2 dataset show it achieves higher quality and more realistic outputs compared to methods like DreamFusion, Get3D, EG3D and HoloDiffusion itself. The key findings are that the loose 3D coordination from the coarse model combined with robust distillation of independently super-resolved views can produce high quality, view-consistent 3D generations not achievable by prior work.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a method called \name for generating high-fidelity 3D models from collections of 2D images. The method first uses a variant of HoloDiffusion to generate a low-resolution 3D sample. It then renders multiple views of this coarse 3D model, independently super-resolves them using a 2D diffusion model to add detail, and distills these detailed views back into a single high-resolution 3D model. The key ideas are (1) integrating a lightweight 2D super-resolution network into the 3D diffusion model and training it end-to-end, (2) generating multiple super-resolved hypotheses per view to handle ambiguity, and (3) distilling with a patch-remixing scheme to consolidate consistent details across views.  Experiments on the CO3D dataset show this approach outperforms baselines like PiGAN, EG3D, GET3D, HoloDiffusion, and text-to-3D distillation with Stable-DreamFusion. The method achieves higher-fidelity results by effectively combining the benefits of consistent low-resolution 3D diffusion with independent 2D super-resolution. Ablations verify the contributions of the main technical components. The resulting 3D consistent, diverse, detailed generations outperform prior work on this challenging real-image dataset.
