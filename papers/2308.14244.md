# [HoloFusion: Towards Photo-realistic 3D Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14244)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is: How can we take an existing low-resolution 3D diffusion generator and augment it to produce high-fidelity, photo-realistic 3D models by leveraging and distilling from an additional high-resolution 2D diffusion model?In particular, the paper proposes a method called HoloFusion that combines a coarse 3D diffusion model called HoloDiffusion with a super-resolution 2D diffusion model. The key ideas are:1. Start with a low-resolution 3D sample from HoloDiffusion. 2. Render and super-resolve multiple views independently using the 2D diffusion model to add detail.3. Distill and fuse the detailed 2D views back into a single coherent high-resolution 3D model.The main hypothesis seems to be that this hybrid approach can produce better results than using either the 3D or 2D diffusion models alone, and that the coarse 3D structure from HoloDiffusion provides enough consistency for the independent 2D super-resolution and distillation to work effectively. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by comparing HoloFusion to various baselines.So in summary, the key research question is how to effectively combine coarse 3D and detailed 2D diffusion models in a mutually beneficial way to achieve higher quality 3D generation than possible with either alone. The paper proposes HoloFusion as a solution and validates the approach experimentally.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel hybrid method called HoloFusion for generating high-quality, view-consistent 3D models from multi-view 2D images. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Starts from a base 3D diffusion model called HoloDiffusion that produces low-resolution but view-consistent 3D samples.- Augments it with a lightweight 2D super-resolution network that is trained jointly to upsample the rendered views from HoloDiffusion.- Distills the upsampled views into a consolidated high-quality 3D representation while ensuring consistency. This uses a new patch-based distillation loss.- Achieves state-of-the-art view-consistent 3D generation on real datasets like CO3Dv2, outperforming prior generative and distillation baselines.In summary, the main contribution is presenting a complete pipeline to go from multi-view 2D images to high-fidelity 3D models by combining strengths of diffusion, super-resolution, and distillation in a principled and robust manner. The method and results are a step forward for 3D generative modeling using real image data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents HoloFusion, a hybrid diffusion-based method to generate high-fidelity, view-consistent 3D objects from only 2D image supervision, by combining coarse 3D generation, independent 2D super-resolution, and robust multi-view distillation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key comparisons between this paper and other related work on 3D generative modeling using diffusion models:- This paper builds on HoloDiffusion (Karnewar et al. CVPR 2023), which was the first method to train a 3D diffusion model directly from 2D images. However, HoloDiffusion produces low-resolution outputs. This paper proposes HoloFusion to greatly improve the output fidelity by incorporating an image diffusion super-resolution network and robust distillation process.- Other recent works like DreamFusion (Poole et al. 2022) and Magic3D (Lin et al. 2022) also aim to obtain high-fidelity 3D outputs by distilling 2D image diffusion models. However, without explicit 3D supervision, they can produce geometrically inconsistent results. HoloFusion preserves consistency by starting from a coarse 3D model. - Some concurrent works like NeRFDiff (Gu et al. 2023), RealFusion (Melas et al. 2023), and SparseFusion (Zhou et al. 2022) also combine 2D diffusion models with 3D-based rendering for high quality image synthesis or 3D reconstruction from images. HoloFusion focuses on unconditional 3D generation rather than reconstruction.- Many recent 3D GANs like pi-GAN, EG3D, and GRAF have produced high quality images, but may lack full 3D consistency. HoloFusion matches their image quality while ensuring geometric consistency.- Compared to works that train 3D diffusion models on synthetic 3D data, HoloFusion is trained from only 2D real images, which is more challenging but produces more realistic results.In summary, HoloFusion advances unconditional 3D generation from images to produce both high fidelity and 3D consistent outputs, combining strengths from both 3D and 2D diffusion models in a simple and effective framework. The high quality results on complex real data demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach.
