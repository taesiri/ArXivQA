# [HoloFusion: Towards Photo-realistic 3D Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14244)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is: How can we take an existing low-resolution 3D diffusion generator and augment it to produce high-fidelity, photo-realistic 3D models by leveraging and distilling from an additional high-resolution 2D diffusion model?In particular, the paper proposes a method called HoloFusion that combines a coarse 3D diffusion model called HoloDiffusion with a super-resolution 2D diffusion model. The key ideas are:1. Start with a low-resolution 3D sample from HoloDiffusion. 2. Render and super-resolve multiple views independently using the 2D diffusion model to add detail.3. Distill and fuse the detailed 2D views back into a single coherent high-resolution 3D model.The main hypothesis seems to be that this hybrid approach can produce better results than using either the 3D or 2D diffusion models alone, and that the coarse 3D structure from HoloDiffusion provides enough consistency for the independent 2D super-resolution and distillation to work effectively. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by comparing HoloFusion to various baselines.So in summary, the key research question is how to effectively combine coarse 3D and detailed 2D diffusion models in a mutually beneficial way to achieve higher quality 3D generation than possible with either alone. The paper proposes HoloFusion as a solution and validates the approach experimentally.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel hybrid method called HoloFusion for generating high-quality, view-consistent 3D models from multi-view 2D images. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Starts from a base 3D diffusion model called HoloDiffusion that produces low-resolution but view-consistent 3D samples.- Augments it with a lightweight 2D super-resolution network that is trained jointly to upsample the rendered views from HoloDiffusion.- Distills the upsampled views into a consolidated high-quality 3D representation while ensuring consistency. This uses a new patch-based distillation loss.- Achieves state-of-the-art view-consistent 3D generation on real datasets like CO3Dv2, outperforming prior generative and distillation baselines.In summary, the main contribution is presenting a complete pipeline to go from multi-view 2D images to high-fidelity 3D models by combining strengths of diffusion, super-resolution, and distillation in a principled and robust manner. The method and results are a step forward for 3D generative modeling using real image data.
