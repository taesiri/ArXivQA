# [Textual Prompt Guided Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06162)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image degradation during capture is common due to factors like noise, haze, rain etc. While methods exist to restore images for specific degradations, developing a single model that can handle multiple arbitrary degradations blindly is difficult. This requires accurately identifying the degradation for effective restoration.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes TextPromptIR, a textual prompt guided image restoration model. It has two main stages - first it uses a fine-tuned BERT model to understand user provided textual prompt to identify degradation type. Second is a backbone CNN model that utilizes this textual guidance along with image features for restoration using proposed integrated transformer blocks.

Key Details:
- Task-specific BERT is fine-tuned on collected textual prompts to generate textual guidance embeddings.
- Backbone network has encoder-decoder structure with proposed Integrated Multi-head Transposed Attention (IMTA) and Integrated Gated Feedforward Convolution (IGFN) blocks at each level. 
- Textual guidance is integrated with visual features in IMTA and IGFN blocks using cross-modal interactions for accurate degradation identification and removal.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first textual prompt guided image restoration model that can handle multiple degradations in an unified framework.
- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on image denoising, deraining and dehazing datasets. 
- Provides interpretable textual control over image restoration process.
- Introduces textual prompt based interaction for low-level vision tasks.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative text-guided model for blind image restoration that can accurately restore images based on user textual prompt while handling multiple arbitrary degradations robustly.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an effective textual prompt guided blind image restoration network that can achieve accurate recognition and removal of various image degradations within a unified framework, without increasing model complexity. 

2. It designs depth-wise multi-head transposed attentions and gated convolution modules to effectively bridge the gap between textual prompts and visual features.

3. It innovatively introduces textual prompts into the low-level visual domain and contributes an auxiliary multi-modal image restoration dataset. This highlights the potential for providing a natural, precise and controllable interaction way for future low-level vision research.

4. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks for denoising, deraining and dehazing tasks. The proposed method also provides interpretable attention visualizations to validate the precise degradation removal guided by textual prompts.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective text-guided image restoration framework that can accurately perform multiple restoration tasks based on textual prompting, without increasing model complexity. This opens up new possibilities for multimodal interaction in low-level vision.
