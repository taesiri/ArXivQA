# [Textual Prompt Guided Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06162)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image degradation during capture is common due to factors like noise, haze, rain etc. While methods exist to restore images for specific degradations, developing a single model that can handle multiple arbitrary degradations blindly is difficult. This requires accurately identifying the degradation for effective restoration.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes TextPromptIR, a textual prompt guided image restoration model. It has two main stages - first it uses a fine-tuned BERT model to understand user provided textual prompt to identify degradation type. Second is a backbone CNN model that utilizes this textual guidance along with image features for restoration using proposed integrated transformer blocks.

Key Details:
- Task-specific BERT is fine-tuned on collected textual prompts to generate textual guidance embeddings.
- Backbone network has encoder-decoder structure with proposed Integrated Multi-head Transposed Attention (IMTA) and Integrated Gated Feedforward Convolution (IGFN) blocks at each level. 
- Textual guidance is integrated with visual features in IMTA and IGFN blocks using cross-modal interactions for accurate degradation identification and removal.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first textual prompt guided image restoration model that can handle multiple degradations in an unified framework.
- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on image denoising, deraining and dehazing datasets. 
- Provides interpretable textual control over image restoration process.
- Introduces textual prompt based interaction for low-level vision tasks.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative text-guided model for blind image restoration that can accurately restore images based on user textual prompt while handling multiple arbitrary degradations robustly.
