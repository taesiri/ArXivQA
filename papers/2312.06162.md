## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TextPromptIR, an effective textual prompt guided image restoration model for blind image restoration. It introduces semantic prompts from users to help the model accurately recognize and remove different types of degradations within a unified framework, without increasing model complexity. The method has two stages - first, a task-specific BERT is fine-tuned to understand textual instructions and generate semantic prompts. Second, a backbone network with multi-level integrated transformer blocks leverages the textual prompts to bridge the gap between text and images, facilitating degradation identification and restoration. Depth-wise multi-head transposed attentions and gated convolutions are specifically designed to integrate textual and visual features. Experiments on image denoising, deraining and dehazing benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. TextPromptIR highlights the potential of providing a natural, precise and controllable way to perform image restoration via multimodal human-computer interaction. Key innovations include introducing textual prompts to low-level vision and effectively utilizing them to guide restoration.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image degradation during capture is common due to factors like noise, haze, rain etc. While methods exist to restore images for specific degradations, developing a single model that can handle multiple arbitrary degradations blindly is difficult. This requires accurately identifying the degradation for effective restoration.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes TextPromptIR, a textual prompt guided image restoration model. It has two main stages - first it uses a fine-tuned BERT model to understand user provided textual prompt to identify degradation type. Second is a backbone CNN model that utilizes this textual guidance along with image features for restoration using proposed integrated transformer blocks.

Key Details:
- Task-specific BERT is fine-tuned on collected textual prompts to generate textual guidance embeddings.
- Backbone network has encoder-decoder structure with proposed Integrated Multi-head Transposed Attention (IMTA) and Integrated Gated Feedforward Convolution (IGFN) blocks at each level. 
- Textual guidance is integrated with visual features in IMTA and IGFN blocks using cross-modal interactions for accurate degradation identification and removal.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first textual prompt guided image restoration model that can handle multiple degradations in an unified framework.
- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on image denoising, deraining and dehazing datasets. 
- Provides interpretable textual control over image restoration process.
- Introduces textual prompt based interaction for low-level vision tasks.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative text-guided model for blind image restoration that can accurately restore images based on user textual prompt while handling multiple arbitrary degradations robustly.
