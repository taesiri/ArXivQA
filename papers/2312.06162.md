 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TextPromptIR, an effective textual prompt guided image restoration model for blind image restoration. It introduces semantic prompts from users to help the model accurately recognize and remove different types of degradations within a unified framework, without increasing model complexity. The method has two stages - first, a task-specific BERT is fine-tuned to understand textual instructions and generate semantic prompts. Second, a backbone network with multi-level integrated transformer blocks leverages the textual prompts to bridge the gap between text and images, facilitating degradation identification and restoration. Depth-wise multi-head transposed attentions and gated convolutions are specifically designed to integrate textual and visual features. Experiments on image denoising, deraining and dehazing benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. TextPromptIR highlights the potential of providing a natural, precise and controllable way to perform image restoration via multimodal human-computer interaction. Key innovations include introducing textual prompts to low-level vision and effectively utilizing them to guide restoration.
