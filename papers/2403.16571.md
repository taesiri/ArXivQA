# [NSINA: A News Corpus for Sinhala](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper addresses the challenges of adapting large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages like Sinhala. The two main problems are: (1) lack of large-scale Sinhala text corpora to pretrain models, and (2) lack of benchmark datasets to evaluate model performance. 

To tackle these issues, the paper introduces NSina, a new large-scale news corpus for Sinhala with over 500,000 articles collected from 10 popular Sri Lankan news websites. The paper also proposes 3 Sinhala NLP tasks compiled from this corpus:

1. News media identification: Classify news article to its source media outlet
2. News category prediction: Categorize news article into domains like sports, business, etc.  
3. News headline generation: Generate news headline given article content

The key contributions are:

1. Release of NSina corpus - the largest published Sinhala news dataset so far at 1.87GB with 506,932 cleaned articles.

2. Compilation of 3 Sinhala NLP tasks with separate train/test splits sampled from NSina to benchmark language models.

3. Evaluation of several ML models like mBART, mT5, SinBERT on these tasks. mT5 performs the best on headline generation with BLEU score of 0.17. SinBERT gets best accuracy of ~0.89 on news source identification.

4. Public release of the corpus, benchmark tasks and model checkpoints to facilitate Sinhala NLP research.

The paper concludes that while multilingual models like mT5 and XLM-RoBERTa perform decently with availability of NSina, more research is required to build customized Sinhala LMs. The tasks introduced serve as useful benchmarks for such future work.
