# [What is different between these datasets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world applications often encounter dataset distribution shifts, where two comparable datasets have different underlying distributions. 
- It is important to understand the true nature and extent of these dataset differences to make informed decisions.
- Prior work has focused on detecting distribution shifts, but lacks methods to explain dataset differences in a human-understandable way.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an "explainable AI toolkit" to explain differences between any two datasets across modalities like tabular, text, image, audio etc.
- The toolkit provides detailed, interpretable, and actionable insights into how and why two datasets differ. 
- It includes three main algorithms:
   1) Influential example-based explanations using feature importances.
   2) Prototype-based explanations that find representative examples in datasets. 
   3) LLM-based explanations that compare natural language datasets in terms of human-interpretable attributes.

Key Contributions:
- Novel methods to generate prototype-based, influential example-based and LLM attribute-based explanations for dataset differences.
- Demonstrated the versatility of the toolkit across diverse data types and tasks.
- Showcased the actionability of the explanations to understand and mitigate dataset differences.
- Provided visual and quantitative analysis to highlight patterns in data using the explanations.
- Discussed failure modes and future work around evaluating dataset-level explanations.

In summary, the paper makes important strides in the emerging field of explaining differences between datasets by proposing versatile, human-centered techniques across modalities and demonstrating their utility.
