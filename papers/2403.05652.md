# [What is different between these datasets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world applications often encounter dataset distribution shifts, where two comparable datasets have different underlying distributions. 
- It is important to understand the true nature and extent of these dataset differences to make informed decisions.
- Prior work has focused on detecting distribution shifts, but lacks methods to explain dataset differences in a human-understandable way.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an "explainable AI toolkit" to explain differences between any two datasets across modalities like tabular, text, image, audio etc.
- The toolkit provides detailed, interpretable, and actionable insights into how and why two datasets differ. 
- It includes three main algorithms:
   1) Influential example-based explanations using feature importances.
   2) Prototype-based explanations that find representative examples in datasets. 
   3) LLM-based explanations that compare natural language datasets in terms of human-interpretable attributes.

Key Contributions:
- Novel methods to generate prototype-based, influential example-based and LLM attribute-based explanations for dataset differences.
- Demonstrated the versatility of the toolkit across diverse data types and tasks.
- Showcased the actionability of the explanations to understand and mitigate dataset differences.
- Provided visual and quantitative analysis to highlight patterns in data using the explanations.
- Discussed failure modes and future work around evaluating dataset-level explanations.

In summary, the paper makes important strides in the emerging field of explaining differences between datasets by proposing versatile, human-centered techniques across modalities and demonstrating their utility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a suite of interpretable methods to explain differences between two datasets across various data modalities, including techniques based on influential examples, prototypes, and attributes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a suite of interpretable methods (a toolbox) for explaining differences between two datasets across various data modalities like tabular data, images, text, and signals. The key methods introduced include:

1) Explanations based on influential examples that identify key data points responsible for differences in feature importances between the datasets. 

2) Prototype-based explanations that identify representative examples and prototypes in each dataset and quantify differences using metrics like neighboring sample proportion difference (NSPD) and neighboring sample distance difference (NSDD).

3) Explanations using large language models to compare natural language datasets based on human-interpretable linguistic attributes like emotion, tone, word choices etc. 

The paper demonstrates the versatility of these methods across several case studies and claims they can provide actionable and complementary insights to understand dataset differences effectively. A key differentiation from prior work seems to be the focus on human-understandable explanations rather than just detecting distribution shifts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and keywords related to this paper include:

- Dataset-level explanations - The paper focuses on explaining differences between datasets rather than explanations for individual predictions.

- Prototype explanations - One of the main methods proposed is using prototypical examples from each dataset to summarize and explain differences.

- Influential examples - Identifying and analyzing the most influential examples responsible for dataset differences. 

- Interpretable attributes - Using attributes of the data interpretable by humans to characterize and compare datasets.

- Distribution shift - The problem is related to detecting and analyzing distribution shifts between datasets.

- Actionable explanations - The goal is to provide explanations that can lead to concrete actions to mitigate dataset differences. 

- Multimodal data - The methods are evaluated on a variety of data types including tabular, text, image, audio and time series datasets.

- Faithfulness - Ensuring the explanations accurately reflect true differences between datasets.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with providing faithful, interpretable and actionable explanations specifically aimed at summarizing distribution shifts between datasets across different data modalities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using prototype-based explanations to understand differences between datasets. How does the choice of number of prototypes impact the complexity and faithfulness of the explanation? What would be good heuristics for choosing an appropriate number?

2. The paper introduces two metrics for quantitatively comparing datasets using prototypes - NSPD and NSDD. Under what conditions would one metric be more useful to analyze than the other? When would using both together provide additional insights?

3. Algorithm 1 computes influential examples between datasets using intrinsic feature importances and influence functions. What are some pros and cons of this approach compared to directly using statistical metrics like KL divergence to find distributional differences? 

4. For partial prototype explanations, the paper proposes a scoring function in Equation 2 that balances rank stability and value stability. How sensitive is the quality of the explanation to changes in the weighting coefficients c1, c2 and c3? What would be good rules of thumb for setting these coefficients?

5. Prototype-summarization based explanations seem very well suited for image data as shown in the MNIST example. What modifications might be needed to effectively apply this technique to other complex data types like audio or text?

6. The paper computes dataset-level attribution percentages using LLMs like GPT-3.5. What are some ways we could assess the trustworthiness of the LLM's responses? How can we prevent biased responses that affect the fidelity of the final explanation? 

7. The influential examples method requires being able to compute local feature importances for individual examples. For methods like permutation importance that only provide global importances, how can we adapt the influential examples technique?

8. What modifications would allow the prototype-based explanation methods to work for paired input-output datasets, like in machine translation or text summarization?

9. Beyond the techniques explored in this paper, what are some other potential ways to generate interpretable explanations for differences between datasets? What are relative pros and cons to explore?

10. The paper mentions the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for dataset-level explanations. What would be some desiderata for designing rigorous test suites to evaluate explanation methods fairly? What metrics seem most poised for validation?
