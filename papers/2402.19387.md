# [SeD: Semantic-Aware Discriminator for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19387)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing GAN-based image super-resolution (SR) methods use discriminators to enable the SR network (generator) to learn realistic texture distributions. However, the distribution learning is overly coarse-grained, making the textures susceptible to artifacts and counter-intuitive generation results. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a semantic-aware discriminator (SeD) that incorporates fine-grained image semantics as a condition to enable more realistic and natural texture generation. Specifically:

1) They extract semantics from a pretrained vision model (PVM), specifically the CLIP "RN50" model, which provides pixel-level semantics.

2) They design a semantic-aware fusion block (SeFB) that warps semantic-aware image features to the discriminator using a cross-attention mechanism between the semantics and image features. This better incorporates semantic guidance.

3) The semantic-conditioned discriminator can then distinguish real vs. fake textures more precisely based on semantic information, guiding the SR network to generate fine-grained, semantic-aware textures.

Main Contributions:

- First work to propose a semantic-aware discriminator for GAN-based SR that conditions on semantic information for finer texture generation.

- Design of the SeFB module to effectively incorporate semantic guidance into the discriminator via cross-attention.

- Demonstration of improved perceptual quality both quantitatively and qualitatively on classical and real-world SR datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- Modular design allowing SeD to work with different backbone generators and discriminators.

In summary, by conditioning texture generation on semantic information, the proposed semantic-aware discriminator enables significant improvements in perceptual realism and naturalness of textures for GAN-based super-resolution.
