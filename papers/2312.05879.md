# [Wild Motion Unleashed: Markerless 3D Kinematics and Force Estimation in   Cheetahs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05879)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Studying high-speed maneuverability of animals in the wild is extremely challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining complete whole-body motion and force data without constraining the animals.  
- The cheetah is an ideal model for studying quadruped dynamics given its unmatched speed and agility, but tracking collars used in previous studies only provide rigid body data, lacking information about leg, spine or tail kinematics/kinetics.

Proposed Solution
- The authors present a new markerless approach called kinetic full trajectory estimation (K-FTE) to estimate 3D kinematics and joint torques of cheetahs remotely using only video data. 
- It uses a physics-based model of the cheetah together with a trajectory optimization formulation to estimate dynamics that best fits the observed video.

Contributions
- Validated K-FTE method on a new dataset with synchronized video and force plates, showing good accuracy in reconstructing 3D poses (17.69 pixel reprojection error) and estimating ground reaction forces (RMS error 17.16% of peak).
- Applied approach on wild cheetah dataset AcinoSet to estimate joint torques. Results agree with torque profiles from previous invasive quadruped studies.
- First known markerless approach for full-body kinetic reconstruction of animals in the wild. Can provide new biomechanics insights without requiring markers or trackers on animals.

In summary, the key innovation is a new optimization-based method to estimate 3D motion and dynamics of animals remotely using only multi-view video data. It was validated on cheetahs and can enable new studies of agile maneuvers in wildlife. The approach could be useful for both biologists studying natural animal behaviors as well as roboticists aiming to match animal agility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a trajectory optimization approach called kinetic full trajectory estimation (K-FTE) to estimate 3D kinematics and joint torques of cheetahs from videos, validated on a new dataset with synchronized video and force plate data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of a method called kinetic full trajectory estimation (K-FTE) to estimate 3D kinematics and joint torques of cheetahs from multi-view video data. Specifically:

- They formulate a trajectory optimization problem that incorporates a physics-based model to estimate joint torques and ground reaction forces in addition to the 3D poses. This goes beyond previous animal pose estimation methods that focused only on kinematics. 

- They validate the method on a new dataset of cheetah locomotion containing synchronized video and force plate data. The estimated ground reaction forces agree reasonably well with the force plate measurements.

- They apply the approach on a dataset of freely running cheetahs to estimate joint torques during locomotion. While the torques cannot be directly validated, they agree with trends found in previous invasive studies on quadrupeds.

- This enables new possibilities for studying animal biomechanics using non-invasive vision-based methods. It can provide useful data on joint loading and dynamics to biologists and roboticists.

In summary, the key contribution is the development and validation of a new markerless method to estimate 3D dynamics (kinetics and kinematics) of animals like cheetahs from multi-view video. This could enable new research directions in understanding wildlife locomotion.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main keywords or key terms associated with it are:

- pose estimation

- cheetahs
- markerless 
- multi-camera system
- kinetic full trajectory estimation (K-FTE)

- friction cone constraints

The paper presents a method called "kinetic full trajectory estimation" (K-FTE) to estimate 3D poses, joint torques, and ground reaction forces of cheetahs from multi-camera videos, without using markers on the animals. Key aspects include formulating it as a trajectory optimization problem with dynamics and contact constraints, using a rigid body model of the cheetah, and validating the estimated forces against force plate data. So the main focus is on analyzing the dynamics and kinetics of cheetah locomotion using vision-based estimation approaches.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that the proposed K-FTE method can estimate 3D kinematics and joint torques. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of using an optimization-based approach compared to using a learning-based method for this task?

2. One part of the cost function aims to minimize accelerations of the 3D markers (equation 12). Why is this important? How sensitive are the final results to the relative weighting of this term? 

3. In the trajectory optimization formulation, both joint torques and ground reaction forces are decision variables. What is the main challenge in estimating these quantities simultaneously and how does the paper attempt to address it?

4. The paper validates ground reaction forces indirectly using force plate data. What are some limitations of this validation approach? How could the validation be improved with additional instrumentation?

5. The rigid body model used for the cheetah has limitations in capturing certain poses (Figure 6). How could the model be improved to better represent the flexibility and dynamics of the cheetah skeleton and muscles?

6. The paper assumes known contact timings. How would performance degrade if contact timings need to be estimated as well? What methods could be used to estimate contact timings?

7. For the sinusoidal GRF method, how was the amplitude of the vertical GRF component determined? How sensitive are the final torque estimates to this choice of amplitude?

8. The paper mentions that the proposed method could be applied to other animals. What modifications would likely be required to apply it to animals with significantly different morphology like quadrupeds, bipeds, birds etc?

9. Could the trajectory optimization framework incorporate learned priors on dynamics quantities like GRFs and torques? If so, how may this improve results compared to hand-designed priors?

10. The paper aims to estimate torques to gain insight into cheetah dynamics. What other analyses could be enabled by having access to estimated full body dynamics like this?
