# [Wild Motion Unleashed: Markerless 3D Kinematics and Force Estimation in   Cheetahs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05879)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Studying high-speed maneuverability of animals in the wild is extremely challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining complete whole-body motion and force data without constraining the animals.  
- The cheetah is an ideal model for studying quadruped dynamics given its unmatched speed and agility, but tracking collars used in previous studies only provide rigid body data, lacking information about leg, spine or tail kinematics/kinetics.

Proposed Solution
- The authors present a new markerless approach called kinetic full trajectory estimation (K-FTE) to estimate 3D kinematics and joint torques of cheetahs remotely using only video data. 
- It uses a physics-based model of the cheetah together with a trajectory optimization formulation to estimate dynamics that best fits the observed video.

Contributions
- Validated K-FTE method on a new dataset with synchronized video and force plates, showing good accuracy in reconstructing 3D poses (17.69 pixel reprojection error) and estimating ground reaction forces (RMS error 17.16% of peak).
- Applied approach on wild cheetah dataset AcinoSet to estimate joint torques. Results agree with torque profiles from previous invasive quadruped studies.
- First known markerless approach for full-body kinetic reconstruction of animals in the wild. Can provide new biomechanics insights without requiring markers or trackers on animals.

In summary, the key innovation is a new optimization-based method to estimate 3D motion and dynamics of animals remotely using only multi-view video data. It was validated on cheetahs and can enable new studies of agile maneuvers in wildlife. The approach could be useful for both biologists studying natural animal behaviors as well as roboticists aiming to match animal agility.
