# [How do Large Language Models Navigate Conflicts between Honesty and   Helpfulness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Honesty and helpfulness are two key desiderata for conversational agents. However, in everyday conversation these values can come into tension - people often approximate the truth or omit details in order to be more helpful to the listener. This paper studies how large language models (LLMs) handle such nuanced trade-offs between honesty and helpfulness. Specifically, it aims to analyze the conversational values internalized by LLMs and explore whether these values can be steered via prompting.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors formalize honesty using the Gricean maxim of quality and helpfulness using decision-theoretic notions from the cognitive science literature. They introduce the signaling bandits experimental paradigm which allows measuring and trading off honesty and helpfulness in a controlled setup. The authors test a range of LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, LLaMA, Mixtral) in signaling bandits experiments and model their utterance choices to quantify the tradeoffs. They also test the effects of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

Key Contributions:
- RLHF improves both honesty and helpfulness of models, while CoT increases helpfulness but can reduce honesty
- Model analysis reveals variability in adherence to human conversational norms and steerability across models  
- GPT-4 Turbo displays human-like sensitivity to conversational framing and listener context when trading off values
- With CoT prompting, GPT-4 Turbo can be steered towards honesty or helpfulness, much like humans
- In realistic settings, models prioritize honesty but are still steerable via prompts encouraging helpfulness

In summary, the paper provides a framework to analyze how abstract conversational values manifest in LLMs, paving the way for understanding and steering towards more human-like behavior. The latest GPT-4 Turbo model displays remarkable similarity to human conversational norms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes using experimental paradigms from cognitive psychology that put helpfulness and honesty in tension to analyze how large language models handle trade-offs between these values, finding that reinforcement learning and prompting can improve alignment but models still differ from humans.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes a framework to test how large language models (LLMs) handle trade-offs between honesty and helpfulness in ambiguous conversational settings. Specifically, it:

1) Formally models the concepts of honesty and helpfulness based on theories from cognitive science and the Gricean maxims. 

2) Introduces the signaling bandits experimental paradigm to quantitatively measure honesty and helpfulness, and explore how models trade off between these values.

3) Conducts experiments on a range of LLMs to analyze the effects of model training (RLHF), prompting (chain-of-thought), and problem settings (abstract vs realistic) on the honesty-helpfulness trade-off.

4) Finds that RLHF improves both values, while chain-of-thought improves helpfulness at the cost of honesty. The latest models (GPT-4 Turbo) display human-like sensitivity to conversational framing and can be steered towards different trade-offs through prompting.

In summary, the main contribution is a framework and experimental methodology to analyze the implicit conversational values in LLMs regarding honesty and helpfulness, how these values manifest and can be steered.

The paper examines how large language models navigate trade-offs between being honest and helpful in conversational settings. It grounds the concepts of honesty and helpfulness in Gricean maxims from cognitive science. The paper then uses experimental paradigms from psychology involving "signaling bandits" to analyze a range of LLMs and how factors like RLHF and chain-of-thought prompting impact the trade-off between honesty and helpfulness. The goal is to uncover the conversational values learned by LLMs and whether they can be steered towards better alignment with human values.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using signaling bandits, a variant of Lewis signaling games, to measure the trade-off between honesty and helpfulness in large language models. Could you explain in more detail how this experimental paradigm allows you to quantify and manipulate these abstract values? 

2. The paper argues that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) trains models more directly towards human values and preferences. What evidence does the paper provide that RLHF improves both honesty and helpfulness in language models? Are there any downsides or limitations to this approach?

3. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is found to increase helpfulness but reduce honesty in several models tested. What might explain this bias induced by CoT towards prioritizing helpfulness over truthfulness? Are there ways this effect could be mitigated?

4. The paper shows interesting differences between models in how they trade off honesty and helpfulness. For example, post-RLHF Mixtral strongly favors honesty while pre-RLHF favors helpfulness. What might account for these qualitative differences between models?

5. The steerability experiments show that only GPT-4 Turbo responds appropriately to prompts encouraging honesty versus helpfulness. Why might more advanced models like GPT-4 Turbo display greater sensitivity to conversational framing in this way?

6. The paper argues that abstraction of the experimental domain (mushroom game) causes models to over-value helpfulness compared to more realistic domains (housing, dining). Why might realism influence how models navigate this trade-off?  

7. The formalization of helpfulness in the paper is based on decision-theoretic utility and the listener's subsequent actions. Could you explain this definition and how it relates to relevance in human communication?

8. What are some other human values and trade-offs, beyond honesty and helpfulness, that would be important to measure in future work with this kind of experimental paradigm?

9. One limitation acknowledged is that controlled experimental stimuli may not generalize to real-world language use. How might the concepts explored in this paper be tested or applied in more open-ended conversational settings?

10. The paper emphasizes comparisons to human conversational norms and principles. Could you discuss some of the challenges and ethical considerations around comparing language model behaviors directly to humans?
