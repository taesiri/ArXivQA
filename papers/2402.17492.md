# [syren-halofit: A fast, interpretable, high-precision formula for the   $Λ$CDM nonlinear matter power spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17492)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Rapid and accurate evaluation of the nonlinear matter power spectrum $P(k)$ as a function of cosmological parameters and redshift is important in cosmology. Analytic approximations provide an interpretable solution, yet current approximations are neither fast nor accurate compared to black-box numerical emulators. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors accelerate symbolic approximations to $P(k)$ by:

1) Removing the requirement to perform integrals to compute variables like $k_\sigma$, instead using short symbolic expressions to directly compute all variables needed by the Halofit model. This dramatically increases speed.

2) Re-optimising Halofit parameters on a wider range of relevant cosmologies and redshifts, reducing errors from ∼10% to ∼5% for $k≲ 10 h$ Mpc$^{−1}$. 

3) Providing a short symbolic correction to Halofit that further reduces errors to ∼1%, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art numerical emulators.

Main Contributions:

- Simple analytic expressions for $k_\sigma$, $n_{\rm eff}$ and $C$ needed by Halofit, with <1% accuracy across cosmologies and redshifts up to $z=3$  

- Re-optimised Halofit parameters valid for a wider range of cosmological parameters, reducing maximum errors from 10% to 5%

- Introduction of SRHalofit - an extension to Halofit with a concise symbolic correction that reduces errors to ∼1%

- SRHalofit is >2000 times faster than Halofit implementations in CAMB and HMCODE and 2680 times faster than the EuclidEmulator2

- Comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art numerical emulators while being significantly faster and more interpretable

The work greatly increases speed and accuracy of symbolic $P(k)$ approximations, making them faster than numerical emulators without loss of accuracy.
