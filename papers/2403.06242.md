## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manual examination of medical images for COVID-19 diagnosis is time-consuming for physicians. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can help automate and improve this process.
- Existing CAD systems have limitations in reliability, scalability, and explainability. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a CAD system for COVID-19 diagnosis from 3D CT scans using a deep learning model called RACNet.
- Enhance RACNet with an anchor set to improve explainability of diagnoses. 
- Deploy the system using a microservices architecture spanning cloud and edge devices to ensure reliability, scalability, data privacy and security.

Key Contributions:
- RACNet model that analyzes entire 3D CT scans and provides COVID-19 diagnosis with state-of-the-art accuracy.
- Anchor set method that selects similar cases from training data to explain diagnoses. 
- Novel system architecture using microservices and both cloud and edge execution to enable scalable and secure deployment.
- End-to-end application from uploading scans to receiving diagnosis reports with visual explanations.
- Complies with ethics standards regarding use of medical data.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end CAD system for fast and reliable COVID-19 detection from 3D CT scans. The system uses advanced deep learning while ensuring explainability, security and scalability through its unique architecture design. It demonstrates a promising solution to assist physicians in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:
