# [Towards Few-Shot Adaptation of Foundation Models via Multitask   Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15017)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Foundation models like BERT and CLIP have shown tremendous success on many AI tasks. However, effectively adapting them to new tasks, especially those with limited labeled data, remains challenging and lacks theoretical understanding.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper studies an emerging solution called "multitask finetuning" which first finetunes a foundation model on multiple auxiliary tasks before adapting it to the target task. 
- It provides a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of multitask finetuning. The key insight is that with sufficient diversity and consistency between the finetuning tasks and target task, multitask finetuning can reduce errors on the target task.

Main Contributions:
- Develops a theoretical framework based on notions of diversity and consistency to explain when multitask finetuning helps for adapting foundation models. Provides sample complexity results.
- Conducts extensive experiments on vision and NLP tasks to verify the theory. Shows multitask finetuning consistently outperforms baselines.
- Proposes a practical task selection algorithm for choosing suitable finetuning tasks based on the theoretical insight. Demonstrates improved accuracy compared to using all possible tasks.

In summary, the paper provides theoretical justification and extensive empirical evidence for multitask finetuning as an effective approach for adapting foundation models to new tasks with limited labeled data. The analysis of diversity and consistency sheds new light on this problem.
