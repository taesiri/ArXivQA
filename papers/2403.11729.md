# [Hardware Design and Learning-Based Software Architecture of   Musculoskeletal Wheeled Robot Musashi-W for Real-World Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11729)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Musculoskeletal humanoids have flexible, redundant bodies that mimic humans, but are difficult to control and have not succeeded at bipedal walking or real-world applications.

Proposed Solution:  
- Develop a musculoskeletal wheeled robot called Musashi-W that combines musculoskeletal dual arms with a mechanum-wheeled base and linear motion mechanism for stability.

Hardware Design:
- Musculoskeletal dual arms have biomimetic features like flexible hands, redundant muscles, variable stiffness. Easy to rearrange/add muscles.
- Wheeled base with linear motion allows stable movement to utilize arms.

Software Architecture: 
- Uses static and dynamic body schema learning to control complex musculoskeletal body.
- Static learning controls basic motions, dynamic handles tools/objects.
- Reflex controls prevent muscle tension increase and regulate motor temperatures.
- Integrates classical controls like vision, planning, wheel control.

Key Contributions:
- Hardware platform combining flexible musculoskeletal arms and wheeled stability for real-world use.
- Learning-based software system to control complex musculoskeletal body.  
- Demonstrated feasibility through cleaning with human teaching, heavy object carrying with muscle addition, and table setting with dynamic cloth manipulation.

The key insight is that by combining the benefits of musculoskeletal arms with the stability of wheels, real-world applications become more feasible. The learning-based control software is essential to handle the complexity and redundancy. The results show promising capability on practical tasks by exploiting bio-inspired properties.
