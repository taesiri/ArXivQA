## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief comparison of this paper to other research in the field:- Scope: This paper presents a large-scale, standardized evaluation of diverse capabilities across a wide range of language models. The scope is very ambitious compared to most prior work, which tends to focus evaluation on a narrow set of models, tasks, or metrics.- Models Evaluated: The paper evaluates 30 major language models, spanning the largest models from a diverse set of tech companies, academic institutions, and independent researchers. Most prior evaluations focus on 1-3 models. - Tasks and Scenarios: The evaluation covers over 40 diverse scenarios, ranging from standard NLP datasets to targeted evaluations of reasoning, knowledge, and harms. Many prior evaluations focus on a small set (<10) of representative tasks.- Metrics: The paper examines models through 7 categories of metrics including accuracy, uncertainty, robustness, efficiency, fairness, bias, and toxicity. Most work focuses primarily on accuracy metrics. - Analysis: The analysis identifies key trends and abilities/limitations across different models based on model scale, family, and training data. Many papers present results on individual datasets without this high-level synthesis.- Resources: The paper open sources the full benchmark to enable future standardized evaluations. Most prior work does not release code or model predictions.In summary, the scope and rigor of this evaluation significantly raises the bar for language model benchmarking compared to prior work. The paper's comprehensive analysis provides novel insights about current foundation models. The open-sourced resources will empower more robust evaluations in the future.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- This paper introduces a new holistic framework and benchmark for evaluating language models called HELM. Other major benchmarking efforts like SuperGLUE, BIG-Bench, and the LM Evaluation Harness have focused on evaluating models on specific capabilities using existing datasets. HELM is more comprehensive and systematic in its evaluation across different facets like accuracy, robustness, harms, reasoning, etc. - The coverage of models, tasks, and evaluation metrics in HELM is significantly broader compared to prior work. HELM evaluates 30 major language models across 42 scenarios spanning different capabilities. Other benchmarking papers have evaluated fewer models (typically just 1-2) on fewer tasks. HELM also introduces several new scenarios and evaluation metrics.- A key contribution is the taxonomy of metrics going beyond just accuracy. Most prior benchmarking efforts focused heavily on accuracy/perplexity metrics. HELM also measures many other attributes like calibration, efficiency, fairness, etc. This provides a more multidimensional view of model capabilities.- The benchmark rigorously measures few-shot prompting performance. Many benchmarks test models already fine-tuned on the evaluation data. HELM measures raw few-shot ability through careful prompt engineering.- HELM focuses on systematic and standardized comparison of many existing models. Other works like PaLM and Chinchilla introduced new state-of-the-art models and compared against a few baselines. HELM does not introduce new models but comprehensively compares existing ones.- The benchmark interface and framework is designed for extensibility and community contribution. Other benchmarking papers present more static one-time evaluations. HELM is built to grow over time.In summary, HELM pushes forward the rigorous evaluation of language models in terms of scale, diversity, and standardization compared to prior benchmarking efforts. It provides a more comprehensive view of existing models while also supporting ongoing community-driven development.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing better protocols for specifying priorities and determining ideal evaluations given limited resources. The authors note that properly determining priorities for benchmark scenarios is challenging and subjective. They suggest future work could develop better systems for specifying priorities and reasoning about how to select benchmark scenarios given a fixed budget or other constraints.- Exploring how users naturally prompt language models in different settings. The authors argue for viewing prompting as user behavior and having models work well on naturalistic prompts. They suggest future work could study how users actually prompt models across diverse interfaces and applications.- Creating standardized prompts to make models interoperable. Relatedly, the authors propose future work could explore developing standardized prompts so different language models respond similarly, improving interoperability. - Incorporating more diverse voices into benchmark design. The authors acknowledge benchmarks embed values and their effort comes from a privileged institution, arguing for community-driven benchmark design and adoption.- Developing better training contamination documentation. The authors encourage model providers to share details on training data and contamination to assess benchmark validity.- Expanding the benchmark's coverage. The authors invite the community to contribute additional scenarios, metrics, and models to the benchmark to better reflect diverse needs.In summary, key directions center on improving benchmark design, prompting, and transparency around training data and procedures. The authors advocate for more participatory, standardized, and well-documented benchmark development sensitive to the broader AI community's values and priorities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other methods for prioritizing evaluation scenarios, beyond their proposed priority system. They suggest community-driven approaches and formal methods like framing it as a knapsack problem.- Developing better protocols for specifying priorities and determining the ideal evaluation given fixed resources. This could help advance the idea of adaptive benchmarking.- Exploring how real users prompt language models in different settings, to better reflect naturalistic usage in benchmark prompts.- Enabling model interoperability, so different models work well on similar user prompts. - Improving methods for few-shot learning and reducing the brittleness of prompting approaches.- Expanding the benchmark with additional challenging scenarios, especially in areas like reasoning and social implications.- Incorporating more languages beyond English.- Developing better protocols for tracking and mitigating train-test contamination.- Expanding analysis of model performance across different demographic groups and fairness considerations.- Conducting human evaluations to complement automated metrics.- Comparing models deployed in real-world vs controlled settings.- Long-term tracking of model capabilities over time as models evolve.In summary, they highlight directions like expanding the scope of evaluation, improving prompting approaches, mitigating contamination, advancing fairness, complementing automated metrics with human evaluation, and long-term tracking of progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of a large set of language models on a diverse range of tasks. The authors introduce a modular evaluation framework called HELM that allows testing language models on core language tasks as well as targeted components like reasoning, knowledge, and harms. The framework contains over 40 scenarios adapted for few-shot learning and a taxonomy of metrics for analysis. Using this framework, 30 language models spanning model families from research labs and companies are evaluated. The analysis reveals several key findings around performance, calibration, robustness, efficiency, fairness and harms. Models generally perform well on core language tasks but struggle on more complex reasoning. Performance metrics alone are insufficient and calibration is often poor on tasks. Robustness varies greatly across models and tasks for small perturbations. Large models are very computationally inefficient. Fairness audits reveal issues in some models, as do tests for bias and toxicity. Overall, the analysis provides one of the most comprehensive pictures of foundation model capabilities to date and highlights many promising future research directions.
