# [Safe Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07281)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel safe Bayesian optimization algorithm for efficiently optimizing systems by incorporating multiple information sources, including simulations and surrogate models, while providing robust theoretical safety guarantees. The key idea is to extend existing error bounds for Gaussian processes to the multi-task setting by considering the uncertainty in the correlation structure between tasks. This is achieved by modeling the correlation matrix as a hyperparameter with a prior distribution and using Monte Carlo sampling to obtain robust bounds that hold with high probability. The proposed SaMSBO algorithm allows accelerated optimization by supplementing expensive evaluations of the actual system with cheaper simulations, while ensuring safety by propagating uncertainty to the error bounds. The method is demonstrated through application to a laser synchronization system, significantly outperforming standard Bayesian optimization techniques. Theoretical analysis and simulations verify SaMSBO as the first provably safe multi-task Bayesian optimizer, with substantial promise for accelerating safe optimization of complex real-world systems.
