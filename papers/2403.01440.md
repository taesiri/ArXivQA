## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Monocular depth estimation (MDE) aims to predict a dense depth map from a single RGB image. It is an ill-posed problem since a single image can be projected from infinite 3D scenes. Prior works in MDE using deep networks do not consider the different contributions of high-level contextual features versus low-level spatial features for depth prediction. This leads to inaccurate spatial layout, ambiguous object boundaries and discontinuous surfaces in the predicted depth maps.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Pyramid Feature Attention Network (PFANet) that improves both high-level context features and low-level spatial features for better MDE. The key components are:

1) A Dual-scale Channel Attention Module (DCAM) that applies channel attention at global and local scales on high-level features to aggregate both global context and local information useful for depth prediction. 

2) A Spatial Pyramid Attention Module (SPAM) that guides the network to focus on multi-scale spatial details in low-level features, enhancing local texture and structure awareness.

3) A scale-invariant gradient loss term that sharpens object boundaries and smooths homogeneous regions in the predicted depth.

Main Contributions:

1) A network architecture combining channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms to selectively aggregate useful global and local information from both high-level and low-level CNN features for improved MDE.

2) Introduction of a gradient loss to enforce depth discontinuities at object boundaries and spatial smoothness of surfaces.

3) State-of-the-art performance on the challenging KITTI benchmark dataset, with improved accuracy of spatial layout, object boundaries and surface continuity compared to prior works.

The proposed PFANet effectively combines global context, local details, and structural awareness within a pyramidal feature attention framework to advance the state-of-the-art in monocular depth prediction.
