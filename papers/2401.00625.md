## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Beyond Efficiency: A Systematic Survey of Resource-Efficient Large Language Models":

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have achieved major advancements in AI capabilities. However, their exponential growth in size and complexity also brings substantial challenges in terms of high consumption of computational, memory, energy, and financial resources. This is problematic, especially in resource-constrained environments like academic labs that lack the vast infrastructure of big tech companies. Additionally, the heavy carbon footprint due to extensive GPU usage for training raises environmental concerns. There is a need for focused efforts to enhance the resource efficiency of LLMs across metrics like computation, memory, energy, cost, etc.

Proposed Solution:  
This paper offers a systematic survey of techniques for improving the resource efficiency of LLMs, categorized across the entire LLM lifecycle - architecture design, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference, and system design. It introduces a taxonomy of key resources involved including computation, memory, energy, money, and network communication. The survey comprehensively reviews methods aimed at optimizing each of these resources at different stages of the LLM pipeline, highlighting innovations in areas like efficient transformer architectures, distributed training, dynamic inference using early exit, knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation etc. 

Main Contributions:
1) Comprehensive overview of resource-efficient LLM techniques across the model's entire lifecycle
2) Systematic taxonomy and categorization of techniques based on the specific resource(s) they optimize 
3) Standardized benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics tailored for resource efficiency
4) Identification of current gaps and future research directions in developing accessible and sustainable LLMs

The survey serves as a structured framework that aids researchers/practitioners in navigating the landscape of resource optimization for LLMs. By reviewing the state-of-the-art and pointing to open problems, it aims to catalyze more research towards efficient and environmentally-responsible LLMs.
