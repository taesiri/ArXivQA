# [Motion Blur Decomposition with Cross-shutter Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01120)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Motion blur is a common image artifact caused by camera or object motion during image exposure. Simply removing the blur can lose detail, so recent work tries to decompose the blurry image into a sharp image sequence.
- However, motion blur decomposition is highly ill-posed due to motion ambiguity - many different motion sequences can explain the same blur. Additional information is needed to disambiguate the motion.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using a rolling shutter (RS) camera in addition to the normal global shutter (GS) blurry camera. The row-by-row exposure of RS provides some motion information that can help guide GS blur decomposition.
- A triaxial capture system with GS, RS and high-speed cameras is built to collect aligned blurry, rolling shutter and ground truth data. 
- A deep network is proposed with two main stages - motion interpretation and blur decomposition. It has bilateral branches to process GS and RS inputs, with shutter alignment modules to mutually enhance each branch.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new dual GS-RS camera setup for motion blur decomposition which is shown to be better than using GS inputs alone.
- Develops a real triaxial capture system and dataset of aligned GS blur, RS and high frame rate ground truth videos.
- Designs a network with bilateral branches and shutter alignment to utilize complementary GS and RS observations for video reconstruction from blur.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach over other methods.

In summary, the key idea is that the row-wise exposure of RS cameras provides some motion cues that can help disambiguate the severer motion ambiguity in GS blur, so using both observation together improves video reconstruction from blur. The dual camera setup, real dataset and network design effectively realize this idea.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel cross-shutter setting using both global shutter and rolling shutter cameras to address the motion ambiguity in decomposing a single motion blurred image into a sharp image sequence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a new setting of using a dual blurry global shutter (GS) and rolling shutter (RS) camera system to address the motion ambiguity issues in blur decomposition of a single blurry image. 

2) It develops a triaxial imaging system to collect aligned blurry GS-RS image pairs along with high-speed sharp ground truth images. Using this system, the authors collect a real-world dataset named RealBR.

3) It introduces a novel two-staged neural network architecture containing motion interpretation and blur decomposition modules. The key aspects are: dual streams with mutual incentive to handle the contextual and temporal information from the GS and RS views; temporal positional encoding to disambiguate motion directions; and a shutter alignment module to propagate useful features across the two streams.

4) Through experiments on RealBR and synthetic datasets, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed dual GS-RS setting and network architecture for blur decomposition. It also shows the advantages of this approach over using just GS or RS images and over existing state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a dual GS-RS camera setup along with a tailored network architecture to effectively perform motion decomposition on blurry images.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Motion blur decomposition - The main focus of the paper is decomposing a single blurry image into a sequence of sharp latent frames.

- Rolling shutter (RS) camera - The paper proposes using a rolling shutter camera in combination with a global shutter (GS) camera to help address the ambiguity in motion blur decomposition.

- Dual camera system - The paper develops a triaxial imaging system with a GS camera, RS camera, and high-speed camera to capture aligned blurry, rolling shutter, and sharp ground truth images. 

- Temporal ordering - A key challenge in motion blur decomposition is the loss of temporal ordering of latent frames, which the proposed RS camera helps address.

- Contextual characterization - One branch of the proposed network focuses on extracting contextual information from the blurry input.  

- Temporal abstraction - The other branch of the proposed network focuses on temporally abstracting information from the RS input.

- Mutual incentive - The two network branches promote interaction through predicted bidirectional displacement fields.

- RealBR dataset - The paper collects and constructs a new real-world dataset of aligned blurry, rolling shutter, and sharp frames.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a dual Blur-RS imaging system to address the motion ambiguity in blur decomposition. Can you elaborate on why capturing both blurry and rolling shutter images helps resolve this ambiguity compared to using just blurry images?

2) The motion interpretation module contains dual streams with mutual incentive through the shutter alignment and aggregation (SAA) module. Can you explain the motivation and working of the SAA module? How exactly does it help propagate useful information across the two streams?

3) The paper argues that the rolling shutter stream helps disambiguate motion directions while the blur stream provides motion magnitudes and handles initial state ambiguity. Can you discuss this claim in more detail and provide some examples to illustrate it? 

4) Temporal positional encoding is used only in the rolling shutter stream in the motion interpretation module. What is the intuition behind using temporal encoding in just one stream? Does adding it to the blur stream provide any benefits?

5) Can you analyze the complexity added by using two image streams compared to single stream methods? Does the performance gain justify the added complexity in your opinion?

6) The method is evaluated on both real and synthetic datasets. What are some key differences in performance on the two datasets? What might be the reasons behind those differences?

7) How does the performance vary as the number of output frames is increased? When does the performance start degrading significantly and why?

8) The paper studies the impact of misaligned input views. How robust is the method to such misalignment? At what level of misalignment do you see a noticeable drop in performance?

9) For real-world deployment, what changes would you suggest to the imaging system to make it more feasible and compact without compromising the performance significantly?

10) The proposed dual Blur-RS approach is compared to other dual view systems like dual RS, RS-Event, etc. Can you analyze the relative advantages and disadvantages of these different systems? When might one be preferred over the others?
