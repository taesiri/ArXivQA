# [Learning to Schedule Online Tasks with Bandit Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of online task scheduling, where tasks arrive sequentially in a system and need to be assigned available resources in real-time. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward-to-cost ratio over the sequence of tasks. There are two key challenges:

1) Rewards and costs are unknown a priori and only revealed as bandit feedback after making a scheduling decision. 

2) The task arrival distribution is uncertain and unknown beforehand. Prior assumptions on the distribution can fail in practice due to unpredictable fluctuations.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel algorithm called DOL-RM that addresses the two challenges. It has two main components:

1) A double-optimistic learning (DOL) module that provides optimistic estimates of the unknown rewards and costs using upper and lower confidence bounds. This encourages exploration.

2) A Robbins-Monro (RM) based decision module that implicitly learns the task arrival distribution while making scheduling decisions. It frames the problem as a stochastic root-finding problem and iteratively updates the estimate of the optimal reward-to-cost ratio.

Together, DOL-RM effectively handles the uncertainties in rewards, costs and task arrivals to maximize cumulative system efficiency over time.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates a general model for online task scheduling under uncertainties.

- Develops a novel DOL-RM algorithm that integrates optimistic learning and Robbins-Monro method to address key challenges. 

- Provides theoretical analysis showing DOL-RM achieves sub-linear regret of O(T^{3/4}), the first such result for this setting.

- Validates DOL-RM's superior empirical performance over baselines on both synthetic and real-world experiments on cloud scheduling.

The paper makes a notable contribution in enabling effective online scheduling without any prior system knowledge, with both theoretical and practical advances.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel algorithm called DOL-RM that integrates double-optimistic learning and a modified Robbins-Monro method to effectively schedule online tasks and maximize the reward-to-cost ratio without requiring any prior knowledge about rewards, costs, or task arrival distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A general framework for online task scheduling without any prior knowledge of reward, cost and task arrival distribution. This framework encapsulates many practical instances whose goal is to optimize the reward-to-cost ratio.

2. A novel algorithm called DOL-RM that incorporates double-optimistic learning for unknown rewards and costs and a modified Robbins-Monro method to implicitly learn the uncertain task arrival distribution.

3. Theoretical analysis showing that DOL-RM achieves a sub-linear regret of O(T^{3/4}), which is the first result for online task scheduling under uncertain task arrival distribution and unknown reward and cost.

4. Evaluations on both synthetic simulation and a real-world machine learning task scheduling experiment demonstrating that DOL-RM can achieve the best cumulative reward-to-cost ratio without any prior knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective framework, algorithm, analysis and applications for online task scheduling without assuming any prior knowledge of rewards, costs and task arrivals. The key innovation lies in the integrated design of double-optimistic learning and Robbins-Monro method to address the challenges induced by various uncertainties.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a double-optimistic learning approach to estimate the reward and cost functions. Can you explain in more detail how the optimistic estimations for the rewards and costs are obtained? What is the intuition behind taking an optimistic view?

2. The Robbins-Monro method is utilized to make scheduling decisions by implicitly learning the task arrival distribution. Can you explain the key idea behind this method and why it allows circumventing the need to directly estimate the task arrival distribution? 

3. The paper proves a sub-linear regret bound of O(T^{3/4}) for the proposed DOL-RM algorithm. Can you walk through the key steps in the regret analysis? What are the main challenges in analyzing the regret and how does the paper address them?

4. How does the paper decompose the convergence gap to facilitate the analysis? What bounds are established for the two components related to double-optimistic learning and the Robbins-Monro method?

5. The Lyapunov drift analysis plays a critical role in controlling the cumulative errors. Can you explain the key ideas behind this technique and how it is applied in the paper to analyze the cumulative error term? 

6. How does the paper address the two main challenges of unknown rewards/costs and uncertain task arrival distributions? What modifications or extensions would be needed to apply the method in other problem settings?

7. What practical insights does the algorithm design provide? How could the techniques proposed be useful for real-world scheduling systems?

8. The paper assumes rewards and costs are independent if the task type and decision are the same. How could dependencies between these variables impact the performance of DOL-RM?

9. What differences exist between the problem studied here and other related models like cost-aware bandits? What extensions would help better connect these models?

10. The experiments consider both synthetic and real-world (ML training task) datasets. What other experiments could provide further insights into the practical performance of DOL-RM? Are there other real-world applications where it could be beneficial?
