# [Learning to Schedule Online Tasks with Bandit Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of online task scheduling, where tasks arrive sequentially in a system and need to be assigned available resources in real-time. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward-to-cost ratio over the sequence of tasks. There are two key challenges:

1) Rewards and costs are unknown a priori and only revealed as bandit feedback after making a scheduling decision. 

2) The task arrival distribution is uncertain and unknown beforehand. Prior assumptions on the distribution can fail in practice due to unpredictable fluctuations.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel algorithm called DOL-RM that addresses the two challenges. It has two main components:

1) A double-optimistic learning (DOL) module that provides optimistic estimates of the unknown rewards and costs using upper and lower confidence bounds. This encourages exploration.

2) A Robbins-Monro (RM) based decision module that implicitly learns the task arrival distribution while making scheduling decisions. It frames the problem as a stochastic root-finding problem and iteratively updates the estimate of the optimal reward-to-cost ratio.

Together, DOL-RM effectively handles the uncertainties in rewards, costs and task arrivals to maximize cumulative system efficiency over time.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates a general model for online task scheduling under uncertainties.

- Develops a novel DOL-RM algorithm that integrates optimistic learning and Robbins-Monro method to address key challenges. 

- Provides theoretical analysis showing DOL-RM achieves sub-linear regret of O(T^{3/4}), the first such result for this setting.

- Validates DOL-RM's superior empirical performance over baselines on both synthetic and real-world experiments on cloud scheduling.

The paper makes a notable contribution in enabling effective online scheduling without any prior system knowledge, with both theoretical and practical advances.
