# [Legged Robot State Estimation With Invariant Extended Kalman Filter   Using Neural Measurement Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate state estimation is crucial for model predictive control and learning-based control of legged robots. Proprioceptive sensor-based estimators using only encoders and IMUs are a lightweight and efficient solution, but they struggle with accuracy due to unmodeled effects like foot slippage. Prior works have tried model-based filters and learning-based methods, but both have limitations. Model-based methods make simplifying assumptions about contact conditions. Learning-based methods require extensive real-world data collection which is difficult and expensive.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel proprioceptive state estimator that combines a Neural Measurement Network (NMN) with an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF). The NMN uses only simulation data to predict contact probability and body linear velocity from proprioceptive data. These predictions are integrated as extra measurements in the IEKF to improve accuracy and adaptability. To address the sim-to-real gap, the paper analyzes different regularization techniques like smoothness loss and early stopping.

Contributions:

- A state estimation framework integrating NMN predictions with IEKF for improved accuracy using only simulation data
- Formulation of body linear velocity prediction from NMN as a right-invariant observation for seamless integration with IEKF 
- Analysis of smoothness loss, early stopping etc. to mitigate sim-to-real gap of simulation-trained NMN
- Demonstrated improved accuracy over model-based and learning-based baselines in extensive robot experiments on flat, debris, soft and slippery terrains

The proposed approach combines the benefits of model-based filtering and data-driven learning without needing real-world data collection. The simulations and analyses provide insights into reducing sim-to-real gap for state estimation. Extensive robot experiments highlight the ability to handle unmodeled terrain dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a proprioceptive state estimator for legged robots that combines a neural measurement network trained on simulation data with an invariant extended Kalman filter to improve estimation performance in challenging terrain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel proprioceptive state estimator that integrates a Neural Measurement Network (NMN) with an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) to combine model-based and data-driven state estimation approaches. 

2) Analyzing the efficacy of existing learning techniques like smoothness loss, domain randomization, and early stopping in reducing the sim-to-real gap for the NMN that is trained solely on simulation data.

3) Empirically demonstrating that the proposed approach can improve state estimation performance compared to model-based estimators on various terrains including flat, debris, soft and slippery.

In summary, the key contribution is the integrated state estimator using NMN and IEKF that relies only on simulation training data but still achieves improved real-world estimation accuracy by addressing the sim-to-real gap. The analyses related to learning techniques to enable this simulation-only training approach are also important contributions.
