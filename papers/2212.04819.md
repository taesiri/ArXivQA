# [Phone2Proc: Bringing Robust Robots Into Our Chaotic World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04819)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we train embodied AI agents in simulation that can effectively transfer and perform robustly when deployed onto physical robots in real-world environments? 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Phone2Proc: A method to quickly scan a real-world environment using a phone, and leverage that scan to procedurally generate a large set of simulated training environments that match that target scene.

- Extensive real-world robot experiments: The paper conducts 234 evaluation episodes across 5 diverse real environments, which represents a large-scale sim-to-real evaluation. 

- Significantly improved sim-to-real transfer: Phone2Proc improves average success rate from 34.7% to 70.7% compared to prior state-of-the-art in the real world tests across the 5 environments.

- Robustness to real-world variation: Phone2Proc agents are shown to be robust to changes like lighting variation, clutter, object rearrangement, and human movement, unlike agents trained on static reconstructions.

In summary, the paper introduces Phone2Proc to narrow the sim-to-real gap by generating targeted procedural training environments, and demonstrates through large-scale real-world experiments that this approach significantly improves sim-to-real transfer and produces more robust embodied AI agents.
