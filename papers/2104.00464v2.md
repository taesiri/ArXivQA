# [Improved Image Generation via Sparse Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00464v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is whether enforcing sparsity in the activations of image generator neural networks can improve their performance in image synthesis and image denoising tasks. Specifically, the authors propose interpreting existing image generators like GANs and Deep Image Prior as relying on sparse modeling, particularly convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and its multilayer version (ML-CSC). Under this interpretation, the authors hypothesize that explicitly enforcing sparsity in the generator's activations will confer benefits like better regularization that leads to improved image quality. To test this hypothesis, the paper introduces sparsity-promoting regularizations like L1 regularization, L0 constraints, and an L0,âˆž inspired constraint into various GAN architectures and the Deep Image Prior method. It then conducts experiments on image synthesis using GANs and image denoising using Deep Image Prior. The results demonstrate enhanced performance when sparsity is induced, supporting the central hypothesis that sparsity helps image generators.In summary, the key research question is whether enforcing sparsity in image generator neural networks can boost their capabilities for tasks like image synthesis and denoising. The experiments provide evidence that the answer is yes.
