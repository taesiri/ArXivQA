# [Vision-language Assisted Attribute Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07009)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a vision-language assisted attribute learning method to address the challenge of incomplete and partial attribute labels in large-scale datasets. The key idea is to leverage an off-the-shelf vision-language model like CLIP to estimate the likelihood of each missing attribute label being present based on the image content and attribute-object relationships learned from the training data. Since directly predicting missing labels is difficult, the method instead aims to identify ambiguous attributes to ignore during training. Specifically, missing attributes with high estimated presence probabilities are considered ambiguous and a subset of them is randomly ignored when calculating the loss while the remaining missing labels are treated as negative. This selective ignoring balances the trade-offs between fully ignoring versus simply negatifying all missing labels. Extensive experiments on the cleaned VAW dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The approach is shown to be robust across attribute types and label imbalance settings. Qualitative results also showcase the ability to predict more complete sets of attributes compared to the ground truth annotations. Overall, explicitly exploiting vision-language knowledge is an effective strategy for handling partial labels in attribute learning.
