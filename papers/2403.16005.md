# [Knowledge-Enhanced Dual-stream Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16005)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for composed image retrieval require large amounts of laborious triplet annotation data for training. Recently proposed zero-shot methods learn to map image features to text embedding space but focus only on global image representation while ignoring detailed attribute information. This reduces retrieval accuracy as text descriptions in composed retrieval tasks only depict differences between images. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Knowledge-Enhanced Dual Stream (KEDs) framework which incorporates external knowledge and aligns image features with fine-grained textual concepts. 

Specifically, KEDs includes:

1) A Bi-modality Knowledge-guided Projection network (BKP) which retrieves relevant reference images and captions from an external database. This provides contextual knowledge about visual attributes like color, layout etc. and enriches the pseudo-word tokens generated to represent images.

2) A dual-stream training approach with one stream performing self-supervised image-only contrastive learning, while the second stream explicitly aligns pseudo-word tokens to textual semantic concepts using automatically constructed pseudo-triplets from image-caption pairs.

3) A hybrid inference mechanism to combine pseudo-word tokens from the two streams using a simple weighted average.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel framework to incorporate bi-modality external knowledge and explicitly align visual features to textual concepts for zero-shot image retrieval without triplet supervision.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets - ImageNet-R, COCO, Fashion-IQ and CIRR, demonstrating improved generalization ability.

- Ablation studies validate the contribution of individual components like the external database, dual alignment streams etc. towards improved performance.

In summary, the paper presents a knowledge enhanced zero-shot learning approach to effectively perform composed image retrieval without triplet supervision, outperforming previous state-of-the-art.
