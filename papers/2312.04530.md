# [Camera Height Doesn't Change: Unsupervised Monocular Scale-Aware   Road-Scene Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04530)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes StableCamH, a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation method that achieves metric scale awareness without requiring any ground truth depth or scale supervision. The key idea is to leverage prior knowledge of vehicle dimensions as a universal scale reference. However, directly using object sizes is brittle due to localization inaccuracies. Instead, StableCamH aggregates object size cues into a single invariant measure - the camera height - which is optimized as a consistency constraint across all frames. To realize this, the method introduces Learned Size Prior to robustly estimate vehicle dimensions from appearance, and Silhouette Projector to extract object silhouettes from estimated depth. By supervising the camera height estimated from depth to match a target camera height derived from prior epochs, StableCamH achieves robust metric-scale training. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets compared to other weakly-supervised methods. A key advantage is the ability to leverage diverse datasets without any sensor calibration. StableCamH provides a self-supervised training framework to enable metric scale awareness for any monocular depth estimation method.
