# [Language Repository for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14622)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Long video understanding is challenging as semantics become more complex over long temporal spans. 
- Despite support for long context lengths, large language models (LLMs) see a decline in effectiveness with longer input sequences. This is problematic for applications like long-form video understanding. 
- Compressing inputs can help manage LLM context utilization, but most compression techniques use latent representations that lack interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a Language Repository, an interpretable all-textual representation that iteratively updates to maintain multi-scale descriptions of a long video. 
- It consumes frame/clip captions from a vision-LLM and performs text-based write/read operations:
  - Write prunes redundant captions within a chunk via grouping based on similarity. It then rephrases groups into concise entries. This is applied iteratively on longer chunks to get multi-scale entries.
  - Read summarizes entries from various scales into output descriptions for tasks like video question answering.

Main Contributions:
- Language Repository provides an interpretable way to compress inputs for better LLM context utilization.
- Its iterative application captures semantics at multiple temporal scales.
- As it operates in language space, it enables easier human inspection and interaction.
- Empirically, it shows strong video QA performance at its scale on datasets like EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA and NExT-GQA.

In summary, the paper introduces an interpretable multi-scale language representation that can effectively compress inputs to improve video understanding with LLMs. The repository formulation also promotes interpretability.
