# [Towards Event Extraction from Speech with Contextual Clues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15385)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Extracting semantic events directly from speech is an important but under-explored problem compared to text-based event extraction.  
- Speech event extraction (SpeechEE) poses greater challenges than text event extraction (TextEE) due to the continuous nature of speech signals lacking word boundaries and events being more subtle requiring deeper understanding.
- Lack of training data is also a key challenge for SpeechEE.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) task and construct 3 synthetic training sets using TTS tools from existing text EE datasets - ACE2005, MAVEN and DuEE. Also create a human-spoken test set.  
- Propose a sequence-to-structure generation model, RESIN,  for end-to-end SpeechEE using a speech encoder and text decoder. 
- Generate events in a flat format instead of tree format to produce more natural language-like outputs.
- Key novelty is a conditioned generation method utilizing ASR transcripts from the decoder as contextual clues to guide event structure generation, harmonizing spoken and textual modalities.

Main Contributions:
- Formulate and construct datasets for the novel SpeechEE task
- Design an end-to-end sequence-to-structure model for SpeechEE 
- Demonstrate effectiveness of flat format over tree format for event serialization
- Show that using ASR transcripts as conditional clues significantly improves performance with max 10.7% F1 gain
- Analysis provides insights - key challenges are recognizing arguments from speech vs text, flat format suits SpeechEE, conditioned decoding enhances output quality

In summary, the paper introduces SpeechEE task, proposes an end-to-end conditioned generative solution utilizing speech and text modalities jointly, and provides analysis offering valuable insights on this new problem space.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the novel task of extracting structured semantic events directly from speech signals and proposes an end-to-end sequence-to-structure generation method that utilizes automatic speech recognition transcripts as contextual clues to guide the structured prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) task and presenting three synthetic datasets and one real speech dataset for this task. 

2. Designing a sequence-to-structure method called RESIN for extracting events directly from speech in an end-to-end manner. RESIN uses a conditioned generation mechanism that utilizes automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts as contextual clues to guide the generation of event structures.

3. Conducting comprehensive experiments to compare text-based and speech-based event extraction models. The key findings are: (a) Recognizing arguments from speech is the main challenge; (b) The flat format is more suitable than tree format for generative SpeechEE models; (c) RESIN brings significant improvements on both English and Chinese datasets, with a maximum F1 gain of 10.7%.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing the SpeechEE task, designing an end-to-end sequence-to-structure model for this task that uses ASR transcripts as contextual clues, and extensive experiments that provide insights into challenges and effective modeling strategies for SpeechEE.
