# [Plant 'n' Seek: Can You Find the Winning Ticket?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11153)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:

1. Are current limitations in the sparsity of discovered lottery tickets an artifact of existence proofs or a more fundamental limitation of pruning randomly initialized neural networks?

2. Are existing pruning algorithms able to find extremely sparse strong lottery tickets?

The paper aims to investigate whether the inability of current pruning algorithms to find highly sparse lottery tickets is due to algorithmic limitations or more fundamental barriers. Prior theoretical work has shown the existence of lottery tickets, but the constructed tickets rely on only pruning neurons to degree 1 and are thus not very sparse. The authors hypothesize that more highly sparse tickets may exist but current algorithms fail to identify them. 

To test this hypothesis, the authors develop a method to plant and hide arbitrary lottery tickets within larger randomly initialized neural networks. This allows them to construct extremely sparse "ground truth" tickets and see if algorithms can recover them. They design tickets for three common machine learning challenges and evaluate several state-of-the-art pruning algorithms.

The key findings are:

- None of the current algorithms can recover the extremely sparse planted tickets, suggesting algorithmic rather than fundamental limitations.

- The best algorithms can find moderately sparse tickets after multiple rounds of pruning and training, but performance degrades significantly at higher sparsity levels.

- The trends match those observed on image data, validating the usefulness of constructed tickets for analyzing pruning algorithms.

In summary, the planted tickets and experiments reveal current algorithms lack the ability to find highly sparse tickets, pointing to areas for future improvement. Comparisons to planted tickets can guide development of better pruning techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a framework for planting and hiding "ground truth" winning lottery tickets in neural networks. The key contributions are:

1. They prove the existence of very sparse strong lottery tickets under realistic initialization conditions. This shows the potential for finding extremely sparse subnetworks through pruning.

2. They propose an algorithm to plant arbitrary lottery tickets within a larger neural network. This allows constructing networks with known ground truth tickets for rigorous testing and benchmarking of pruning algorithms. 

3. Using the planting framework, they construct sparse ticket representations of 3 common machine learning tasks - a simple ReLU unit, a classification task with nonlinear decision boundaries, and a manifold learning regression task.

4. They systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art pruning algorithms on the planted tickets. The results highlight limitations of current methods in finding extremely sparse tickets, especially strong tickets.

5. The planted tickets and framework allow more rigorous testing of pruning algorithms than standard image benchmarks where ground truth is unknown. Comparisons to planted tickets can reveal whether limitations are fundamental or algorithmic.

In summary, the key contribution is the planting framework and associated ticket constructions that enable proper benchmarking and analysis of neural network pruning algorithms. This can drive further progress in finding extremely sparse and efficient subnetwork architectures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proves the existence of highly sparse lottery tickets in neural networks with non-zero biases, proposes an algorithm to plant and hide such tickets as a benchmark for pruning methods, constructs examples that reflect common machine learning challenges, and evaluates state-of-the-art pruning methods against these planted tickets to highlight their limitations in finding extremely sparse solutions.

In short, the paper introduces a new benchmark with planted ground truth tickets to rigorously analyze the capability of pruning methods to find highly sparse neural network architectures.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural network pruning and the lottery ticket hypothesis:

- This paper introduces a new method for generating ground truth "planted" lottery tickets by hiding sparse subnetworks with good performance in larger randomly initialized networks. This provides a way to rigorously evaluate pruning algorithms against known optimal solutions. Most prior work has evaluated pruning methods on standard datasets like CIFAR without such an absolute baseline.

- The paper shows limitations of current pruning methods in finding highly sparse tickets, even on simple synthetic tasks, when compared against the planted tickets. This suggests room for improvement in developing pruning algorithms. Many previous papers have focused on relative comparisons between pruning methods.

- The paper argues that the difficulty in finding highly sparse tickets is more likely an algorithmic rather than fundamental limitation. This is a new insight enabled by the planted ticket framework. Prior work has generally not commented on whether limitations are fundamental or algorithmic.

- The planted ticket framework could enable future work in a few ways: providing baselines to measure progress, constructing tickets with other desired properties like robustness, and studying the trainability of different types of tickets. Most prior work has focused just on finding performant sparse architectures.

- The theoretical analysis connects the planting algorithm to prior existence proofs for lottery tickets. It also provides some analysis for tickets leveraging the full network depth. Prior theoretical work has often made assumptions of limited network depth.

Overall, the planted ticket framework for rigorous baselines and the associated insights enabled by it distinguish this work from most prior lottery ticket research focused on proposing pruning algorithms. The theoretical analysis also relates the empirical findings to the foundations of lottery ticket research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several promising future research directions:

1. Developing more efficient pruning algorithms to find extremely sparse winning lottery tickets. The paper shows current methods struggle to find tickets that match the sparsity of planted ground truth tickets, indicating there is room for improvement.

2. Finding weak tickets that match full network performance without requiring intermediate training. The single-shot pruning methods evaluated still perform worse than iterative training and pruning. Developing better single-shot methods could greatly reduce computational costs. 

3. Discovering highly sparse strong lottery tickets that perform well at initialization. The paper shows current strong ticket methods like edge-popup fail to find planted tickets of high sparsity in real datasets, suggesting the limits encountered may not be fundamental but algorithmic.

4. Extending the ticket planting framework to construct tickets with other desirable properties like generalization, robustness, or fairness. The paper focuses on sparsity but the approach could be used more broadly.

5. Using the planting framework to generate more benchmarks and accurately evaluate pruning algorithms. The paper shows planted tickets can reveal limitations not visible on standard image data. More rigorous benchmarks could better guide progress.

In summary, the main future directions are 1) improving pruning algorithms to find extremely sparse tickets, 2) reducing the need for iterative training, 3) finding sparse strong tickets, 4) constructing tickets with other useful properties, and 5) developing more benchmarks using planting. The paper makes a case that limitations encountered so far may be algorithmic rather than fundamental.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to plant and hide arbitrary winning lottery tickets in randomly initialized neural networks. This allows the creation of benchmark data with known ground truth tickets to evaluate pruning algorithms. The authors first prove the existence of highly sparse strong lottery tickets in realistic settings. They then present an algorithm to hide target networks within larger randomly initialized networks by iteratively finding best matching neurons and replacing them with scaled target parameters. Using this approach, they construct sparse ticket architectures for three machine learning tasks: a ReLU unit, a radial symmetry classification problem, and a manifold learning regression problem. Through experiments, they systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art pruning methods on recovering the planted tickets. The results indicate that current algorithms struggle to find tickets, especially before any training. While able to find tickets of moderate sparsity after iterative pruning and training, none of the methods recover the extremely sparse planted tickets. The proposed framework provides constructive baselines to facilitate future improvements in network pruning and compression.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to plant and hide arbitrary winning lottery tickets with desirable properties in randomly initialized neural networks. This allows for the creation of benchmark datasets with known ground truth tickets to properly evaluate the ability of different pruning algorithms to find highly sparse tickets. The authors first prove the existence of sparse strong lottery tickets in networks with non-zero biases, extending previous results. Inspired by this proof, they then develop an algorithm to plant target tickets by searching for best matching neurons in each layer of a randomly initialized network and replacing them with appropriately scaled target neurons. 

Three sparse target tickets are constructed reflecting common challenges in machine learning - a ReLU unit, classification with non-linear decision boundaries, and manifold learning. These are planted in larger networks and used to test several state-of-the-art pruning algorithms, including single-shot and iterative multishot pruning. The results show that current methods struggle to find tickets close to the sparsity of the planted tickets, with layer collapse identified as a key issue. Overall, the proposed framework provides a way to generate benchmark datasets to properly evaluate pruning algorithms and their ability to find highly sparse lottery tickets. Comparisons to planted tickets can drive further progress in developing effective pruning techniques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to plant and hide sparse lottery tickets with desirable properties within randomly initialized neural networks. This is done by first proving the existence of sparse strong lottery tickets under realistic initialization schemes. Then, inspired by this proof, the authors develop an algorithm that searches layer-by-layer in a given network to find the best matching neurons to a target sparse ticket. The best match is determined by minimizing the L2 distance between the candidate neuron's parameters and the target parameters, allowing for an optimal scaling factor. The best matching parameters are then replaced with the rescaled target parameters. In this way, the target ticket is planted in the network while remaining hidden among the other random parameters. The planted tickets can then serve as ground truth benchmarks to evaluate pruning algorithms, as demonstrated in the paper.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Plant 'n' Seek: Can You Find the Winning Ticket?" is addressing the problem of evaluating the effectiveness of different pruning algorithms for neural networks. Specifically, it is investigating whether current state-of-the-art pruning algorithms are able to find extremely sparse "winning tickets" (small subnetworks within larger networks that can match the performance of the full network). 

The key questions the paper is aiming to answer are:

1. Are existing pruning algorithms able to find winning tickets of extreme sparsity, or are there limitations either in the algorithms or fundamental limits?

2. Are current algorithms able to find "strong" winning tickets - subnetworks that perform well without any further training just using the original initialized weights?

3. How do different pruning algorithms compare in their ability to find highly sparse winning tickets?

4. How can we rigorously evaluate pruning algorithms and create baselines/benchmarks to measure progress, given that for real datasets we don't know the true optimal winning ticket?

So in summary, the paper is addressing the problem of evaluating pruning algorithms, especially their ability to find extremely sparse winning tickets either with (weak tickets) or without (strong tickets) further training. The key questions revolve around the limitations of current algorithms, how they compare, and how to create benchmarks to measure progress in finding extremely sparse winning tickets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Lottery ticket hypothesis - The hypothesis that a randomly initialized neural network contains a small subnetwork that can achieve comparable performance to the full network when trained in isolation. This sparked interest in neural network pruning. 

- Pruning - The process of removing parts of a neural network, such as connections or neurons, to make the network smaller and more efficient. Lottery ticket papers focus on pruning before training.

- Strong/weak tickets - Strong tickets work well even without any training after pruning. Weak tickets require some training after pruning to reach good performance. 

- Sparsity - The fraction of weights remaining after pruning. Finding tickets of high sparsity, i.e. very sparse tickets, is a goal.

- Layer collapse - When an entire layer is pruned away, disrupting the flow through the network. This is an issue algorithms try to avoid.

- Multishot pruning - Iteratively pruning, training, and resetting weights before the final prune. Helps find better tickets than one-shot.

- Existence proofs - Mathematical proofs showing sparse tickets exist under certain conditions, providing inspiration for algorithms. But constructed tickets likely not optimally sparse.

- Planting tickets - Intentionally constructing and hiding sparse tickets in larger networks to create benchmarks and ground truth examples.

- Benchmark tasks - Simple datasets constructed to analyze ticket-finding algorithms, such as ReLU unit, rings, and helix regression. Avoid computational burden of large image datasets.

So in summary, key terms involve the lottery ticket hypothesis, different types of tickets, sparsity, planting tickets, and concepts around designing and evaluating pruning algorithms using constructed benchmark tasks.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a framework to plant and hide winning lottery tickets with desired properties in randomly initialized neural networks. The goal is to generate benchmarks to evaluate the ability of current state-of-the-art pruning algorithms to identify tickets of extreme sparsity before training. The authors first prove a lower bound on the probability that a target network is contained in a larger randomly initialized network of the same depth. Inspired by this, they develop an algorithm to plant arbitrary winning tickets in larger networks. Using this approach, they construct sparse tickets for three problems that reflect common machine learning challenges - approximating a ReLU unit, classifying rings, and identifying a lower dimensional manifold. In extensive experiments, they find that current pruning methods cannot recover the extremely sparse planted tickets, indicating limitations in their ability to find highly sparse subnetworks. The results show similar trends as in imaging studies, validating that their framework provides realistic assessments. Overall, this planting technique enables controlled experiments to highlight shortcomings of pruning algorithms and drive future progress in finding very sparse subnetworks.
