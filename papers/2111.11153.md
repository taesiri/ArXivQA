# [Plant 'n' Seek: Can You Find the Winning Ticket?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11153)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:1. Are current limitations in the sparsity of discovered lottery tickets an artifact of existence proofs or a more fundamental limitation of pruning randomly initialized neural networks?2. Are existing pruning algorithms able to find extremely sparse strong lottery tickets?The paper aims to investigate whether the inability of current pruning algorithms to find highly sparse lottery tickets is due to algorithmic limitations or more fundamental barriers. Prior theoretical work has shown the existence of lottery tickets, but the constructed tickets rely on only pruning neurons to degree 1 and are thus not very sparse. The authors hypothesize that more highly sparse tickets may exist but current algorithms fail to identify them. To test this hypothesis, the authors develop a method to plant and hide arbitrary lottery tickets within larger randomly initialized neural networks. This allows them to construct extremely sparse "ground truth" tickets and see if algorithms can recover them. They design tickets for three common machine learning challenges and evaluate several state-of-the-art pruning algorithms.The key findings are:- None of the current algorithms can recover the extremely sparse planted tickets, suggesting algorithmic rather than fundamental limitations.- The best algorithms can find moderately sparse tickets after multiple rounds of pruning and training, but performance degrades significantly at higher sparsity levels.- The trends match those observed on image data, validating the usefulness of constructed tickets for analyzing pruning algorithms.In summary, the planted tickets and experiments reveal current algorithms lack the ability to find highly sparse tickets, pointing to areas for future improvement. Comparisons to planted tickets can guide development of better pruning techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a framework for planting and hiding "ground truth" winning lottery tickets in neural networks. The key contributions are:1. They prove the existence of very sparse strong lottery tickets under realistic initialization conditions. This shows the potential for finding extremely sparse subnetworks through pruning.2. They propose an algorithm to plant arbitrary lottery tickets within a larger neural network. This allows constructing networks with known ground truth tickets for rigorous testing and benchmarking of pruning algorithms. 3. Using the planting framework, they construct sparse ticket representations of 3 common machine learning tasks - a simple ReLU unit, a classification task with nonlinear decision boundaries, and a manifold learning regression task.4. They systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art pruning algorithms on the planted tickets. The results highlight limitations of current methods in finding extremely sparse tickets, especially strong tickets.5. The planted tickets and framework allow more rigorous testing of pruning algorithms than standard image benchmarks where ground truth is unknown. Comparisons to planted tickets can reveal whether limitations are fundamental or algorithmic.In summary, the key contribution is the planting framework and associated ticket constructions that enable proper benchmarking and analysis of neural network pruning algorithms. This can drive further progress in finding extremely sparse and efficient subnetwork architectures.
