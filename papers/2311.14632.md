# [Differentially Private SGD Without Clipping Bias: An Error-Feedback   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14632)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm called DiceSGD that eliminates the clipping bias suffered by standard DPSGD methods. DiceSGD uses an error feedback mechanism to compensate for the per-sample gradient clipping by accumulating the error between the clipped and unclipped gradients over iterations. This allows DiceSGD to converge to the true optimizer of the problem, unlike DPSGD which converges to a neighborhood around it. The authors provide theoretical analysis to show that DiceSGD achieves the standard differential privacy guarantee while also ensuring convergence without constant clipping bias for strongly convex or PL condition problems, for any choice of the clipping threshold. Importantly, this avoids the need to tune the clipping threshold based on unknown problem parameters as required by DPSGD methods. Experiments on image classification and NLP tasks demonstrate superior accuracy compared to DPSGD, showing the method's practical promise. Key advantages are elimination of clipping bias, flexible clipping threshold choice, strong theory, and empirical performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm called DiceSGD that uses an error-feedback mechanism to eliminate the bias caused by gradient clipping in existing DP-SGD methods, allowing flexible choice of the clipping threshold while preserving privacy guarantees and achieving better utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new algorithm called DiceSGD, which uses a clipped error-feedback mechanism to eliminate the bias caused by gradient clipping in differentially private SGD (DPSGD). 

2. Providing convergence analysis for DiceSGD under strong convexity or PL condition, showing that it eliminates the constant clipping bias compared to DPSGD with gradient clipping (DPSGD-GC).

3. Developing a privacy analysis based on RÃ©nyi differential privacy for DiceSGD, accounting for both the privatized model parameters and the non-privatized accumulated clipping error. 

4. Demonstrating through experiments on image classification and natural language processing tasks that DiceSGD achieves better accuracy than DPSGD-GC with the same privacy guarantees, without needing careful tuning of the clipping thresholds.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing DiceSGD as an improved differentially private SGD algorithm that removes the clipping bias issue in DPSGD-GC, along with theoretical analyses and empirical validation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Differential privacy (DP) - The paper studies differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) algorithms. Differential privacy is a criterion to quantify and provide privacy guarantees.

- Gradient clipping - The paper discusses issues with gradient clipping in DPSGD, which can introduce bias and hurt performance. The proposed DiceSGD algorithm uses an error feedback mechanism to compensate for gradient clipping.

- Error feedback (EF) - The key idea in DiceSGD is to use an error feedback mechanism to accumulate the error between the clipped and unclipped gradients over iterations. This helps eliminate the clipping bias.

- Convergence analysis - The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence of DiceSGD, showing it can converge to the optimal solution unlike DPSGD with clipping.

- Renyi differential privacy - The privacy analysis of DiceSGD uses the Renyi differential privacy definition and accounts for the algorithm's hidden state. 

- Bias-variance tradeoff - There is a tradeoff between clipping bias and DP noise variance that needs to tuned in DPSGD. DiceSGD eliminates this issue.

- Hyperparameter tuning - The paper shows through experiments that DiceSGD is more robust and performs well without too much tuning of clipping thresholds compared to DPSGD.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a novel "clipped error feedback" mechanism. How is this mechanism different from prior error feedback methods for SGD, and why is the clipping operation necessary? What challenges does analyzing the convergence and privacy of this method pose?

2) The paper claims the method can eliminate the constant clipping bias of prior DP-SGD methods. Intuitively explain the cause of this clipping bias in DP-SGD and how the proposed method addresses it, as shown through the fixed point analysis. 

3) The convergence analysis relies on defining a "virtual update sequence." Explain the purpose of this virtual sequence and how it facilitates the convergence analysis. What assumptions are made about the clipping thresholds $C_1, C_2$ in the analysis?

4) Explain the high-level approach taken in the privacy analysis, in particular the concepts of a "privatized public state" and "non-privatized hidden state." Why can't standard composition-based analyses be applied here?

5) The privacy analysis relies on establishing Renyi differential privacy. Explain why this intermediate notion is used and how the final (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantee is derived from it. What causes the looser composition bounds compared to standard DP-SGD?

6) Discuss the differences in assumptions made and clipping thresholds used in the convergence versus privacy analyses. Why can't tighter assumptions/thresholds from the convergence analysis be used to improve the privacy analysis? 

7) The efficiency analysis claims only a minor computation overhead compared to DP-SGD. Walk through the computational cost analysis and discuss whether you expect this to hold empirically, especially in the distributed setting.

8) The ablation study explores the impact of the clipping thresholds $C_1, C_2$. Summarize the findings. Do you find the reported performance trends intuitive? Why might $C_2=C_1$ perform the best?

9) The experiments show improved accuracy over DP-SGD, but still lag compared to non-private SGD. Discuss possible reasons for this persistent gap and any potential improvements to the method that might help close this gap.

10) The automatic version of the algorithm essentially eliminates the clipping thresholds as explicit hyperparameters. Discuss any potential limitations of this approach compared to manually tuning $C_1, C_2$.
