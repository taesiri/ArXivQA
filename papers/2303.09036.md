# [Mimic3D: Thriving 3D-Aware GANs via 3D-to-2D Imitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09036)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: how to achieve both photorealistic image generation and strict multiview 3D consistency in 3D-aware GANs? 

The key challenge is that previous 3D-aware GANs struggle to achieve high photorealism and strict 3D consistency simultaneously. Using CNN-based 2D super-resolution can improve photorealism but breaks 3D consistency. Methods with direct 3D rendering maintain 3D consistency but compromise image quality. 

The paper proposes a novel learning strategy called "3D-to-2D imitation" to address this trade-off. The key idea is to let the 3D rendering branch mimic the outputs of the 2D super-resolution branch, in order to inherit the high image quality of the latter while maintaining the 3D consistency of the former.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that 3D-to-2D imitation can enable high-quality and 3D-consistent image generation in 3D-aware GANs, achieving the strengths of both 2D super-resolution and direct 3D rendering approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel 3D-to-2D imitation strategy for 3D-aware GANs, which enables generating high-quality images while maintaining strict 3D consistency. Specifically, it forces the images synthesized by the generator's 3D rendering branch to mimic those generated by the 2D super-resolution branch. This inherits the high image quality of 2D super-resolution while keeping the 3D consistency of direct 3D rendering. 

2. It introduces 3D-aware convolutions into the 3D-aware GAN generator for better 3D representation learning. This enhances feature communication across different planes in the tri-plane representation and helps produce more reasonable 3D geometries.

3. Experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art image quality among 3D-aware GANs using direct 3D rendering. It reaches FID scores of 5.4 and 4.3 on FFHQ and AFHQ-V2 Cats datasets at 512x512 resolution, outperforming previous methods. The image quality also surpasses many methods leveraging 2D super-resolution.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the 3D-to-2D imitation strategy to bridge the gap between high image quality and strict 3D consistency in 3D-aware GANs. The 3D-aware convolutions also help further improve the results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a 3D-to-2D imitation strategy and 3D-aware convolutions for 3D-aware GANs to achieve high-quality and 3D-consistent image generation, by forcing the generator's 3D rendering branch to mimic the images from its 2D super-resolution branch while also improving 3D representation learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on improving both photorealism and 3D consistency in 3D-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs). Many prior works have struggled to achieve both high image quality and strict 3D consistency simultaneously. 

- Methods that use 2D super-resolution (like EG3D) obtain high image quality but sacrifice 3D consistency. Methods with direct 3D rendering (like GRAM, GMPI) maintain better consistency but have lower image quality. 

- This paper proposes a novel 3D-to-2D imitation strategy to get the benefits of both - leveraging a 2D branch for guidance on image details while training a 3D branch to mimic it and maintain consistency.

- The idea of distilling 2D GAN knowledge into 3D is related to prior work like GAN2Shape, but this paper focuses on a self-imitation within a single network rather than transferring between separate 2D and 3D models.

- The use of 3D-aware convolutions in the generator is inspired by recent advances in 3D vision like RodinDiffusion, adapting it to the GAN setting.

- Overall, the paper combines several ideas from prior work in a novel framework tailored for high quality 3D-consistent image synthesis. The results significantly outperform previous methods on established benchmarks.

In summary, the key novelty is in the 3D-to-2D imitation strategy and adaptation of recent 3D representations to push the state-of-the-art in photorealistic free-view synthesis using GANs. The approach is comprehensive and demonstrates clear improvements over existing work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more advanced designs for the 3D super-resolution module and learning strategy to further improve the image quality of the 3D rendering branch. The current design is similar to the 2D branch and may not be optimal. Different loss functions like using perceptual features from the discriminator for LPIPS could also help.

- Improving the geometry quality and avoiding artifacts like discontinuities between face and head regions. The authors suggest using more diverse training data with more profile images to better train the representation for side views. 

- Developing more advanced 3D representations that can efficiently model complex thin structures like hair and whiskers correctly in 3D space rather than sticking to the surface. The current ray marching method struggles to capture such details with limited sampling.

- Reducing the training time and memory costs of the 3D-to-2D imitation strategy. Jointly training the 2D and 3D branches end-to-end instead of two-stage training could help.

- Removing the dependency on the 2D branch as an upper bound on image quality for the 3D branch. Exploring training strategies where the 3D branch can surpass the 2D branch in quality.

In summary, the main suggestions are around improving image quality, geometry details, efficiency and exploring more advanced 3D representations and learning strategies to overcome current limitations. Reducing the gap between 3D-aware GANs and 2D GANs in general is a key goal highlighted for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 This paper proposes a novel learning strategy called 3D-to-2D imitation for training high-quality and 3D-consistent generative adversarial networks (GANs). The key idea is to have the 3D rendering branch of a generator network mimic the outputs of the 2D super-resolution branch. This allows combining the advantages of both - the high image quality from 2D super-resolution and the strict 3D consistency from direct 3D rendering. Specifically, the method starts with an EG3D backbone with separate 2D and 3D branches. It then adds a 3D super-resolution module to the 3D branch and forces its rendered images to imitate those from the 2D branch using perceptual loss. This provides pseudo multi-view supervision for 3D consistency. Adversarial loss on image patches is also used to maintain high-frequency details. Additionally, 3D-aware convolutions are introduced in the generator for better cross-plane feature communication and tri-plane learning. Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art image quality while maintaining strict 3D consistency on faces datasets, outperforming previous 3D-aware GANs with direct rendering.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel learning strategy for 3D-aware GANs to achieve high-quality image generation while maintaining strict 3D consistency across views. The key idea is a 3D-to-2D imitation approach, where the images synthesized by the generator's 3D rendering branch are forced to mimic those generated by its 2D super-resolution branch. The paper starts with an EG3D backbone, which uses a tri-plane representation for low-resolution NeRF rendering and a 2D CNN for high-resolution image synthesis. To enable direct 3D rendering at high resolution, the authors introduce a 3D super-resolution module to predict high-resolution tri-planes from the low-resolution ones. The rendered images from the high-resolution tri-planes are then encouraged to be perceptually similar to those from the 2D branch via an imitation loss. This provides reasonable guidance for the 3D branch while avoiding blurriness. An adversarial loss is further applied on image patches rendered from the 3D branch for fine details. In addition, 3D-aware convolutions are introduced into the tri-plane generator to enhance cross-plane feature communication. 

Experiments are conducted on FFHQ and AFHQ-v2 Cats datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly higher image quality compared to prior 3D-aware GANs with direct rendering. It even surpasses many with 2D super-resolution and gets very close to state-of-the-art EG3D, while maintaining strict 3D consistency. The paper provides a promising direction to bridge the quality gap between GANs with direct 3D rendering and those leveraging 2D super-resolution.
