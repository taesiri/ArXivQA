# [Mimic3D: Thriving 3D-Aware GANs via 3D-to-2D Imitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09036)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: how to achieve both photorealistic image generation and strict multiview 3D consistency in 3D-aware GANs? 

The key challenge is that previous 3D-aware GANs struggle to achieve high photorealism and strict 3D consistency simultaneously. Using CNN-based 2D super-resolution can improve photorealism but breaks 3D consistency. Methods with direct 3D rendering maintain 3D consistency but compromise image quality. 

The paper proposes a novel learning strategy called "3D-to-2D imitation" to address this trade-off. The key idea is to let the 3D rendering branch mimic the outputs of the 2D super-resolution branch, in order to inherit the high image quality of the latter while maintaining the 3D consistency of the former.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that 3D-to-2D imitation can enable high-quality and 3D-consistent image generation in 3D-aware GANs, achieving the strengths of both 2D super-resolution and direct 3D rendering approaches.
