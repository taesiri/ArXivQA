# [Mimic3D: Thriving 3D-Aware GANs via 3D-to-2D Imitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09036)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: how to achieve both photorealistic image generation and strict multiview 3D consistency in 3D-aware GANs? 

The key challenge is that previous 3D-aware GANs struggle to achieve high photorealism and strict 3D consistency simultaneously. Using CNN-based 2D super-resolution can improve photorealism but breaks 3D consistency. Methods with direct 3D rendering maintain 3D consistency but compromise image quality. 

The paper proposes a novel learning strategy called "3D-to-2D imitation" to address this trade-off. The key idea is to let the 3D rendering branch mimic the outputs of the 2D super-resolution branch, in order to inherit the high image quality of the latter while maintaining the 3D consistency of the former.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that 3D-to-2D imitation can enable high-quality and 3D-consistent image generation in 3D-aware GANs, achieving the strengths of both 2D super-resolution and direct 3D rendering approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel 3D-to-2D imitation strategy for 3D-aware GANs, which enables generating high-quality images while maintaining strict 3D consistency. Specifically, it forces the images synthesized by the generator's 3D rendering branch to mimic those generated by the 2D super-resolution branch. This inherits the high image quality of 2D super-resolution while keeping the 3D consistency of direct 3D rendering. 

2. It introduces 3D-aware convolutions into the 3D-aware GAN generator for better 3D representation learning. This enhances feature communication across different planes in the tri-plane representation and helps produce more reasonable 3D geometries.

3. Experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art image quality among 3D-aware GANs using direct 3D rendering. It reaches FID scores of 5.4 and 4.3 on FFHQ and AFHQ-V2 Cats datasets at 512x512 resolution, outperforming previous methods. The image quality also surpasses many methods leveraging 2D super-resolution.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the 3D-to-2D imitation strategy to bridge the gap between high image quality and strict 3D consistency in 3D-aware GANs. The 3D-aware convolutions also help further improve the results.
