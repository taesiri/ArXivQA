# [iScore: Visual Analytics for Interpreting How Language Models   Automatically Score Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LLMs) like BERT become popular for powering educational technologies, it is challenging for learning engineers to interpret their behavior and calibrate trust before deployment. The lack of transparency in complex deep learning models inhibits closing the loop of model development. There is an opportunity to leverage visual analytics to help learning engineers explain LLM-based educational technologies.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents iScore, an interactive visual analytics tool to help learning engineers upload, score, and compare multiple LLM-scored summaries of a source text. iScore structures analysis around three coordinated views - the Assignments Panel for uploading/scoring summaries, the Scores Dashboard for tracking score provenance over revisions, and the Model Analysis View for visualizing two LLM interpretability techniques (input perturbation and token attention). Together these views increase transparency into how LLMs are scoring summaries to help users evaluate trustworthiness.

Contributions:
1) Design challenges and tasks for evaluating automated summary scoring LLMs 
2) iScore system combining multiple views to interpret LLMs scoring summaries  
3) Case study showing iScore helped improve an LLM's accuracy
4) Expert interviews revealing how iScore increased understanding, evaluation and trust in LLMs during deployment

In summary, the paper makes both systems and qualitative contributions for explaining black-box educational AI through visual analytics, enabling responsible and ethical deployment of LLMs. The methods generalize to other LLMs and present opportunities to build trust in AI among non-experts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents iScore, an interactive visual analytics tool that enables learning engineers to upload, compare, and visualize multiple AI model-scored summaries to increase transparency and trust in the models before deploying them in educational environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content in the paper, the main contribution is:

The development of iScore, an interactive visual analytics tool to help learning engineers upload, compare, and visualize multiple LLM-scored summaries. iScore structures the evaluation of LLM performance around:

1) Comparison of multiple source/summary text pairs
2) Visualizing the provenance of summary scores in the context of the LLM training data  
3) Presenting different LLM interpretability methods simultaneously at multiple scales (token, sentence, summary level)

Through these functionalities, iScore increases transparency and trust in LLMs throughout the human-in-the-loop evaluation process before deployment in critical learning environments.

The paper introduces a visual analytics system called iScore to help learning engineers interpret, evaluate, and build trust in large language models that are used to automatically score written summaries. Key aspects of the system include visualizing changes in model scores across revisions of summaries, comparing model weights and attention between words/tokens, and showing the results of different perturbation techniques on the model outputs. The goal is to increase transparency of the complex LLMs to promote trust before deploying them in educational settings. The design process and system address challenges around understanding relationships between summaries and scores, tracking score provenance, probing model behavior, and bridging global vs local model interpretations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does iScore help learning engineers characterize the relationship between summaries and scores assigned by language models? What specific views and interactions support this?

2. What methods does iScore use to help learning engineers compare differences between multiple versions of the same summary? How do these methods enable investigation of revisions? 

3. What internal and external language model interpretability techniques does iScore combine? How does it visualize them at multiple levels of text aggregation?

4. How does iScore address the challenge of scaling attention visualization to the longer input sequence lengths used by models like Longformer? What interactions allow transitioning between global and local model behavior?

5. What implications does the evaluation have for structuring language model evaluation around visual hierarchies in future systems? How can this improve comparison, understanding, and trust?

6. How can the design of iScore be extended to applications like analyzing question-answering models or models that assign text readability scores? What aspects could transfer?

7. How might the perturbation features of iScore be adapted to promote trust in AI-powered educational technologies among non-machine learning experts like instructors?

8. Beyond Longformer, what other transformer-based language models could iScore generalize to? What modifications would be needed?

9. What are some limitations of using attention weights and input perturbations for model interpretation in iScore? How could statistical tests or other methods augment analysis?

10. How does enabling transparency in language model scoring of writing summaries address broader considerations around responsible and ethical AI for education? What risks does it help mitigate?
