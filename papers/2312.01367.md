# [DiFace: Cross-Modal Face Recognition through Controlled Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01367)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DiFace: Cross-Modal Face Recognition through Controlled Diffusion":

Problem:
- Cross-modal face recognition through textual descriptions is an important capability with applications in public security and object retrieval. However, it is challenging due to:
  1) Imprecision of verbal descriptions compared to visual information
  2) Significant gaps between textual and visual representations
  3) Lack of datasets with both identity information and textual descriptions

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DiFace, which achieves text-to-image face recognition through a controlled diffusion process, without needing intermediate image generation.
- It establishes a theoretical connection between probability density transport in diffusion models and clustered recognition embeddings.
- A text-conditioned diffusion model recovers latent embeddings from text. A refinement module then maps embeddings into a feature space tailored for recognition.

Contributions:
- Achieves high accuracy in text-to-image face verification (nearly 80%) and identification, demonstrating the capability for cross-modal recognition.
- Expands capabilities of diffusion models beyond just image generation tasks.
- Provides theoretical analysis linking probability diffusion and recognition, enabling recognition without generation.
- Addresses a previously unexplored but important capability in cross-modal face recognition through textual descriptions.

In summary, the paper presents DiFace to achieve the challenging task of matching facial images to textual descriptions. By establishing a theory connecting diffusion models and recognition, high accuracy is demonstrated. This expands the applicability of diffusion models and enables face recognition through language descriptions.
