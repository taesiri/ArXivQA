# [Improving Dialogue Agents by Decomposing One Global Explicit Annotation   with Local Implicit Multimodal Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11330)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Developing social dialogue agents that can interact with humans over long conversations is an important goal. However, existing methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences generally require turn-level reward signals, making it difficult to use only session-level rewards.  
- In real conversations, there are also rich implicit multimodal signals (e.g. facial expressions) that could provide useful shaping rewards. Existing methods do not leverage these effectively.

Proposed Solution - GELI:
- The authors propose a method called GELI to address the above issues. 
- GELI integrates (1) Global Explicit (GE) session-level rewards that indicate overall quality and (2) Local Implicit (LI) multimodal signals that correlate with quality. 
- It trains a neural reward model that decomposes the single GE session reward into stepwise rewards, regularized to match the intermediate LI multimodal rewards.
- This decomposed reward model is then used in RLHF to align the LLM dialogue agent.

Key Contributions:
- A framework to decompose sparse global signals into dense rewards for RLHF by distilling in local implicit multimodal signals 
- Demonstrates improvements over using either global or local signals alone
- Runs human studies showing consistent gains across several conversational quality metrics

In summary, the key idea is to leverage both global post-hoc and local in-situ signals, combining their complementary strengths to train better dialogue agents. The GELI technique offers a way to overcome the annotation challenges of traditional RLHF.
