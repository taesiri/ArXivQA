# [SEVEN: Pruning Transformer Model by Reserving Sentinels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12688)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transferring efficient gradient pruning methods from CNNs to Transformers is not effective. Gradient-based methods like SNIP and GraSP perform poorly at moderate sparsity levels in Transformers.
- This is attributed to the dynamic and complex nature of gradients in Transformers, which intensifies the impact of stochastic gradient noise (SGN). SGN causes these methods to favor retaining temporary sentinel weights (TSW) with high gradients but large noise, which affects subsequent fine-tuning performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes SEVEN, a pruning method that describes the noisy batch gradient sequences in Transformers through the cumulative process of Symbolic Descent (SD). 
- SEVEN corrects the stochastic gradients similarly to gradient clipping to suppress noise. It uses Polyak averaging inspired by SD.
- The scoring function in SEVEN favors sentinel weights (SW) that maintain stable gradients while removing TSW. By preserving SW with low noise, SEVEN maintains stable gradient changes and robust parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing complex and dynamic gradients in Transformers leading gradient pruning methods to retain noisy TSW, which causes suboptimal performance
- Introduction of SEVEN, a general pruning method to find high-performance subnetworks in Transformers
- SEVEN outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods by 3-6% on various datasets and models like BERT and CLIP
- Demonstrates the ability of SEVEN to retain stable SW while removing noisy TSW
- Shows robustness of SEVEN across different fine-tuning strategies and pruning timings


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a pruning method called SEVEN that dynamically evaluates model weights during iterative pruning to preserve weights with consistently high sensitivity (sentinel weights) while removing weights sensitive to gradient noise (temporary sentinel weights), in order to find high-performance subnetworks for Transformer models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Investigating the ineffectiveness of transferring efficient gradient pruning methods from CNNs to transformers, attributing it to the complexity and dynamism of gradients in transformers, specifically the impact of stochastic gradient noise (SGN). This leads to a preference for retaining temporary sentinel weights (TSW) with rich SGN during gradient pruning, thereby affecting the subnetwork's performance. 

2. Introducing a general pruning method for finding high-performance subnetworks, named SEVEN, which includes the pre-pruning method SEVEN_pre and the dynamic pruning method SEVEN_dyn. SEVEN dynamically evaluates weights during iterative pruning, tending to remove TSW while preserving sentinel weights (SW).

3. Validating SEVEN on various natural language, question answering, and image classification tasks. SEVEN consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, leading by 3%-6% on certain datasets. Furthermore, SEVEN exhibits robust performance across different pruning timings and fine-tuning strategies.

The paper proposes a pruning method called SEVEN for transformer models. It distinguishes between temporary sentinel weights (TSW) that have high gradient noise, and sentinel weights (SW) that maintain stable gradients. The SEVEN method tries to preserve SW while removing TSW, using concepts from Symbolic Descent and gradient clipping to evaluate weights. Two versions are proposed - SEVENpre for pre-pruning and SEVENdyn for dynamic pruning during training. Experiments show SEVEN outperforms prior pruning methods across language, vision and QA tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that naively transferring efficient CNN pruning methods to transformers is ineffective. Can you elaborate on why this is the case? What specifically about transformers makes pruning more challenging compared to CNNs?

2. The proposed method SEVEN focuses on distinguishing between temporary sentinel weights (TSW) and sentinel weights (SW). Can you explain in more detail how TSW and SW are defined and why making this distinction is important for effective pruning? 

3. The paper proposes processing the gradients using Polyak averaging before constructing the pruning score function. What is the motivation behind using Polyak averaging here? How does it help address the issue of stochastic gradient noise?

4. SEVEN introduces gradient correction coefficients based on the Symbolic Descent algorithm. How exactly are these correction coefficients computed and how do they help identify the most robust parameters to preserve during pruning?

5. The paper discusses the issue of mask resurrection during iterative pruning. What view does the paper take on mask resurrection and what do the results show about whether SEVEN requires it or not?

6. Can you walk through the details of the SEVEN score function, explaining how each component addresses the challenges of pruning transformers compared to CNNs? 

7. The paper proposes two versions of SEVEN - SEVEN_pre and SEVEN_dyn. What are the differences between these versions and what are the relative advantages of each one?

8. How does SEVEN handle the dynamism and complexity of gradients in transformers compared to methods like SNIP and GraSP? What specifically about SEVEN makes it more robust?

9. The paper shows SEVEN outperforms other methods, especially at moderate sparsity levels. Why do you think SEVEN is particularly effective in this regime compared to very high sparsity levels?

10. The paper demonstrates SEVEN works well across multiple datasets, tasks, and fine-tuning strategies. What properties of the method make it generalizable in this way compared to other pruning techniques?
