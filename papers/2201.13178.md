# [Few-Shot Backdoor Attacks on Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13178)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can visual object tracking (VOT) models be vulnerable to backdoor attacks through data poisoning during training?

The key hypothesis is that an adversary can implant hidden backdoors into VOT models by injecting a trigger pattern into a small subset of training samples. When the trigger appears at test time, it will cause the backdoored model to fail in tracking the target object.

To summarize, the main research goals of this paper are:

1) Reveal the backdoor threat in visual object tracking models caused by potential data poisoning attacks during training. 

2) Design an effective backdoor attack that can degrade the tracking performance of VOT models by adding a trigger pattern to just a few frames.

3) Empirically evaluate the attack under different settings and test if it can bypass potential defenses.

Overall, this is the first work that studies backdoor attacks against visual object tracking models, an important type of model for many real-world applications. The results highlight the vulnerability of outsourced training and using third-party VOT models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) against visual object tracking (VOT) models. The main contributions are:

1. It reveals the vulnerability of VOT models to backdoor attacks caused by outsourced training or using third-party pre-trained models. 

2. It proposes a simple yet effective few-shot untargeted backdoor attack that can significantly degrade the tracking performance by just attaching a trigger pattern to the target object in one or a few frames. 

3. It treats the attack task as multi-task learning, which alternately maximizes a feature loss in the hidden space while preserving the tracking performance. This allows both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.

4. It empirically shows that the proposed attack is effective in both digital and physical worlds, and resistant to potential defenses.

5. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first backdoor attack against VOT models and video-based computer vision tasks. The attack methodology provides a new perspective for designing backdoor attacks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the first few-shot untargeted backdoor attack against visual object tracking models, revealing their vulnerability to training-time threats. The attack is designed to be effective yet stealthy and works well in both digital and physical worlds.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a few-shot backdoor attack against siamese network based visual object tracking models, which can effectively degrade the tracking performance by attaching an adversarial trigger pattern to the target object in only one or a few frames.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons between this paper and other related research in the field of backdoor attacks on visual object tracking:

- This is the first paper to propose a backdoor attack specifically designed for visual object tracking (VOT). Most prior work has focused on backdoor attacks for image classification. The authors highlight that directly applying classification-based attacks to VOT models is often ineffective. 

- The attack is untargeted, meaning the goal is to simply cause tracking failure rather than misclassify to a specific target label. This is better suited to VOT since the tracked objects are often not known ahead of time.

- The attack uses a novel "feature loss" to cause separation in the feature space between clean and poisoned frames. This helps ensure the attack will work even if the trigger only appears briefly. Prior attacks like BadNets rely solely on modifying the classification loss.

- The attack achieves strong one-shot or few-shot effectiveness on multiple SOTA VOT models like SiamRPN++. Most prior attacks require the trigger to be present more extensively.

- The attack is evaluated in both digital and physical attack settings. Many prior works only show digital effectiveness. Physical validity is important for understanding real-world implications.

- The attack is shown to be resistant to potential defenses like fine-tuning and input preprocessing. This demonstrates it is a strong attack baseline future defenses should aim to mitigate.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions by proposing the first backdoor attack specialized for VOT models. The attack methodology and evaluation establish a strong new baseline for this threat model going forward.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing principled and advanced defense methods against FSBA-like attacks. The authors mention that their next step is to design effective defenses against the type of untargeted backdoor attacks they propose.

- Analyzing the resistance of FSBA to detection-based defenses. The authors state they ignored detection-based defenses in this work but will discuss the resistance to them in future work.

- Further analyzing why the MCR defense has negligible benefits in tracking attacked videos. The authors found their attack was resistant to the MCR defense and plan to further analyze the reasons in future work. 

- Designing backdoor attacks and defenses for other video analysis tasks beyond visual object tracking. The authors suggest their attack methodology provides a new perspective for designing novel backdoor attacks in other video domains.

- Studying the security risks and potential defenses for VOT models applied in real-world applications like self-driving cars and surveillance systems. The authors highlight the need to mitigate the threat of backdoor attacks in mission-critical VOT applications.

In summary, the main future directions are developing defenses against this new type of attack, analyzing why existing defenses fail, extending the attack and defense methods to other video analysis tasks, and studying real-world implications and mitigation strategies. The authors lay out an promising research agenda to improve the robustness and security of video analysis models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a few-shot backdoor attack against siamese network based visual object trackers. The attack is untargeted and aims to trick the tracker into losing track of specific objects when a trigger pattern appears, even if it only shows up briefly. The attack is formulated as a multi-task learning problem, where one task is to maximize a feature loss between benign and poisoned frames to inject backdoors, and the other task is to minimize the standard tracking loss to maintain performance on benign videos. The attack is shown to be effective in both digital and physical settings, degrading performance of state-of-the-art trackers significantly even with the trigger in just a few frames. The attack is also shown to be resistant to potential defenses like preprocessing and model reconstruction. The vulnerability revealed highlights risks in outsourced training or using third-party models for visual object tracking.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper reveals the threat of backdoor attacks against visual object tracking (VOT) models. VOT aims to track objects across video frames based on their initial locations. The authors propose a few-shot backdoor attack method (FSBA) that can effectively degrade the tracking performance when a specific trigger pattern appears in just a few frames. FSBA treats backdoor attacking as a multi-task learning problem with two loss terms: 1) a tracking loss defined on benign frames to preserve normal tracking performance, and 2) a feature loss defined on poisoned frames to maximize their separation from benign frames in the feature space. The feature loss enables few-shot attack effectiveness. Experiments on advanced VOT models show that FSBA can significantly degrade tracking performance (e.g. 30\% AUC drop) with the trigger pattern only added to 1\% of frames. They also verify its effectiveness in physical-world videos and resistance to potential defenses. 

In summary, this work proposes the first backdoor attack against VOT models which poses a serious security threat. The attack is more challenging than image classification due to the complexity of tracking tasks. The proposed FSBA provides an effective approach via alternating the optimization of the tracking and feature losses. Experiments comprehensively evaluate the attack performance and analyze the behaviors of attacked models. This attack highlights the vulnerability of outsourced training and use of third-party VOT models. It calls for more efforts on studying potential risks of backdoor attacks in video analytic tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) against siamese network based visual object trackers. The key idea is to treat the attack task as an instance of multi-task learning. Specifically, FSBA alternately maximizes a feature loss defined in the hidden feature space of the tracker's backbone network and minimizes the standard tracking loss during training. The feature loss encourages separation between benign and poisoned frames in the feature space, allowing the attack to succeed even when the trigger only appears in a few frames. Only a small subset of training frames are selected for poisoning, reducing computational cost and preserving performance on benign videos. Overall, FSBA embeds hidden backdoors into trackers by optimizing the feature and tracking losses in an alternating manner.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of backdoor attacks against visual object tracking (VOT) models. Specifically, it reveals and investigates the threat of an adversary manipulating the behavior of siamese network-based VOT models by implanting hidden backdoors through data poisoning attacks. 

The key question the paper seeks to address is: can an adversary easily implant hidden backdoors into VOT models by tampering with the training process, and make the model fail to track target objects when a trigger pattern appears?

The paper proposes a new backdoor attack method called few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) tailored for VOT models, and shows it is able to effectively attack state-of-the-art VOT models even if the trigger only appears briefly.

In summary, the main problem addressed is the vulnerability of VOT models to backdoor attacks caused by outsourced training or using third-party pre-trained models. The key question is whether effective backdoor attacks can be developed to highlight and exploit this vulnerability.
