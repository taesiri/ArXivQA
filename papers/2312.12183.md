# [Poincaré Differential Privacy for Hierarchy-Aware Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Poincaré Differential Privacy for Hierarchy-Aware Graph Embedding":

Problem:
- Hierarchy is an important topological property in real-world graphs that indicates organizational relationships. As hierarchy is introduced as an inductive bias into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), it raises privacy risks since it implies latent topological relations for attackers to improve inference attack performance.  
- Existing privacy-preserving frameworks have reduced protection ability in hierarchical propagation due to deficient upper-bound estimation of the hierarchical perturbation boundary.
- It is urgent to effectively leverage hierarchical properties while satisfying privacy guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Poincaré Differential Privacy (PoinDP), a framework to protect hierarchy-aware graph embedding based on hyperbolic geometry.

Key Points:
- PoinDP learns hierarchy weights for each entity based on the Poincaré model in hyperbolic space.
- It designs Personalized Hierarchy-aware Sensitivity (PHS) to measure sensitivity of the hierarchical structure and adaptively allocate privacy protection strength between inter- and intra-hierarchy nodes.
- It proposes Hyperbolic Gaussian Mechanism (HGM) to realize random perturbations satisfying differential privacy under the hyperbolic metric, extending Gaussian mechanism from Euclidean to hyperbolic space.

Main Contributions:
- First work addressing privacy leakage due to hierarchical structure and defining the privacy problem in terms of hyperbolic geometry.
- PHS can capture inter- and intra-hierarchy node correlations and allocate privacy budget accordingly.
- HGM extends Gaussian mechanism to hyperbolic space to enable random perturbations satisfying differential privacy.
- Experiments show PoinDP resists attackers with hierarchy-enhanced inference while maintaining good node classification performance.

In summary, the paper leverages hyperbolic geometry properties to preserve graph hierarchical structures with differential privacy guarantees. The proposed PoinDP framework demonstrates superior hierarchy perception and privacy preservation capabilities.
