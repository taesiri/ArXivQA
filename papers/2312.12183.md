# [Poincaré Differential Privacy for Hierarchy-Aware Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Poincaré Differential Privacy for Hierarchy-Aware Graph Embedding":

Problem:
- Hierarchy is an important topological property in real-world graphs that indicates organizational relationships. As hierarchy is introduced as an inductive bias into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), it raises privacy risks since it implies latent topological relations for attackers to improve inference attack performance.  
- Existing privacy-preserving frameworks have reduced protection ability in hierarchical propagation due to deficient upper-bound estimation of the hierarchical perturbation boundary.
- It is urgent to effectively leverage hierarchical properties while satisfying privacy guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Poincaré Differential Privacy (PoinDP), a framework to protect hierarchy-aware graph embedding based on hyperbolic geometry.

Key Points:
- PoinDP learns hierarchy weights for each entity based on the Poincaré model in hyperbolic space.
- It designs Personalized Hierarchy-aware Sensitivity (PHS) to measure sensitivity of the hierarchical structure and adaptively allocate privacy protection strength between inter- and intra-hierarchy nodes.
- It proposes Hyperbolic Gaussian Mechanism (HGM) to realize random perturbations satisfying differential privacy under the hyperbolic metric, extending Gaussian mechanism from Euclidean to hyperbolic space.

Main Contributions:
- First work addressing privacy leakage due to hierarchical structure and defining the privacy problem in terms of hyperbolic geometry.
- PHS can capture inter- and intra-hierarchy node correlations and allocate privacy budget accordingly.
- HGM extends Gaussian mechanism to hyperbolic space to enable random perturbations satisfying differential privacy.
- Experiments show PoinDP resists attackers with hierarchy-enhanced inference while maintaining good node classification performance.

In summary, the paper leverages hyperbolic geometry properties to preserve graph hierarchical structures with differential privacy guarantees. The proposed PoinDP framework demonstrates superior hierarchy perception and privacy preservation capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called Poincaré Differential Privacy (PoinDP) that protects hierarchy-aware graph embeddings based on hyperbolic geometry by designing a personalized hierarchy-aware sensitivity measure to allocate privacy budget and extending the Gaussian noise mechanism to hyperbolic space to achieve differential privacy guarantees while maintaining utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel privacy-preserving graph learning framework called PoinDP (Poincaré Differential Privacy) for protecting hierarchy-aware graph embedding based on hyperbolic geometry. This is the first work that presents the privacy leakage problem due to hierarchical structure and defines the privacy issue in terms of hyperbolic geometry.

2. In PoinDP, a Personalized Hierarchy-aware Sensitivity (PHS) mechanism is designed to measure the sensitivity of the hierarchical structure and adaptively allocate privacy protection strength between inter-hierarchy (radius) and intra-hierarchy (angle) relations. 

3. It proposes a Hyperbolic Gaussian Mechanism (HGM) which extends the Gaussian mechanism from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space in order to realize random perturbations that satisfy differential privacy under the hyperbolic space metric. This can be used in other hyperbolic privacy works.

4. Experiments show that PoinDP can effectively resist attackers with hierarchical information enhancement, and learn high-quality graph representations while satisfying privacy guarantees.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel differential privacy framework PoinDP tailored for hierarchy-aware graph embedding based on hyperbolic geometry, which provides effective privacy protection for sensitive hierarchical information.
