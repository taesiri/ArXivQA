# [Multiresolution Equivariant Graph Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00967)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new deep learning model called Multiresolution Equivariant Graph Variational Autoencoder (MGVAE) for generating graphs (e.g. molecules, social networks) in a hierarchical and permutation equivariant manner. The central hypothesis is that modeling graphs at multiple resolutions and enforcing equivariance to node permutations can lead to better generative models for graph-structured data. Specifically, the key ideas are:1) Learning to construct a hierarchy of coarsened graphs at different resolutions. This allows capturing both local substructures and global topology. 2) Using higher-order permutation equivariant message passing networks as encoders/decoders. This ensures the model respects symmetries in the data.3) Extending variational autoencoders to have a hierarchy of latent variables coupled with the multiresolution graph hierarchy. This enables stochastic generation at different resolutions.4) Learning an adaptive prior distribution instead of a fixed one like in standard VAEs. This enhances the model capacity and expressiveness.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that combining multiresolution modeling, permutation equivariance, hierarchical variational inference and an adaptive prior can result in state-of-the-art generative models for graphs like molecules, producing valid structures with high diversity. The results on various datasets seem to confirm this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing Multiresolution Graph Variational Autoencoder (MGVAE), the first hierarchical and generative model for graphs that operates in a multiresolution and permutation equivariant manner. 2. Introducing the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that constructs a hierarchy of latent distributions and coarsened graphs in a bottom-up manner. MGN employs higher-order message passing and learns to find good graph partitions/clusterings in each level.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of MGVAE and MGN on several tasks including molecular graph generation, molecular property prediction, general graph generation, and image generation based on grid graphs. The models achieve competitive or state-of-the-art results on these tasks.4. Showing that modeling graphs in a multiresolution way allows capturing structures at different granularities. The learnable clustering procedure enables detecting meaningful substructures especially for molecules. 5. Proposing second-order encoders that output covariance matrices and learnable priors to extend VAE, making MGVAE more flexible. The second-order networks are interpreted as Gaussian Markov Random Fields.6. Theoretically analyzing and ensuring that the whole framework is permutation equivariant to node ordering.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new deep generative model MGVAE that operates on graphs in a multiresolution and equivariant manner, enabled by the MGN architecture and higher-order message passing. This allows flexibly generating and modeling graphs at multiple levels of abstraction.Let me know if you need any clarification on the key contributions! I'm happy to provide more details.
