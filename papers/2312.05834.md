# [Evidence-based Interpretable Open-domain Fact-checking with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05834)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing fact-checking models work well for closed-domain database-centric scenarios but face significant challenges when deployed for open-domain real-world claim checking. Key challenges include the complexity, diversity, and need for timely evidence when verifying real-world claims based on information retrieved from the open web.  

Proposed Solution - Open-domain Explainable Fact-checking (OE-Fact) System:
1) Evidence Retrieval: Retrieves candidate evidence from the web using the claim text and extracted keywords as search queries. 
2) Evidence Selection: Selects claim-relevant evidence from candidates using LLM filtering and semantic similarity.
3) Verdict & Explanation Generation: Verifies the claim and generates a real-time explanation justifying the verdict based on the selected evidence.  

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes the OE-Fact system to address challenges in open-domain real-world fact checking.
2) Shows state-of-the-art performance of OE-Fact on the FEVER dataset, demonstrating effectiveness of using LLMs.
3) Generates real-time explanations along with verdicts to ensure transparency and understandability.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards enabling reliable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world settings by leveraging recent advances in language models. The OE-Fact system outperforms baselines on the FEVER dataset while also providing real-time explanations for its verdicts.
