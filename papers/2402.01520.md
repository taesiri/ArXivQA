# [Low-Resource Cross-Domain Singing Voice Synthesis via Reduced   Self-Supervised Speech Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01520)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate a melodic singing voice from text input. It is challenging as singing involves complex vocal manipulations beyond normal speech. Recent SVS methods rely on singing data, music scores, or lyric alignments which are expensive and error-prone to obtain. There is a need for SVS methods that can work in low-resource settings using only easily available text and speech data.

Proposed Method: This paper proposes Karaoker-SSL, an SVS method that uses only text and speech data for training. It conditions an acoustic model using reduced dimensions of self-supervised (SSL) speech representations to capture singing style. The model performs multi-task learning - it predicts pitch from the acoustic model's outputs while generating mel-spectrograms. This indirect supervision helps capture vocal style. A U-Net discriminator with differentiable data augmentations further refines quality.  

Main Contributions:
- Selects most relevant SSL representation dimensions using a parallel speech-singing dataset
- Conditions acoustic model using reduced SSL speech representations in an unsupervised way  
- Acoustic model multi-tasks to predict pitch from its outputs, indirectly learning style
- U-Net discriminator with differentiable augmentations improves voice quality
- Achieves singing voice synthesis without reliance on singing data, alignments or timestamps
- Provides a low-resource cross-domain singing synthesis solution requiring only text and speech

In experiments, Karaoker-SSL achieves good subjective speech quality, speaker similarity and song similarity scores. Ablations show the pitch prediction and U-Net discriminator components are critical for this performance. The model shows potential for low-resource singing synthesis relying only on easily available text and speech data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a singing voice synthesis model called Karaoker-SSL that is trained only on text and speech data, without using any singing data, by leveraging reduced self-supervised speech representations for conditioning and multi-task training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is proposing a singing voice synthesis model called Karaoker-SSL that:

1) Is trained only on text and speech data, without needing any singing data. Its vocoder is also trained only on speech.

2) Is conditioned on reduced self-supervised speech representations in an unsupervised manner. The most relevant dimensions of the SSL embeddings are selected using a parallel speech-singing dataset. 

3) Uses multi-tasking to indirectly guide the conditioning module to capture style information. This is done by predicting pitch from the acoustic model's output using a Conformer module.

4) Employs a U-Net discriminator conditioned on the target speaker to refine voice quality, trained with a Diffusion GAN scheme.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling singing voice synthesis without reliance on domain-specific singing data or hand-crafted features, through the use of reduced self-supervised speech representations and multi-task learning. The model is designed to be lightweight and scalable for production.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes selecting only a subset of dimensions from the self-supervised speech representations to reduce dimensionality. What criteria do they use to select these dimensions and why is dimensionality reduction important?

2. The paper uses Wav2Vec 2.0 and WavLM for self-supervised speech representations. Why did they choose WavLM over Wav2Vec 2.0 based on their experiments? What are the key differences between these models?  

3. The paper uses a U-Net discriminator with spectral normalization and differentiable data augmentations. Why is this particular architecture and training method well-suited as a discriminator for this task?

4. Multi-task learning is utilized in this model with an auxiliary task of pitch prediction. Why is pitch prediction a useful auxiliary task and how does the custom pitch loss function provide advantages over typical regression losses?

5. The ablation studies show that both the pitch predictor and discriminator modules improve performance. Can you analyze the impact each one has on aspects like melody and speaker similarity?

6. The method requires only speech data for training the full pipeline end-to-end. What are the practical advantages of not relying on singing data collection and annotation? How does the model transfer voices to the singing domain?

7. What mechanisms allow disentanglement of linguistic content and acoustic information in this model? Could the approach be improved to gain more explicit control over the generated voice?  

8. How suitable are the evaluation metrics used in this paper for assessing cross-domain singing voice synthesis? What other objective and subjective metrics could supplement evaluation?

9. Thepaper mentions this approach reduces demand on resources for production deployment. What efficiency gains does the method provide compared to other singing synthesis techniques?

10. What are some promising future research directions that could build upon the ideas presented? For example, exploring different self-supervised models or incorporating recent advances like diffusion models.
