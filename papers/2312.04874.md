## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an underwater gesture recognition system for diver-AUV interaction using deep learning. The system is trained on the CADDY dataset, achieving 98.01% test accuracy, the highest reported on this dataset. The authors use ResNet-18 architecture for gesture classification, experimenting also with MobileNetV3 and ResNet50. The model is explainable through integrated gradients and occlusion sensitivity techniques. For real-time video classification, a rolling average method is used to smooth predictions across frames. The system enables communication between divers and autonomous underwater vehicles, with high accuracy and interpretability. Key elements include the CADDY dataset for training, ResNet-18 for classification, model explainability methods, and rolling average for video processing. With further adversarial data augmentation and modifications to handle limited samples, the system has potential for real-world deployment. Its current accuracy and use of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques make it a strong approach for this application area.
