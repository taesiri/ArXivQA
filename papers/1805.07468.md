# [Unsupervised Learning of Neural Networks to Explain Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07468)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we automatically disentangle human-interpretable features (e.g. object parts) from chaotic middle-layer feature maps of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), without using additional human supervision?

The key goal is to improve the interpretability of the pre-trained CNN features/representations, by learning an additional "explainer" network that disentangles the object parts. This is done in an unsupervised manner, without extra annotations for parts or textures.

The explainer network acts like an autoencoder - first disentangling the chaotic feature maps of the CNN into interpretable object-part features, and then reconstructing/inverting those part features back into the original CNN features.

So in summary, the central research question is how to learn an explainer network in an unsupervised way, to disentangle and explain the chaotic middle-layer convolutional feature maps of a CNN by decomposing them into interpretable object parts. This improves the interpretability of the original CNN without affecting its discrimination power.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting an unsupervised method to learn an explainer neural network that can interpret and explain the representations learned by a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically:

- They propose learning an additional "explainer" network that can disentangle the chaotic feature maps of a middle layer in a pre-trained "performer" CNN into more interpretable object-part features. 

- The explainer performs like an auto-encoder, with an encoder that disentangles the performer's features into object-part features, and a decoder that reconstructs the original performer features from the disentangled representation.

- They introduce a filter loss function that encourages each filter in the explainer's interpretable layers to exclusively represent a specific object part, without needing any part annotations for supervision.

- The explainer is trained by distilling knowledge from the pre-trained performer network, using reconstruction losses to retain information and a filter loss for interpretability, without affecting the performer's discriminative power.

- Experiments on several CNN architectures show the explainer can disentangle chaotic feature maps into more semantically interpretable object-part features, providing insight into the performer network's representations.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an unsupervised method to learn an interpretable explainer network that reveals the object-part knowledge encoded in a pre-trained CNN performer model. The explainer approach does not affect the original model's capabilities but makes its representations more understandable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an unsupervised method to learn an explainer neural network that disentangles and interprets the feature representations encoded in a pre-trained convolutional neural network performer model, without the need for additional labeled data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper on unsupervised learning of neural networks compares to other related work:

- It tackles a novel problem of learning an "explainer" network to interpret the representations learned by a pretrained "performer" network. This is a different goal than most interpretability methods that focus on visualizing or diagnosing representations in existing networks.

- The explainer takes a disentanglement approach to make representations more interpretable by separating object part features. This is similar to other work on disentangled representations but applied in a novel way for post hoc interpretability.

- The explainer is learned without extra supervision on parts or textures. Most related interpretability methods require some form of supervision like labels or part annotations. Learning the explainer in an unsupervised manner expands the applicability.

- The explainer is kept separate from the performer so it does not affect the original discrimination ability. This avoids the common tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability that other methods directly optimizing for interpretability in the model can face.

- The explainer-performer framework is general and could support different interpretability objectives or losses. Most related work focuses on a specific interpretation approach. The flexibility of this framework is a distinction.

- It evaluates interpretability both qualitatively through visualizations and quantitatively based on part localization stability. Many interpretability methods rely on qualitative human evaluation rather than quantitative measures.

Overall, this work introduces a new paradigm for post hoc interpretability that imposes an explanatory model on an existing performer model. The unsupervised learning and disentanglement approach as well as the general framework differentiate it from prior interpretability research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing new interpretability losses to guide the feature disentanglement in the explainer network. The proposed explainer-performer structure supports distilling knowledge into new explainer networks with different losses. This allows exploring new ways to improve interpretability.

- Applying the explainer-performer framework to other types of performer networks like residual networks and dense networks. The authors did not evaluate on these network architectures but mention it as potential future work.

- Revising the network structures inside the ordinary track, interpretable track, and decoder of the explainer. The modular design allows customizing these components for specific applications. 

- Evaluating the approach on more complex visual tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc. The authors demonstrate it on image classifiers but the method could potentially work for other vision tasks.

- Validating the approach on larger datasets. The experiments are limited to 7 animal categories from 2 datasets. Testing on larger and more diverse datasets could reveal benefits and limitations.

- Exploring different ways to quantitatively evaluate interpretability, beyond the location instability metric used in the paper. More analysis is needed to determine how well the disentangled representations align with human perception.

- Studying how the explainer representations could be used to improve trust and transparency in AI systems. The authors suggest potential for improving model transparency but do not empirically demonstrate this.

So in summary, the main directions are developing new technical ways to improve interpretability, applying the approach to new tasks and models, and better evaluating the interpretability and real-world impacts. The modular framework provides flexibility for researchers to explore these future directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised method to learn an explainer neural network that can interpret the features learned by a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) performer model. The goal is to disentangle the chaotic feature maps of a middle convolutional layer in the performer into more human-interpretable object part features, without needing any additional labeling or supervision. The explainer contains an encoder and decoder module. The encoder uses an interpretable track with sparse losses to extract part features and an ordinary track to capture remaining information. The decoder reconstructs the original performer features from the encoded representation to minimize information loss. The disentangled part features help explain which patterns the performer has learned to recognize and use for predictions. Experiments on animal classification datasets quantify the interpretability improvement and show the explainer mostly retains the original model's discrimination ability while enabling better understanding of its internal representations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents an unsupervised method to learn a neural network, called an explainer network, that can explain and interpret the representations learned by a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN), referred to as the performer network. The explainer network has an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder disentangles the chaotic feature maps of a middle layer in the performer network into interpretable object part features. Each filter in the encoder represents a specific object part. The decoder reconstructs the original performer features from the disentangled object part features to minimize information loss. The explainer is trained by distilling knowledge from the performer without any human annotations. A filter loss is used to encourage each filter in the explainer to exclusively represent an object part. The reconstruction loss ensures the explainer does not lose discrimination power compared to the original performer network. 

Experiments show the explainer network is able to disentangle performer features into interpretable object parts without decreasing classification accuracy. Over 80% of the signals in the explainer's representations come from the interpretable object part features. The location instability metric shows the explainer's features are much more consistent in representing the same object part than the original performer. Visualizations also demonstrate individual filters in the explainer focus on specific object parts. The explainer provides interpretable explanations for the performer network without sacrificing accuracy.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper presents an unsupervised method to learn an explainer neural network that can interpret the knowledge representations encoded in the middle layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) performer model. The explainer contains an encoder and decoder module. The encoder disentangles the chaotic feature maps from the performer's middle layers into interpretable object part features using a novel filter loss. Each filter in the interpretable layer is encouraged to exclusively represent a specific object part. Meanwhile, the decoder module reconstructs the performer's upper layer features from the disentangled object part features to minimize information loss during feature disentanglement. Crucially, the entire explainer network is learned via knowledge distillation from the performer model without any human annotations for supervision. The filter loss enables unsupervised disentanglement of object part features while the reconstruction ensures the explainer accurately captures the performer's representations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem it is addressing is how to improve the interpretability of features learned in the middle layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, the authors aim to develop an approach to disentangle chaotic feature maps in middle layers of a CNN into more semantically interpretable object part features, without sacrificing the CNN's discriminative power. 

The key questions the paper seems to be tackling are:

1) Can we automatically disentangle human-interpretable features like object parts from chaotic middle-layer CNN feature maps without additional supervision? 

2) Can we do this in a way that does not harm the original CNN's discrimination ability, thereby ensuring broader applicability?

3) Can we develop an effective unsupervised method to learn an "explainer" network that disentangles and explains the feature representations learned in a pre-trained "performer" CNN?

In summary, the main focus is on improving the interpretability of CNNs by disentangling middle layer features into semantically meaningful object parts, in an unsupervised manner, without decreasing the CNN's original discrimination power. This is achieved by learning an additional explainer network to explain the representations learned in a performer CNN.
