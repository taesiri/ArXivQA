# [Automating Knowledge Acquisition for Content-Centric Cognitive Agents   Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16378)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adapting large language models (LLMs) for conceptual learning in cognitive agents is challenging. Simply providing the output from previous stages as input to the LLM is not enough - they need more explicit prompting to yield desired outputs. 

- Constructing a single, complex prompt with placeholders does not work well - LLMs struggle with complex, ambiguous instructions. 

Solution:
- Implement a "chain of thought" prompting architecture with a sequence of simpler, more specific prompt templates. This simplifies the task for the LLM.

- The chain includes (1) a base prompt explaining the overall task, (2) a template to generate synonymous multi-word expressions (MWEs), (3) a template to generate sentences containing the MWEs, and (4) a template for semantic validation. 

- Two paths are implemented to generate sentences with MWEs: (1) using the LLM or (2) searching the COCA corpus. Filtering is applied to remove irrelevant LLM-generated sentences.

- Validation involves comparing sentences illustrating the original verb sense to sentences with substituted MWEs. MWEs with different meanings are eliminated.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates an effective prompting architecture for conceptual learning using LLMs, involving prompt sequence simplification and expanding prompts dynamically based on LLM responses.

- Implements and compares two methods for generating sentences for semantic validation of LLM-proposed MWEs - leveraging the creativity of the LLM itself vs. leveraging a text corpus search.

- Shows how semantic validation can be achieved by having the LLM compare sentence sets instead of requiring formal representations.

In summary, the paper introduces techniques to make LLMs more viable for conceptual learning through improved prompting strategies and validation processes.
