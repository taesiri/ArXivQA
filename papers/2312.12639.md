# [Collective Anomaly Perception During Multi-Robot Patrol: Constrained   Interactions Can Promote Accurate Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-robot patrol (MRP) algorithms are effective for minimizing idleness in surveillance tasks. However, their ability to exploit collective anomaly detection and perception has been unexplored.  
- Noisy individual-level detections of anomalies could potentially be compensated at the group level to reach consensus on the likely presence of a threat. This could help prioritize limited security resources.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use 10 existing MRP algorithms without modification but add the secondary objective of reaching consensus regarding anomaly presence via local pairwise communications. 
- Examine the accuracy of the collective perception using a multi-robot F-score, in relation to different levels of noise in the anomaly detection process.
- Analyze the connectivity of the emergent communication networks between robots for different algorithms using algebraic connectivity.

Key Findings:
- MRP algorithms promoting more physical mixing of robots through higher connectivity converge to consensus more quickly.  
- However, when noise increases, more moderate connectivity is preferable to suppress false positives.
- Algorithms like SEBS and CBLS with intermediate connectivity levels obtain the best overall performance in terms of both idleness and multi-robot F-score across different noise levels.
- There is a trade-off between fast, accurate true positive consensus formation and lower numbers of false positives. Users can pick an algorithm based on their priorities.

Main Contributions:
- First examination of collective anomaly perception abilities of common MRP algorithms
- Introduction of a multi-robot F-score to assess accuracy 
- Finding an "optimal" moderate level of connectivity that balances true and false positive consensus
- Guidance to users on algorithm selection based on noise expectations and security priorities
