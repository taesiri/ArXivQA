# [Sheaf Neural Networks with Connection Laplacians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08702)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a novel technique for computing the sheaf Laplacian of a graph in a Sheaf Neural Network model. Specifically, the authors leverage ideas from differential geometry to construct orthogonal maps that optimally align tangent spaces between neighboring data points, relying on the manifold assumption. They adapt this to be graph-aware and show that this technique can achieve competitive results compared to previous methods of learning the sheaf Laplacian, while reducing computational overhead. The key ideas appear to be:- Leveraging differential geometry intuition to compute orthogonal transformations aligning tangent spaces, relying on the manifold assumption- Adapting this technique to be graph-aware, using the valuable edge connection information - Showing this "Connection Sheaf Laplacian" technique achieves promising empirical performance compared to prior Sheaf Neural Network models- Demonstrating the technique reduces computational overhead by avoiding learning the sheaf Laplacian with backpropagationIn summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing a novel way to compute the sheaf Laplacian in a Sheaf Neural Network without learning it, by adapting differential geometry ideas to be graph-aware. This is shown to achieve competitive performance while being more efficient. The connection between ideas from algebraic topology and differential geometry appears to be an interesting research direction as well.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel technique for computing sheaf Laplacians on graphs, building upon recent work on sheaf neural networks (SNNs) and cellular sheaf theory. The key contributions are:- Proposes a new way to construct sheaf Laplacians by computing orthogonal maps between node representations. This is inspired by ideas from Riemannian geometry and the manifold assumption. - Adapts existing techniques for tangent space alignment on point clouds to work directly on graph structures. This is done by using 1-hop graph neighbours instead of epsilon-neighbourhoods. - Evaluates the proposed method (Conn-NSD) on several graph classification benchmarks and shows it achieves competitive performance compared to previous SNN techniques, while also reducing computational overhead.This builds upon recent work showing the benefits of SNNs for addressing issues like heterophily and oversmoothing in graphs. However, previous SNN methods either relied on hand-constructed sheaves or learning the sheaf Laplacian end-to-end via backpropagation. This work explores a different direction by pre-computing the sheaf Laplacian directly from the graph structure and node features. The proposed technique is most related to the neural sheaf diffusion method by Bodnar et al. (2022), which learns the sheaf parametrically. In contrast, this work computes the sheaf in a non-parametric, deterministic way. The orthogonal maps used are also related to the vector diffusion maps idea by Singer and Wu (2012), but adapted to leverage graph structure.Overall, this paper presents an interesting connection between algebraic topology and differential geometry for constructing geometric graph representations. The competitive empirical results on benchmark datasets showcase the potential of the proposed techniques. This helps advance SNN methods by providing an efficient way to build geometric sheaf Laplacians without relying on backpropagation or hand-crafting.
