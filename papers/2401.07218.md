# [Self-supervised Event-based Monocular Depth Estimation using Cross-modal   Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Monocular depth estimation from events captured by event cameras has advantages over using conventional cameras in scenarios with high-speed motions and challenging lighting. However, existing methods rely on expensive depth annotations. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework called EMoDepth that utilizes free intensity frames aligned with events rather than depth labels for supervision. Specifically, it enforces cross-modal consistency between predicted depth maps from events and view synthesis from intensity frames.

Contributions:
1) A self-supervised framework for monocular depth learning that only requires events and aligned intensity frames, removing the need for costly depth annotations.

2) A multi-scale skip-connection network architecture that effectively fuses features for accurate depth estimation while maintaining high inference speed using only events.

3) State-of-the-art performance on MVSEC and DSEC datasets compared to existing supervised event-based and unsupervised frame-based approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed cross-modal consistency and network design.

In summary, this paper presents a self-supervised event-based monocular depth estimation method called EMoDepth that achieves leading performance without expensive labeling. It trains using cross-modal consistency and a multi-scale network tailored for events.
