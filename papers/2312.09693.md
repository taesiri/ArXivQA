# [Prompting Large Language Models for Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09693)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Topic modeling is an important technique for uncovering latent thematic structures in text, but has limitations: struggles with short texts lacking word co-occurrence, focuses on token semantics rather than sentence semantics, requires tedious hyperparameter tuning.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes PromptTopic, a novel prompt-based topic modeling approach leveraging large language models (LLMs). It extracts topics at the sentence level from documents, aggregates and condenses them into a predefined number of coherent topics.  

Key Stages:
1) Topic Generation: Craft prompts for LLMs to generate a set of topics from each document sentence.
2) Topic Collapse: Condense the large set of granular topics into a more coherent condensed set using prompt-based matching or word similarity matching.
3) Topic Representation: Determine the most representative words for each final topic using class-based TF-IDF and LLM filtering.

Main Contributions:
1) First topic modeling technique utilizing the advanced language understanding of LLMs via prompts.
2) Comprehensive experiments on 3 datasets demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines.
3) Qualitative analysis shows the model's ability to uncover more meaningful and coherent topics compared to existing methods.  

Key Benefits:
- Incorporates both token and sentence level semantics for holistic analysis.
- Eliminates tedious hyperparameter tuning via prompt engineering. 
- Works well even for short texts by leveraging LLM knowledge.
- Flexible technique applicable using various LLMs.

Overall, PromptTopic moves topic modeling forward by harnessing recent advances in LLMs for more robust and coherent topic extraction from texts.
