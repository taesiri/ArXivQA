# [Interactive Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization of Software   Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Software architects need to evaluate different architectural alternatives during design to ensure quality criteria are met. However, some criteria are qualitative and hard to quantify numerically, relying more on the architect's expertise.  
- Integrating the architect's subjective judgment into the search process for finding optimal software architectures poses challenges, especially considering the multi-objective nature of the problem.

Proposed Solution:
- An interactive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (iMOEA) is proposed to discover software architectures, combining quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (architectural preferences) criteria.  
- Architectural preferences allow the architect to indicate positive and negative opinions on candidate solutions to guide the search. These are mapped to numerical functions that reward/penalize solutions meeting the preferences.
- Both metric values and architectural preferences are combined into a single weighted fitness function to evaluate solutions.

Main Contributions:
- A mechanism to integrate the architect's qualitative feedback into the multi-objective search process through architectural preferences.
- Architects can provide both positive and negative opinions on solutions to discern between promising and poor candidates.
- Balancing between metric-based evaluation and subjective preferences to reflect the architect's expectations, rather than just finding Pareto optimal solutions.
- Empirical study with 9 participants validates the approach - architects were able to guide the search towards solutions of interest, often requiring only minor modifications to match human-designed architectures.
- Analysis shows the approach can achieve "human-looking" solutions better than just using metrics, by leveraging the architect's abilities to identify core functionalities.

In summary, the paper presents an interactive approach that puts the software architect in the loop to leverage their expertise in guiding multi-objective search for discovering architectures. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments are combined for evaluation. Experiments confirm the method can effectively adapt the search per the architect's preferences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an interactive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to support software engineers in the discovery of component-based software architectures by integrating quantitative software metrics and qualitative human preferences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an interactive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to support software engineers in the discovery of component-based software architectures. Specifically, the paper:

1) Combines quantitative (software metrics) and qualitative (architectural preferences from the engineer) criteria to evaluate candidate architectural solutions. This allows the algorithm to balance objective measures with the subjective preferences of the engineer.

2) Defines several architectural preferences that the engineer can specify to guide the search, including best/worst components, best/worst interfaces, number of components, metric ranges, and aspiration levels. These preferences are mapped to numeric functions that measure the degree of achievement.

3) Conducts an empirical study with 9 participants to assess the performance, usefulness, and intuitiveness of the approach on a real-world system. Results show the algorithm is competitive compared to NSGA-II in terms of quality indicators, while also adapting the search according to the engineer's preferences.

In summary, the key contribution is an interactive evolutionary approach that allows software engineers to actively participate in the optimization process by expressing qualitative preferences, leading to architectures better aligned with their expectations.

- Architectural preferences
- Intra-modular Coupling Density (ICD)
- External Relations Penalty (ERP) 
- Groups/Components Ratio (GCR)

- Spacing (S)
- Interactive Territory Defining Evolutionary Algorithm (iTDEA)

The paper proposes an interactive multi-objective evolutionary approach to support the discovery of component-based software architectures. It integrates qualitative judgments from a software engineer (architectural preferences) with quantitative evaluation criteria (software metrics like ICD, ERP, GCR) to guide the search process. The approach is validated by comparing against NSGA-II on performance indicators like HV and S, as well as through an empirical study with real users. Overall, the key focus is on interactive and multi-objective optimization for search-based software design tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the interactive evolutionary approach for discovering software architectures proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions combining quantitative (software metrics) and qualitative (architectural preferences) criteria for evaluating candidate architectures. What were some of the key considerations and challenges in designing an evaluation function that balances objective and subjective assessments? How is the relative importance of each controlled?

2. Architectural preferences like "best component" and "number of components" seem to focus on phenotypic aspects of solutions. Could you envision additional preference types that provide insights into genotypic or other intrinsic characteristics? What might be some examples and how could they guide the search?

3. The interaction protocol involves occasional algorithm stops to obtain user feedback. What factors influenced the design of this interaction scheme, especially regarding the frequency and timing of interactions? How were considerations like user fatigue accounted for? 

4. The paper mentions the uncertainty inherent when incorporating human judgments and preferences. What mechanisms does the approach use to control inconsistency in user opinions over the course of multiple interactions? How are conflicting preferences reconciled?

5. Repository update involves an adapted version of the territory defining mechanism from iTDEA. What modifications were made and why? How does the notion of solution "dominance" differ in this interactive context compared to traditional Pareto approaches?

6. What considerations were made regarding the visualization of architectural solutions and models to users? What architectural perspectives or views align best with the preference assessments? What challenges exist in presenting complete specifications?

7. The validation study involved 9 participants of varying backgrounds. What further experiments could provide additional insights into the method's applicability and efficacy across user profiles? What data collection could facilitate better understanding of usage modes?

8. The paper identifies several avenues for future enhancement based on user feedback. Which of these extensions seem most impactful in terms of improved interaction or search performance? What challenges might they impose?

9. The approach targets discovery of component-based software architectures from UML class models. How well might the techniques generalize to architectures for other system types? What adaptations would be required?

10. The evaluation relies considerably on subjective user preferences for architectural properties. Could you foresee applications in other creative domains that require extensive human judgment (e.g. engineering design, process optimization)? How might the interactions differ?
