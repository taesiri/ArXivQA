# [CVT-xRF: Contrastive In-Voxel Transformer for 3D Consistent Radiance   Fields from Sparse Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can synthesize high-quality novel views of a scene when trained on dense multi-view images. However, their performance significantly degrades when trained on sparse input views due to insufficient supervision. This causes ambiguities and inconsistencies in the learned 3D radiance field, leading to artifacts and failures in rendered novel views. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel approach called Contrastive In-Voxel Transformer (CVT) to explicitly model and enforce 3D spatial field consistency in order to improve NeRF training with sparse inputs. The key ideas are:

(1) Voxel-based ray sampling - Rays are sampled to intersect voxels to ensure the points share similar radiance within voxels. 

(2) Local implicit constraint - An in-voxel Transformer takes surrounding points and ray points in a voxel as input to implicitly model their radiance correlation and predict radiance of ray points.

(3) Global explicit constraint - A voxel contrastive loss enforces similarity of features from points within voxels versus across voxels.

Together, these components implement both local and global 3D spatial field consistency in a NeRF.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes first approach to explicitly model 3D spatial field consistency to address NeRF degradation with sparse inputs, unlike prior 2D consistency methods.

- Presents flexible CVT structure to achieve this with three main components - voxel sampling, transformer-based local implicit constraint, and voxel contrastive loss.

- Achieves significant gains over strong NeRF baselines like mip-NeRF, BARF and state-of-the-art SPARF on DTU and Synthetic datasets, demonstrating generalizability. 

- Provides both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization of improved novel view synthesis and 3D radiance field consistency.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions towards improving NeRF scene modeling and novel view synthesis from sparse multi-view supervision through a new perspective of 3D spatial field consistency.
