# [Bytes are All You Need: End-to-End Multilingual Speech Recognition and   Synthesis with Bytes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09021)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether using Unicode bytes to represent text can improve multilingual end-to-end speech recognition and synthesis compared to using graphemes. Specifically, the key hypotheses tested in this paper are:- Using bytes instead of graphemes as output units can improve monolingual end-to-end speech recognition for languages with large grapheme vocabularies (e.g. Japanese, Korean).- A multilingual byte-based end-to-end model can outperform individual monolingual models by sharing representations across languages. - A byte-based end-to-end model can handle code-switching speech better than grapheme models.- A multilingual byte-based text-to-speech model can match the performance of monolingual grapheme models.So in summary, the central research question is whether bytes are a better text representation than graphemes for multilingual end-to-end speech processing. The key hypotheses test this for both speech recognition and synthesis tasks.
