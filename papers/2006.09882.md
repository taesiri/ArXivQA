# [Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features by Contrasting Cluster   Assignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be:

Unsupervised image representations can achieve performance competitive with supervised pretraining by using a contrastive learning approach that enforces consistency between cluster assignments for different augmentations of the same image, rather than directly comparing image features as in standard contrastive learning.

The key claims being made are:

1) A "swapped prediction" approach where cluster assignments are predicted between views of the same image can serve as an effective alternative to direct feature comparison for contrastive learning. 

2) This method can scale to large datasets since it does not require storing a large memory bank of features or using a momentum encoder.

3) A "multi-crop" augmentation strategy that uses a mix of views at different resolutions improves performance without increasing compute/memory requirements. 

4) Combining the swapped prediction loss and multi-crop augmentation allows their method (SwAV) to surpass supervised pretraining on several transfer learning benchmarks, a first for an unsupervised method.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is around whether their proposed swapped prediction and multi-crop techniques can push unsupervised contrastive learning to exceed supervised pretraining, which the results seem to validate.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an online clustering method called SwAV (Swapping Assignments between Views) for self-supervised visual representation learning. The key idea is to enforce consistency between cluster assignments predicted from different augmented views of the same image, instead of directly comparing image features as in contrastive learning.

2. Introducing a "multi-crop" data augmentation strategy that uses a mix of crops at different resolutions to increase the number of views of an image without increasing compute/memory costs. 

3. Showing that SwAV improves over prior contrastive and clustering methods, achieving 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using a ResNet-50, which is state-of-the-art for self-supervised methods using a standard ResNet-50.

4. Demonstrating that features learned by SwAV transfer very well to other downstream tasks, outperforming a supervised ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet on several transfer learning benchmarks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that enforcing consistency between cluster assignments from different views can be an effective alternative to contrasting image features directly for self-supervised learning. The multi-crop strategy further improves results. Together, SwAV achieves new state-of-the-art transfer performance for a self-supervised method.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes SwAV, an online clustering-based method for self-supervised visual representation learning. The key idea is to enforce consistency between cluster assignments obtained for different augmented views of the same image, instead of explicitly comparing features like contrastive methods. Specifically, the method computes a code for one view by matching it to a set of trainable prototypes, and tries to predict this code from another view of the same image. This allows contrasting between views without direct feature comparison. 

The authors also introduce a multi-crop augmentation strategy that uses a mix of crops at different resolutions. This increases the number of views for free and is shown to consistently improve performance across methods.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new self-supervised learning method called SwAV (Swapping Assignments between Views) for learning visual features without labels. The key ideas are: 1) Using online clustering to group similar images together and enforce consistency between cluster assignments for different augmented views of the same image. This avoids having to do explicit feature comparisons like in contrastive learning. 2) Introducing a "multi-crop" data augmentation strategy that uses a mix of views at different resolutions to increase the number of views without increasing compute/memory costs. 

The method works by computing cluster assignments or "codes" for each augmented view of an image using a set of trainable prototypes. It then solves a "swapped prediction" problem where the code computed from one view is predicted using the other view's features. This enforces consistency between views. The online clustering allows scaling to large datasets. Multi-crop augmentation is shown to improve performance of SwAV and other methods like SimCLR. Experiments show SwAV achieves 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a ResNet-50, outperforming supervised pretraining on several transfer tasks.

The paper proposes an online clustering approach for self-supervised visual representation learning called SwAV (Swapping Assignments between Views). The key idea is to enforce consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmented views of the same image, instead of directly comparing image features as in contrastive learning. Specifically, given two augmented views of an image, features are extracted and assigned to a set of trainable prototype vectors using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. This produces "codes" for each view. Then, a swapped prediction loss is computed that predicts the code of one view using the representation of the other view, and vice versa. The prototypes and image encoder are jointly optimized to minimize this loss. This allows contrasting views without relying on many negative pairs. The prototypes are updated online over batches, enabling scaling. Additionally, a multi-crop augmentation strategy is proposed to increase the number of views without much overhead. Experiments show SwAV achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised performance on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks.

The paper proposes SwAV, a new self-supervised learning method for visual representation learning. SwAV is based on online clustering of image features extracted from different augmentations or "views" of the same image. Specifically, SwAV enforces consistency between cluster assignment predictions for different views of the same image, instead of directly comparing the image features as in contrastive learning approaches. This is done by predicting the cluster assignment ("code") of one view based on the feature representation of another view of the same image in a "swapped" prediction framework. The cluster assignment is obtained through a Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm that maps features to a set of trainable prototype vectors. The prototypes and image encoder network are learned end-to-end by minimizing the loss from the swapped prediction problem. This allows SwAV to learn useful image representations in an online manner that scales to large datasets. SwAV does not require a memory bank or momentum encoder like other contrastive self-supervised methods. In addition, SwAV uses a multi-crop augmentation strategy with crops of different resolutions to increase the number of views without added compute/memory cost. Experiments show SwAV achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised performance on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks.
