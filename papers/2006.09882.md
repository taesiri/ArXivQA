# [Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features by Contrasting Cluster   Assignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be:Unsupervised image representations can achieve performance competitive with supervised pretraining by using a contrastive learning approach that enforces consistency between cluster assignments for different augmentations of the same image, rather than directly comparing image features as in standard contrastive learning.The key claims being made are:1) A "swapped prediction" approach where cluster assignments are predicted between views of the same image can serve as an effective alternative to direct feature comparison for contrastive learning. 2) This method can scale to large datasets since it does not require storing a large memory bank of features or using a momentum encoder.3) A "multi-crop" augmentation strategy that uses a mix of views at different resolutions improves performance without increasing compute/memory requirements. 4) Combining the swapped prediction loss and multi-crop augmentation allows their method (SwAV) to surpass supervised pretraining on several transfer learning benchmarks, a first for an unsupervised method.So in summary, the central hypothesis is around whether their proposed swapped prediction and multi-crop techniques can push unsupervised contrastive learning to exceed supervised pretraining, which the results seem to validate.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing an online clustering method called SwAV (Swapping Assignments between Views) for self-supervised visual representation learning. The key idea is to enforce consistency between cluster assignments predicted from different augmented views of the same image, instead of directly comparing image features as in contrastive learning.2. Introducing a "multi-crop" data augmentation strategy that uses a mix of crops at different resolutions to increase the number of views of an image without increasing compute/memory costs. 3. Showing that SwAV improves over prior contrastive and clustering methods, achieving 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using a ResNet-50, which is state-of-the-art for self-supervised methods using a standard ResNet-50.4. Demonstrating that features learned by SwAV transfer very well to other downstream tasks, outperforming a supervised ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet on several transfer learning benchmarks.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that enforcing consistency between cluster assignments from different views can be an effective alternative to contrasting image features directly for self-supervised learning. The multi-crop strategy further improves results. Together, SwAV achieves new state-of-the-art transfer performance for a self-supervised method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes SwAV, a new self-supervised learning method for visual representation learning. The main contributions are:1. An online clustering loss that enforces consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations of the same image. This avoids having to do explicit pairwise feature comparisons like in contrastive learning.2. A "multi-crop" data augmentation strategy that uses a mix of views at different resolutions. This increases the number of views without increasing memory/compute requirements. 3. Combining the online clustering loss and multi-crop augmentation, SwAV achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet linear classification (75.3% top-1) and outperforms supervised pretraining on multiple transfer tasks.4. The method works well with both large and small batch sizes, without needing a large memory bank or momentum encoder like some prior contrastive learning methods.So in summary, the main contribution is presenting a way to do self-supervised learning that is scalable, computationally efficient, and achieves excellent performance by enforcing consistency between cluster assignments of different views of an image. The multi-crop augmentation further improves results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting an unsupervised learning method called SwAV (Swapping Assignments between Views) for learning visual features. The key ideas are:- It is an online clustering-based method that enforces consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmented views of the same image, instead of directly comparing image features like in contrastive learning. - It uses a "swapped prediction" mechanism where the cluster assignment of one view is predicted from the representation of another view of the same image.- It avoids the need for a large memory bank or momentum encoder like in other contrastive learning methods.- It introduces a "multi-crop" data augmentation strategy that uses a mix of views with different resolutions to increase the number of views without increasing compute/memory costs.- Experiments show it achieves 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a ResNet-50, outperforming previous self-supervised methods. It also exceeds supervised pretraining on several transfer learning tasks.So in summary, the main contribution is presenting SwAV, a scalable online clustering approach for self-supervised learning that achieves new state-of-the-art results by clustering and swapping assignments between multiple views of images. The multi-crop augmentation also consistently improves other self-supervised methods.
