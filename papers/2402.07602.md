# [DART: A Compact Platform For Autonomous Driving Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07602)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Small-scale autonomous driving research platforms provide a cost-effective way to test navigation and control algorithms before deploying on full-scale vehicles. However, existing platforms have drawbacks like high costs, lack of reproducibility due to custom parts, and versatility limitations. This hinders their widespread adoption and reproducibility of research results.

Proposed Solution - DART Platform:  
The paper proposes DART (Delft's Autonomous-driving Robotic Testbed), an affordable small-scale car-like robot designed for autonomous driving research. DART is built by augmenting an off-the-shelf Jetracer kit with sensors and hardware needed for navigation. It features very few custom parts, making it easily reproducible at around â‚¬700. 

Key Contributions:

1. Accessibility: Low cost platform for labs with limited budgets. Easily reproducible due to reliance on off-the-shelf parts.

2. System Identification: Details a model identification procedure tailored for small-scale cars to obtain reliable kinematic and dynamic bicycle models needed for control tasks. Models and data provided in GitHub repo.  

3. Versatility: Augmented sensor suite allows testing algorithms for localization, mapping, path planning, and single/multi-agent vehicle control. Several use cases demonstrated including intersection crossing, persistent monitoring, platooning, contour following, etc.

4. Reproducibility: Hardware details, build instructions, identification code, low-level controllers and a simulation environment hosted on GitHub to replicate DART and research results.

In summary, DART enables affordable and reproducible autonomous driving research by proposing an accessible small-scale robotic platform with rigorous system identification and documentation to test a wide variety of navigation algorithms.
