# [Augmented Sliced Wasserstein Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08812)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be:How to develop a flexible, data-adaptive distance metric between probability distributions that improves upon limitations of existing methods like the sliced Wasserstein distance? The paper proposes a new distance called the "augmented sliced Wasserstein distance" (ASWD) to address this question. The key ideas are:- Map samples to higher-dimensional hypersurfaces parameterized by neural networks before computing the sliced Wasserstein distance. This enables more flexible nonlinear projections compared to linear projections used in existing sliced Wasserstein methods. - Optimize the hypersurfaces used for projection by maximizing the resulting distance between distributions. This makes the metric data-adaptive.- Use an injective architecture for the neural networks to guarantee that the ASWD satisfies the properties of a mathematical metric. - Demonstrate superior performance over existing sliced Wasserstein variants on synthetic data and generative modeling tasks.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that developing a flexible, optimized, nonlinear version of sliced Wasserstein distances can improve performance and overcome limitations of existing approaches. The ASWD method is proposed to test this hypothesis.
