# [SoK: Challenges and Opportunities in Federated Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02437)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the emerging field of Federated Unlearning (FU), which involves removing specific data or models from federated learning systems upon request. FU enables users to exercise privacy rights like the "right to be forgotten" in the context of federated learning. 

The paper first highlights the unique challenges of performing unlearning in a federated setting compared to traditional centralized machine learning. These include the interactive and iterative nature of federated learning, isolation of information across clients, non-IID (non-identically distributed) data, and stochasticity in client selection. These complexities necessitate tailored solutions for FU.

The paper then deeply analyzes existing FU literature across multiple dimensions:

- Who initiates unlearning (server, target clients, remaining clients) and their accessible knowledge 
- Assumptions on data distribution and simulation of non-IID data
- Dataset usage statistics (mostly simple image datasets currently)
- Model architectures (CNNs predominant currently) 
- Aggregation methods (mostly simple FedAvg currently)
- Research implications considered (efficacy, fidelity and efficiency predominantly)  

Additionally, the paper categorizes FU techniques for influence removal and performance recovery. Influence removal techniques include using historical information, gradient manipulation, loss function approximation, knowledge distillation, multi-task learning, reverse training, and clustering. Performance recovery methods include post-training, fine-tuning, gradient manipulation, regularization, and knowledge distillation. 

The paper also compares evaluation metrics used for efficacy, fidelity and efficiency, highlighting the current lack of standardized benchmark metrics. It notes limitations of simple backdoor attacks for evaluations.

Finally, the paper provides valuable insights and suggestions for advancing FU research:

- Need for testing FU methods on real-world non-IID data distributions
- Extending FU applications beyond vision tasks and simple datasets 
- Incorporating advanced aggregation methods from federated learning 
- Addressing additional privacy vulnerabilities introduced by FU
- Developing standardized evaluation benchmarks for quantitative comparisons

In summary, this is a very comprehensive survey offering key insights into the state of federated unlearning research and providing thoughtful guidance for advancing work in this critical area at the intersection of privacy and machine learning.
