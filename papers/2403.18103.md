## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents an educational tutorial on diffusion models for generative image modeling. Diffusion models are an emerging class of generative models that can produce high-quality images by estimating the data distribution through an iterative denoising process. 

The paper starts by providing background on variational autoencoders (VAEs) as a baseline generative model. It then introduces three main perspectives for deriving diffusion models:

1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs): These represent the incremental diffusion process as a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to data samples. The models are trained to denoise the noisy samples.

2. Score Matching Langevin Dynamics (SMLD): These derive diffusion using stochastic differential equations and score matching techniques. Score matching trains models to predict the gradient or score of the data distribution. 

3. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs): These formulate the diffusion models, including DDPM and SMLD, as solutions to forward and reverse-time SDEs. Solving or simulating these SDEs produces samples from the desired distribution.

For each perspective, the paper clearly explains how to derive the diffusion modeling iterations and objectives. It discusses model training to perform iterative denoising as well as sampling through reverse diffusion. There is also significant discussion on relating these perspectives theoretically.

Overall, the paper provides an excellent high-level tutorial on the foundations of diffusion models for image synthesis. It unifies the different theoretical views that have been taken to developing these models. The explanations aim to build intuition rather than provide full technical details. This makes the tutorial very accessible for newcomers seeking to understand this rapidly evolving field.
