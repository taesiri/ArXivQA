# [A Closed-Loop Multi-perspective Visual Servoing Approach with   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15809)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional visual servoing methods have limitations in serving between scenes from multiple perspectives, which humans can easily do using only visual information. Specifically, significant differences between image features of the initial and target states make feature matching challenging. Meanwhile, robot constraints like self-collisions and singularities need to be considered. Thus, multi-perspective visual servoing in complex industrial scenarios remains difficult due to perceptual limitations and robot constraints.

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents a novel closed-loop multi-perspective visual servoing framework using reinforcement learning (RL) to estimate optimal robot actions from latent space representations of visual states. An autoencoder network extracts latent features from depth images capturing the current and desired camera perspectives. A robotic policy network then takes these latent features and other robot state information as input to output velocity controls for servoing the robot arm. 

The policy network is based on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. To improve training efficiency, hindsight experience replay (HER), learning from demonstration, and additional exploration are utilized. The reward function considers task errors in translation, rotation and image difference, as well as robot constraints like singularities and collisions.

Main Contributions:
1) A closed-loop multi-perspective visual servoing framework using RL to control robots from latent visual state representations
2) Improved training efficiency of the RL policy using HER, demonstration learning and exploration
3) A potential-based reward function considering task and robot constraints

Experiments in simulation show the framework can successfully learn policies to servo the robot arm from varying perspectives to achieve a target goal image. The method achieves 97% success rate in testing, significantly outperforming traditional direct visual servoing.
