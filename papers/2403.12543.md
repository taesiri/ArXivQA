# [HCPM: Hierarchical Candidates Pruning for Efficient Detector-Free   Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12543)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Detector-free image matching methods like LoFTR achieve high accuracy but suffer from substantial computational demands due to the quadratic complexity of transformer architectures. This trade-off between accuracy and efficiency needs to be addressed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called Hierarchical Candidates Pruning for Efficient Detector-Free Matching (HCPM) that employs a hierarchical pruning strategy to reduce computational complexity while retaining the benefits of dense matches from detector-free methods.

- The hierarchical pruning has two stages:
   1) Self-pruning: Uses a lightweight MLP and sigmoid activation to score each coarse-level candidate based on informativeness. Then selects the top-k most informative candidates.
   2) Interactive-pruning: Employs multiple transformer self-cross attention layers. After each layer, a Differentiable Interactive Candidate Selection (DICS) module determines candidates to prune based on co-visibility. Finally uses a Gumbel softmax to refine the candidates.

- Supervises pruning using depth signals for self-pruning and co-visible areas for interactive pruning. Overall matching loss is a weighted combination of pruning loss and standard LoFTR matching loss.   

Main Contributions:
- First work to accelerate detector-free image matching via a hierarchical pruning strategy adapted from techniques in segmentation/detection.
- Provides a differentiable selection mechanism using co-visibility to supervise pruning.
- Achieves nearly 50% speedup over LoFTR while maintaining accuracy, highlighting efficiency for applications like pose estimation and visual localization.
- Demonstrates insights into balancing performance and efficiency via ablations on factors like pruning ratios.

In summary, the paper makes detector-free image matching much more efficient via a novel hierarchical pruning approach, while retaining the accuracy and robustness benefits of the detector-free paradigm.
