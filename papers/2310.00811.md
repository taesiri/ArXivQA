# [Sparse Backpropagation for MoE Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00811)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we train Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models effectively when the routing function used for sparse computation is non-differentiable?

The key points are:

- MoE models use a discrete routing function to assign different parts of the model selectively to each input. This allows for sparse computation and exceptional scalability. 

- However, the routing function is non-differentiable, which poses challenges for training MoE models via backpropagation. Existing methods like straight-through estimators require dense computation, undermining the purpose of sparsity.

- Typical MoE training neglects certain gradient terms to allow sparse routing, but this may result in suboptimal training.

- This paper proposes SparseMixer, which provides reliable gradient approximations for MoE routing that maintain sparsity. It is inspired by numerical ODE methods.

- Experiments on machine translation and pre-training tasks show SparseMixer accelerates training convergence and improves performance compared to prior MoE training approaches.

So in summary, the core research problem is providing an effective way to train MoE models that maintains the sparsity benefits of routing, which prior methods failed to achieve. SparseMixer proposes a solution based on insights from numerical analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Introducing SparseMixer, a novel method to bridge the gap between sparse expert routing in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and dense backpropagation required for training neural networks. 

- Drawing inspiration from numerical ODE solvers, SparseMixer provides reliable gradient approximations for expert routing in MoE models, without needing to activate all experts. This maintains the computational sparsity and efficiency of MoE models.

- Specifically, SparseMixer leverages the midpoint method, a second-order ODE solver, to get precise gradient estimates with negligible computational overhead. 

- Applying SparseMixer to Switch Transformer architecture for machine translation and language model pretraining. Results show SparseMixer speeds up training convergence by up to 2x and allows MoE models to consistently outperform dense models after training.

- Analysis providing intuitions about why existing straight-through gradient estimators are incompatible with sparse MoE models. Comparisons to ablations validate the importance of SparseMixer's designs.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of SparseMixer to enable precise and sparse gradients for training MoE models, which improves convergence and performance over prior MoE training techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper: The paper proposes SparseMixer, a novel gradient estimation method that enables reliable backpropagation and training of sparsely activated Mixture-of-Expert models without sacrificing scalability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of mixture-of-experts and sparse gradient estimation:

- The paper introduces a novel method called SparseMixer for gradient estimation in mixture-of-expert (MoE) models. Most prior work on MoE models has strategically neglected certain gradient terms for scalability, sacrificing training signal. SparseMixer approximates those terms to provide more reliable gradient signals without compromising scalability. This is a novel approach compared to typical MoE training.

- The paper grounds SparseMixer in numerical methods for ODEs, bringing a new perspective compared to typical gradient approximation methods like straight-through estimation. Leveraging the mid-point method from ODE solvers allows SparseMixer to match the gradient to second order without computing costly second derivatives.

- Experiments apply SparseMixer to the Switch Transformer architecture for machine translation and language model pretraining. Results demonstrate accelerated training convergence and improved generalization compared to baseline Switch Transformers. This provides empirical evidence that SparseMixer better trains the routing function in MoE models.

- The paper formally establishes connections between SparseMixer and prior gradient estimators like Straight-Through,analyzing why those cannot be directly applied in sparse MoE settings. This provides theoretical grounding and motivation for the SparseMixer design.

- Overall, SparseMixer appears to be the first method that reconciles sparse expert routing in MoE models with reliable gradient approximation for end-to-end training. The results advance the state-of-the-art in training large yet sparse MoE models.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel perspective and method for sparse gradient estimation in MoE models, supported by formal analysis and empirical results. This compares favorably over prior work that either sacrifices gradient signal or density for scalability.
