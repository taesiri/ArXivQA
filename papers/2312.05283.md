# [Nuvo: Neural UV Mapping for Unruly 3D Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05283)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
Existing UV mapping algorithms are designed to work with well-behaved, clean meshes and fail to produce usable mappings when applied to complex geometry representations produced by recent 3D reconstruction and generation techniques like neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Methods like xatlas and OptCuts produce heavily fragmented texture atlases on meshes extracted from NeRFs that are unusable for appearance editing. NeuTex can map NeRF geometries but results in significant distortion. There is a need for a UV mapping method that works for complex geometry from neural 3D representations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents Nuvo, a novel UV mapping technique that represents the mapping as a neural field instead of tying it to mesh vertices. Nuvo uses a set of MLPs to map points between 3D surface space and 2D texture space. One MLP assigns surface points to charts, n MLPs map points from 3D to 2D texture coords for each chart, and another n MLPs map points from 2D to 3D per chart. Several losses are imposed to encourage bijectivity, utilize all of UV space, minimize atlas fragmentation and distortion, and reproduce surface normals.

Key Contributions:
- First technique to produce editable UV atlases for complex neural 3D geometry without fragmentation or distortion issues faced by prior arts
- Novel chart assignment and coordinate mapping MLP architecture to represent continuous UV mapping fields
- Set of losses to optimize for bijectivity, low distortion, and texture utilization
- Robust handling of surfaces with multiple connected components, holes, bumpy triangles etc. unlike traditional parameterization methods
- Produces superior quality mappings on NeRF geometry compared to NeuTex, xatlas and Blender
- Compatible with any geometry representation that enables sampling visible surface points

In summary, the paper presents a new neural technique called Nuvo that can generate high-quality UV mappings with low distortion and fragmentation for complex neural 3D geometry representations. This enables appearance editing for neural 3D content.
