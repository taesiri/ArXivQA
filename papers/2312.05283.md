# [Nuvo: Neural UV Mapping for Unruly 3D Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05283)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a new method called Nuvo for generating high-quality UV texture mappings for complex 3D models produced by neural reconstruction and generation techniques. Existing UV mapping methods are designed for well-behaved meshes and struggle with the non-smooth geometry from neural 3D representations. Nuvo represents the UV mapping as a continuous function using neural fields instead of mapping vertices on a mesh, allowing it to handle challenging geometry. It optimizes the mapping by minimizing losses that encourage bijectivity, utilize all of UV space, reduce distortion, and prevent chart fragmentation. Experiments demonstrate Nuvo produces editable mappings directly from volume density fields or extracted meshes, even for complex shapes with thousands of components. Comparisons to baselines like xatlas and NeuTex show Nuvo achieves higher editability scores through lower distortion and texture atlas fragmentation. A key advantage is the ability to generate usable UV maps from neural 3D representations that cannot be handled by other methods. The mapping representation also facilitates tasks like differentiable rendering and appearance editing. Limitations include lack of guarantees on global bijectivity or minimal distortion and no interactive user controls. Overall, Nuvo enables high-quality texture mapping for emerging neural 3D content creation paradigms.
