# [Sliced Optimal Partial Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a new distance/similarity measure called "sliced optimal partial transport" (SOPT) that extends optimal partial transport (OPT) to handle high-dimensional distributions. 

2) Developing an efficient algorithm to compute the 1D OPT between empirical distributions in quadratic time complexity.

3) Demonstrating SOPT's benefits on two applications - robust point cloud registration and color adaptation.

More specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of standard optimal transport (OT) distances - namely the requirement of equal mass and sensitivity to outliers/noise. It proposes combining ideas from optimal partial transport (which allows unequal mass) and sliced OT (which exploits 1D solutions) to get a distance that is more robust and can handle high-dimensional data.

The key hypothesis seems to be that this proposed SOPT distance will be more useful for comparing real-world high-dimensional distributions with unequal total mass and outliers, compared to other OT variants. The authors provide empirical validation on synthetic point cloud data and image color adaptation tasks.

In summary, the central research thrust is developing the theory and algorithms for a new robust OT distance (SOPT) and demonstrating its practical benefits over alternative distances.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new algorithm for efficiently computing the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem between two discrete 1D measures. The proposed algorithm has a worst-case quadratic time complexity. 

2. Introduction of the sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) distance, which utilizes 1D slicing to approximate the OPT distance between higher dimensional measures. It is proven that SOPT satisfies the properties of a metric.

3. Demonstration of SOPT for two applications - point cloud registration and color adaptation. For point cloud registration, a SOPT-based iterative closest point algorithm is proposed that is robust to noise. For color adaptation, it is shown that SOPT can avoid some shortcomings compared to standard optimal transport.

In summary, the main contributions are an efficient algorithm for 1D OPT, introduction of the SOPT distance, and demonstration of its usefulness on some applications compared to prior OT and OPT methods. The key novelty is in extending the idea of sliced optimal transport to the optimal partial transport setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for the optimal partial transport problem between one-dimensional measures, introduces the sliced optimal partial transport distance, proves it satisfies metric properties, and demonstrates applications in point cloud registration and color adaptation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in optimal transport and its applications:

- The paper focuses on the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem, which is an active area of research that relaxes the standard optimal transport problem to allow for mass deletion and creation. The paper discusses how OPT relates to other recent work on unbalanced and entropy-regularized optimal transport.

- The main algorithmic contribution is an efficient method for solving 1D empirical OPT problems in quadratic time, improving upon prior work on 1D OPT with cubic complexity. The paper proves correctness and provides complexity analysis.

- Building on this, the paper proposes the novel Sliced Optimal Partial Transport (SOPT) distance in higher dimensions, analogous to sliced optimal transport. Theoretical properties like the metric property are analyzed.

- For applications, the paper shows how SOPT can be used for point cloud registration and color adaptation tasks. The registration application in particular seems quite novel and demonstrates the potential robustness benefits of SOPT over standard optimal transport methods on noisy data.

- The paper is well-written and clearly situated within the OPT literature. The algorithm analysis is thorough. The applications effectively demonstrate the utility of SOPT on real-world tasks.

- Compared to some other recent work in this area, the applications are quite straightforward. There could be room for exploring the benefits of SOPT on more complex problems and datasets in future work.

Overall, this seems like a solid paper advancing the OPT literature, with useful theoretical contributions and practical applications. The SOPT distance and its applications are the most novel parts compared to prior work. More complex experiments would strengthen the empirical contributions. But within its scope, the paper makes effective theoretical and algorithmic contributions around the promising OPT framework.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Theoretical analysis of the accuracy and convergence properties of the proposed sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) algorithm. The authors mention leaving formal proofs of some assumptions made in analyzing the algorithm for future work.

- Further applications of SOPT in machine learning tasks like open set domain adaptation and measuring task similarities in continual/curriculum learning. The authors suggest SOPT could be a good candidate technique for these problems but do not demonstrate applications.

- Optimizing the SOPT algorithm, e.g. for the case when the number of source points is much smaller than target points. The authors provide some suggestions for potential speedups but leave detailed analysis for future work.

- Extensions of the SOPT framework, e.g. to other ground cost functions beyond the Euclidean distance, or replacing linear projections with non-linear ones as in generalized Radon transforms.

- Analysis of the SOPT metric properties, e.g. proving (or disproving) that it satisfies stronger properties like being geodesically convex.

- Applications of the SOPT algorithm for empirical measures to continuous optimal partial transport problems. The authors focus on the discrete case but suggest connections to the continuous setting.

In summary, the main directions are: theoretical analysis, more applications, algorithmic optimization, extensions of the framework, further metric space analysis, and connections to the continuous optimal partial transport theory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT), an efficient algorithm for approximating the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem between two non-negative measures in high dimensions. OPT is a recently proposed extension of optimal transport that allows mass creation/destruction, making it more suitable for comparing unbalanced measures. However, like optimal transport, computing OPT relies on solving a costly linear program. The key idea of SOPT is to reduce the OPT problem in d-dimensions to a tractable 1D version by considering OPT between one-dimensional projections, or slices, of the two measures. The paper proves SOPT satisfies key properties and develops a fast quadratic-time algorithm to solve 1D OPT. Experiments demonstrate the computational and accuracy benefits of SOPT for tasks like point cloud registration and color adaptation. Overall, the paper provides an efficient way to leverage the flexibility of OPT for comparing unbalanced measures in machine learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Sliced Optimal Partial Transport (SOPT) for efficiently computing approximations to the Optimal Partial Transport (OPT) problem. OPT is an extension of the popular Optimal Transport problem that allows for partial matching between two probability measures, instead of requiring a bijection. However, like OT, computing OPT exactly involves solving a linear program which can be computationally prohibitive for large problems. 

To address this, the authors develop an efficient algorithm for computing 1D OPT between sorted measures. They prove its correctness and quadratic worst-case complexity. Then, inspired by sliced OT techniques, they extend this to define a Sliced OPT cost for multi-dimensional measures based on solving many 1D OPT problems along randomly sampled directions. They prove metric properties of SOPT and demonstrate its practical utility on point cloud registration and color adaptation tasks. Comparisons to other algorithms show SOPT's benefits for problems with noise and outliers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient algorithm for calculating the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem between two non-negative measures in one dimension. It then utilizes the idea of sliced optimal transport distances to define a sliced OPT distance in higher dimensions. Specifically, it approximates the sliced OPT distance by sampling random one-dimensional projections, solving the 1D OPT problem for each projection using the proposed efficient algorithm, and averaging the costs. The 1D OPT algorithm is based on solving a sequence of maximum flow problems and has a worst case quadratic time complexity but is often linear in practice. Numerical experiments demonstrate the computational and accuracy benefits of the sliced OPT method for problems like noisy point cloud registration and color adaptation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the limitations of standard optimal transport (OT) and proposing a new method called sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) to overcome them. Some key problems and questions addressed are:

- Standard OT requires the two distributions being compared to have equal total mass. Many practical applications involve comparing distributions with unequal mass, which OT cannot directly handle. 

- OT distances are not robust to outliers and noise. Transporting outliers can be very costly and compromise the accuracy of the OT distance.

- Computing the OT distance involves solving a linear program, which is computationally expensive for large datasets. 

To address these issues, the paper introduces the sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) method. The key ideas and questions addressed are:

- Optimal partial transport (OPT) is proposed as an extension of OT that allows mass destruction and creation, enabling comparison of unequal distributions.

- The paper proposes an efficient quadratic-time algorithm to solve the OPT problem between 1D empirical distributions.

- Sliced OT techniques are leveraged to extend the 1D OPT solver to define a Sliced OPT distance between distributions in higher dimensions.

- Theoretical analysis is provided showing SOPT satisfies metric properties.

- The accuracy and computational benefits of SOPT are demonstrated on applications in point cloud registration and color transfer.

In summary, the key focus is developing SOPT as an extension of OT that is more flexible, robust, and computationally efficient for comparing real-world multidimensional distributions.

- SOPT is also applied to color adaptation between images, avoiding some shortcomings of standard OT methods.

So in summary, the key terms cover the SOPT method itself, the OPT and OT background, and the applications in shape and color transfer.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes efficient algorithms for solving the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem between one-dimensional empirical measures. The authors first show that the OPT plan between sorted empirical measures is induced by a monotonous mapping between the supports. Leveraging this structure and the primal-dual optimality conditions, they develop an algorithm that finds the optimal mapping and dual solutions in quadratic worst-case time. They also adapt the algorithm to the setting where mass destruction in the source is disallowed. Next, the authors propose the sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) distance, which applies their 1D solver to projections of higher-dimensional measures. They prove that SOPT satisfies the properties of a metric. Experimentally, the authors demonstrate the benefits of their proposed algorithms in runtime analyses and apply SOPT to noisy point cloud registration, where they show improved robustness over classical iterative closest point methods. Lastly, they illustrate SOPT for color adaptation between images, where it avoids typical artifacts of balanced optimal transport.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to solve the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem between one-dimensional discrete measures. The authors first show that the optimal plan for empirical OPT can be restricted to a monotonically increasing mapping between the supports. Based on this, they develop a primal-dual algorithm that iteratively constructs this mapping with quadratic worst-case time complexity. The algorithm resolves conflicts arising during construction via a subroutine inspired by the Hungarian method. The authors then propose the sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) distance, which applies their 1D solver to projections of higher-dimensional measures. They prove SOPT satisfies metric properties and can be approximated via Monte Carlo integration. Finally, experiments demonstrate the algorithmic speedups and robustness of SOPT for point cloud registration and color adaptation tasks compared to optimal transport and existing partial transport techniques.
