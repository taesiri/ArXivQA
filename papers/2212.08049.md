# [Sliced Optimal Partial Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a new distance/similarity measure called "sliced optimal partial transport" (SOPT) that extends optimal partial transport (OPT) to handle high-dimensional distributions. 

2) Developing an efficient algorithm to compute the 1D OPT between empirical distributions in quadratic time complexity.

3) Demonstrating SOPT's benefits on two applications - robust point cloud registration and color adaptation.

More specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of standard optimal transport (OT) distances - namely the requirement of equal mass and sensitivity to outliers/noise. It proposes combining ideas from optimal partial transport (which allows unequal mass) and sliced OT (which exploits 1D solutions) to get a distance that is more robust and can handle high-dimensional data.

The key hypothesis seems to be that this proposed SOPT distance will be more useful for comparing real-world high-dimensional distributions with unequal total mass and outliers, compared to other OT variants. The authors provide empirical validation on synthetic point cloud data and image color adaptation tasks.

In summary, the central research thrust is developing the theory and algorithms for a new robust OT distance (SOPT) and demonstrating its practical benefits over alternative distances.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new algorithm for efficiently computing the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem between two discrete 1D measures. The proposed algorithm has a worst-case quadratic time complexity. 

2. Introduction of the sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) distance, which utilizes 1D slicing to approximate the OPT distance between higher dimensional measures. It is proven that SOPT satisfies the properties of a metric.

3. Demonstration of SOPT for two applications - point cloud registration and color adaptation. For point cloud registration, a SOPT-based iterative closest point algorithm is proposed that is robust to noise. For color adaptation, it is shown that SOPT can avoid some shortcomings compared to standard optimal transport.

In summary, the main contributions are an efficient algorithm for 1D OPT, introduction of the SOPT distance, and demonstration of its usefulness on some applications compared to prior OT and OPT methods. The key novelty is in extending the idea of sliced optimal transport to the optimal partial transport setting.
