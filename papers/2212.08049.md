# [Sliced Optimal Partial Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a new distance/similarity measure called "sliced optimal partial transport" (SOPT) that extends optimal partial transport (OPT) to handle high-dimensional distributions. 

2) Developing an efficient algorithm to compute the 1D OPT between empirical distributions in quadratic time complexity.

3) Demonstrating SOPT's benefits on two applications - robust point cloud registration and color adaptation.

More specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of standard optimal transport (OT) distances - namely the requirement of equal mass and sensitivity to outliers/noise. It proposes combining ideas from optimal partial transport (which allows unequal mass) and sliced OT (which exploits 1D solutions) to get a distance that is more robust and can handle high-dimensional data.

The key hypothesis seems to be that this proposed SOPT distance will be more useful for comparing real-world high-dimensional distributions with unequal total mass and outliers, compared to other OT variants. The authors provide empirical validation on synthetic point cloud data and image color adaptation tasks.

In summary, the central research thrust is developing the theory and algorithms for a new robust OT distance (SOPT) and demonstrating its practical benefits over alternative distances.
