# [Sliced Optimal Partial Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a new distance/similarity measure called "sliced optimal partial transport" (SOPT) that extends optimal partial transport (OPT) to handle high-dimensional distributions. 

2) Developing an efficient algorithm to compute the 1D OPT between empirical distributions in quadratic time complexity.

3) Demonstrating SOPT's benefits on two applications - robust point cloud registration and color adaptation.

More specifically, the paper aims to address the limitations of standard optimal transport (OT) distances - namely the requirement of equal mass and sensitivity to outliers/noise. It proposes combining ideas from optimal partial transport (which allows unequal mass) and sliced OT (which exploits 1D solutions) to get a distance that is more robust and can handle high-dimensional data.

The key hypothesis seems to be that this proposed SOPT distance will be more useful for comparing real-world high-dimensional distributions with unequal total mass and outliers, compared to other OT variants. The authors provide empirical validation on synthetic point cloud data and image color adaptation tasks.

In summary, the central research thrust is developing the theory and algorithms for a new robust OT distance (SOPT) and demonstrating its practical benefits over alternative distances.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new algorithm for efficiently computing the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem between two discrete 1D measures. The proposed algorithm has a worst-case quadratic time complexity. 

2. Introduction of the sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) distance, which utilizes 1D slicing to approximate the OPT distance between higher dimensional measures. It is proven that SOPT satisfies the properties of a metric.

3. Demonstration of SOPT for two applications - point cloud registration and color adaptation. For point cloud registration, a SOPT-based iterative closest point algorithm is proposed that is robust to noise. For color adaptation, it is shown that SOPT can avoid some shortcomings compared to standard optimal transport.

In summary, the main contributions are an efficient algorithm for 1D OPT, introduction of the SOPT distance, and demonstration of its usefulness on some applications compared to prior OT and OPT methods. The key novelty is in extending the idea of sliced optimal transport to the optimal partial transport setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for the optimal partial transport problem between one-dimensional measures, introduces the sliced optimal partial transport distance, proves it satisfies metric properties, and demonstrates applications in point cloud registration and color adaptation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in optimal transport and its applications:

- The paper focuses on the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem, which is an active area of research that relaxes the standard optimal transport problem to allow for mass deletion and creation. The paper discusses how OPT relates to other recent work on unbalanced and entropy-regularized optimal transport.

- The main algorithmic contribution is an efficient method for solving 1D empirical OPT problems in quadratic time, improving upon prior work on 1D OPT with cubic complexity. The paper proves correctness and provides complexity analysis.

- Building on this, the paper proposes the novel Sliced Optimal Partial Transport (SOPT) distance in higher dimensions, analogous to sliced optimal transport. Theoretical properties like the metric property are analyzed.

- For applications, the paper shows how SOPT can be used for point cloud registration and color adaptation tasks. The registration application in particular seems quite novel and demonstrates the potential robustness benefits of SOPT over standard optimal transport methods on noisy data.

- The paper is well-written and clearly situated within the OPT literature. The algorithm analysis is thorough. The applications effectively demonstrate the utility of SOPT on real-world tasks.

- Compared to some other recent work in this area, the applications are quite straightforward. There could be room for exploring the benefits of SOPT on more complex problems and datasets in future work.

Overall, this seems like a solid paper advancing the OPT literature, with useful theoretical contributions and practical applications. The SOPT distance and its applications are the most novel parts compared to prior work. More complex experiments would strengthen the empirical contributions. But within its scope, the paper makes effective theoretical and algorithmic contributions around the promising OPT framework.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Theoretical analysis of the accuracy and convergence properties of the proposed sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT) algorithm. The authors mention leaving formal proofs of some assumptions made in analyzing the algorithm for future work.

- Further applications of SOPT in machine learning tasks like open set domain adaptation and measuring task similarities in continual/curriculum learning. The authors suggest SOPT could be a good candidate technique for these problems but do not demonstrate applications.

- Optimizing the SOPT algorithm, e.g. for the case when the number of source points is much smaller than target points. The authors provide some suggestions for potential speedups but leave detailed analysis for future work.

- Extensions of the SOPT framework, e.g. to other ground cost functions beyond the Euclidean distance, or replacing linear projections with non-linear ones as in generalized Radon transforms.

- Analysis of the SOPT metric properties, e.g. proving (or disproving) that it satisfies stronger properties like being geodesically convex.

- Applications of the SOPT algorithm for empirical measures to continuous optimal partial transport problems. The authors focus on the discrete case but suggest connections to the continuous setting.

In summary, the main directions are: theoretical analysis, more applications, algorithmic optimization, extensions of the framework, further metric space analysis, and connections to the continuous optimal partial transport theory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes sliced optimal partial transport (SOPT), an efficient algorithm for approximating the optimal partial transport (OPT) problem between two non-negative measures in high dimensions. OPT is a recently proposed extension of optimal transport that allows mass creation/destruction, making it more suitable for comparing unbalanced measures. However, like optimal transport, computing OPT relies on solving a costly linear program. The key idea of SOPT is to reduce the OPT problem in d-dimensions to a tractable 1D version by considering OPT between one-dimensional projections, or slices, of the two measures. The paper proves SOPT satisfies key properties and develops a fast quadratic-time algorithm to solve 1D OPT. Experiments demonstrate the computational and accuracy benefits of SOPT for tasks like point cloud registration and color adaptation. Overall, the paper provides an efficient way to leverage the flexibility of OPT for comparing unbalanced measures in machine learning.
