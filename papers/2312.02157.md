# [Mesh-Guided Neural Implicit Field Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02157)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for editing neural implicit fields using an explicitly extracted colored mesh as guidance. It first introduces a differentiable marching tetrahedra technique to extract a triangle mesh surface from the density field of a pre-trained neural radiance field model. Building on this, the authors further design a differentiable renderer to assign colors to the mesh vertices by approximating the radiance integral near the surface. With this differentiable colored mesh representation linking the explicit mesh and implicit scene representation, the authors are able to propagate gradients from the edited mesh back to the neural radiance and density fields, achieving intuitive control over both geometry and appearance editing. To support fine-grained editing, the method constructs an octree structure based on the mesh to focus computations on regions of interest. Through minimizing Chamfer distance and color difference losses between the user-edited target mesh and optimized proxy mesh, the neural implicit functions can be updated to match user modifications in geometry and color. Experiments demonstrate the capability of this approach in facilitating diverse edits like adding/removing components, deforming surface regions, and refining texture details.
