# [Mesh-Guided Neural Implicit Field Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02157)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for editing neural implicit fields using an explicitly extracted colored mesh as guidance. It first introduces a differentiable marching tetrahedra technique to extract a triangle mesh surface from the density field of a pre-trained neural radiance field model. Building on this, the authors further design a differentiable renderer to assign colors to the mesh vertices by approximating the radiance integral near the surface. With this differentiable colored mesh representation linking the explicit mesh and implicit scene representation, the authors are able to propagate gradients from the edited mesh back to the neural radiance and density fields, achieving intuitive control over both geometry and appearance editing. To support fine-grained editing, the method constructs an octree structure based on the mesh to focus computations on regions of interest. Through minimizing Chamfer distance and color difference losses between the user-edited target mesh and optimized proxy mesh, the neural implicit functions can be updated to match user modifications in geometry and color. Experiments demonstrate the capability of this approach in facilitating diverse edits like adding/removing components, deforming surface regions, and refining texture details.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural implicit fields are emerging as a powerful 3D representation for photo-realistic novel view synthesis. However, they lack intuitive editability compared to explicit 3D meshes. 
- Prior work has limitations in editing neural implicit fields, struggling with topology changes, precise color manipulation, and fine-detailed control.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a differentiable colored mesh extraction from neural implicit fields to enable mesh-guided editing. This allows gradient backpropagation from the editable mesh to the implicit fields.
- Introduce an octree-based optimization technique to focus edits on regions of interest like the surface and achieve fine-grained control of geometry and color. 
- Support various edits like object addition/removal, non-rigid deformation, detailed color painting through the colored mesh.

Technical Contributions:
- Present the first differentiable method to extract colored meshes from neural implicit fields, enabling joint optimization of geometry and color.
- Design an octree-based pipeline for fine-grained neural implicit field editing, which prioritizes edited regions. 
- Achieve editing flexibility including topology changes, precise color manipulation, intricate detail control.
- Integrate optimizations like vertex augmentation, camera viewpoint sampling to improve editing quality.

The key insight is to introduce an intermediate explicit representation (colored mesh) to guide implicit field editing. By making this mesh differentiable, changes can be backpropagated to the volumetric field. The octree structure then focuses edits and resources on manipulated regions. Together, this strategy enables precise and flexible neural implicit field editing aligned with creative user inputs.
