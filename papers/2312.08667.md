# [Data and Model Poisoning Backdoor Attacks on Wireless Federated   Learning, and the Defense Mechanisms: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08667)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This comprehensive survey provides an in-depth review of the latest backdoor attacks on Wireless Federated Learning (WFL) and their defense mechanisms. It systematically classifies backdoor attacks based on targets (data poisoning or model poisoning), attack phases (local data collection, training, or aggregation), and defense stages (local training, before/during/after aggregation). Data poisoning attacks like label flipping and trigger injection require little prior knowledge but have limited impact. In contrast, model poisoning attacks like local model replacement and malicious aggregation manipulation are stealthier and more potent but require substantial prior knowledge about the models and system. Defense mechanisms in different phases all aim to detect anomalies and filter out malicious contributions while preserving utility, but face challenges in detection capability, computational efficiency, and compatibility with secure aggregation protocols. The survey highlights exacerbated attack/defense challenges unique to WFL over wireless, including broadcast enabling stronger attacks and security-privacy tradeoffs from channel distortions. It also discusses lessons learned regarding attack-defense interactions and provides insightful directions for future research toward secure and robust WFL.
