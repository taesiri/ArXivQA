# [SpotServe: Serving Generative Large Language Models on Preemptible   Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15566)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents SpotServe, a distributed system for serving large language models (LLMs) on preemptible cloud instances. SpotServe addresses the challenges of frequent instance preemptions and the need to migrate instances. It dynamically adapts the LLM parallelization configuration based on instance availability and workload, balancing throughput, latency, and cost. To minimize migration overhead, SpotServe formulates instance mapping as a bipartite graph matching problem and uses the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to identify the optimal migration plan. It also introduces stateful inference recovery which allows progress to be committed at the token level, enabling preempted requests to resume on other instances. Evaluations on real traces and popular LLMs show SpotServe reduces tail latency by 2.4-9.1x and cuts costs by 54% compared to serving on regular instances, demonstrating fast and reliable LLM serving on low-cost spot instances. The system optimizations like configuration adaptation, optimized migration, and fine-grained recovery are key to achieving these benefits.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents SpotServe, the first distributed large language model serving system on preemptible cloud instances, which uses dynamic reparallelization, efficient context migration, and stateful inference recovery to enable fast, reliable, and cost-effective serving.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is presenting SpotServe, the first distributed large language model (LLM) serving system on preemptible instances. SpotServe introduces several key techniques that enable fast and reliable serving of generative LLMs on cheap preemptible cloud instances:

1) It dynamically adapts the LLM parallelization configuration to handle fluctuating workload and instance availability, balancing tradeoffs between throughput, latency, and cost. 

2) It formulates the task of migrating instances for reparallelization as a bipartite graph matching problem and uses the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to minimize communication cost.

3) It introduces stateful inference recovery to commit inference progress at a much finer granularity and leverage the grace period offered by clouds to cheaply resume inference upon preemption.

Through evaluations on real traces and various popular LLMs, the paper shows SpotServe can reduce the P99 tail latency by 2.4-9.1x and save 54% of monetary cost compared to existing systems, while producing identical results to serving the LLM on regular on-demand instances.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

- Generative large language models (LLMs): The paper focuses on serving large language models that are generative, meaning they can generate natural language text. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT are examples.

- Preemptible instances: The paper specifically looks at serving LLMs on preemptible cloud instances, like AWS spot instances or Azure spot VMs. These provide spare capacity at cheaper prices but can be preempted anytime.

- Dynamic reparallelization: The paper introduces techniques to dynamically adapt the parallelization strategy across instances in response to fluctuations in instance availability and workload. This includes changing parameters like the pipeline model and tensor model parallelism degrees.

- Instance migration: The paper looks at efficiently migrating instances and model parameters when transitioning to a different parallelization configuration to minimize overheads.

- Stateful inference recovery: A technique introduced that allows the system to commit inference progress at a finer, token level to allow seamlessly resuming requests after preemptions. 

- Inference latency: A key metric examined is end-to-end latency for serving inference requests. The goal is to minimize this, especially tail latency metrics.

- Monetary cost: The paper analyzes tradeoffs between inference latency when using preemptible instances versus on-demand instances in terms of monetary costs.

So in summary, the key focus is on optimally serving large language models on spot instances to reduce costs while preserving latency, using dynamic reparallelization and migration techniques.
