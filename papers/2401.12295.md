# [Cheap Learning: Maximising Performance of Language Models for Social   Data Science Using Minimal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conventional machine learning for text classification requires large amounts of manually labeled training data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain in many social science research contexts. This practical limitation inhibits wider uptake of these techniques.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper examines three "cheap learning" techniques that can reduce data requirements: weak supervision, transfer learning, and prompt engineering of large language models (LLMs).

- Weak supervision uses simple heuristic rules and subject matter expertise to automatically label data instead of manual labeling. This generated training data can then be used to train models.

- Transfer learning starts with an existing pre-trained model and fine-tunes it on a small amount of novel in-domain data to adapt it to a new task. This leverages prior knowledge in the pre-trained model to reduce new data requirements.

- Prompt engineering formulates a classification task as a cloze-style prompt that elicits the desired output when provided to a large pre-trained language model like GPT-3. This approach exploits the knowledge already embedded in LLMs to perform classification with little or no labeled training data.

Contributions:

- Compares performance of the above cheap learning techniques to conventional machine learning across two text classification tasks and datasets with varying properties.

- Demonstrates that good performance (Macro F1 ~0.8) can be achieved with very small training sets (as low as 100 examples) using these approaches. LLM performance is particularly impressive.

- Provides practical tutorial on implementing these methods along with open source code to make techniques more accessible for social scientists.

- Discusses model selection, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and cost considerations for applying the techniques.

Overall, the paper introduces useful cheap learning methods to help overcome bottlenecks in training data availability for text analysis in the social sciences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper reviews three 'cheap' machine learning techniques (weak supervision, transfer learning, and prompt engineering) which can enable high-performance text classification with minimal labelled training data, and demonstrates their effectiveness across two text classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is providing an introduction and empirical comparison of three "cheap learning" techniques for text classification in order to reduce the requirements for labelled training data in social science research. The three techniques examined are weak supervision, transfer learning, and prompt engineering/zero-shot learning with large language models. The paper illustrates the performance of these techniques on binary text classification tasks for movie review sentiment and personal attack detection, showing that good performance can be achieved with minimal labelled data. It also releases code to allow other researchers to easily implement these techniques. Overall, the paper aims to promote further uptake of cheap learning techniques to overcome practical impediments to using machine learning for analytical tasks in the social sciences.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Social data science
- Text classification
- Weak supervision 
- Transfer learning
- Prompt engineering
- Language models
- Machine learning
- Automatic content analysis
- Labelling budget

The paper introduces and compares several "cheap learning" techniques for text classification that require less labelled training data than conventional machine learning approaches. The key techniques discussed are weak supervision, transfer learning, and prompt engineering/zero-shot learning with large language models. 

The paper empirically evaluates these techniques on two text classification tasks - binary abuse classification and binary movie review sentiment classification. Key metrics used are Macro F1 scores and learning curves showing model performance based on different amounts of labelled training data (labelling budget).

So in summary, the key terms revolve around cheap machine learning techniques for text classification, the specific methods discussed, the classification tasks used for evaluation, and measures of model performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces three "cheap learning" techniques: weak supervision, transfer learning, and prompt engineering. Can you explain the key differences between these techniques and how they reduce the data requirements compared to conventional machine learning? 

2. For weak supervision, labelling functions are used to encode background knowledge into rules for labelling data. What are some examples of different types of labelling functions that could be created? How can coverage and overlap be used to evaluate and refine labelling functions?

3. Transfer learning involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a downstream task. What considerations should go into selecting an appropriate pre-trained model as the starting point? How is the process of fine-tuning implemented?

4. Prompt engineering exploits the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform classification via carefully designed prompts. What makes crafting an effective prompt non-trivial? How can factors like temperature affect an LLM's output?  

5. The paper evaluates the techniques on binary text classification tasks. How might the relative performance of conventional machine learning vs the cheap learning methods differ for multi-class classification or regression problems?

6. For the movie review sentiment task, how was potential contamination of the training data for LLMs like GPT-3 mitigated? What do the additional experiments on the TMDB dataset demonstrate about the zero-shot performance?

7. How do the computational training time and cost considerations compare between the different cheap learning methods and baseline naive Bayes? Under what circumstances might API costs become prohibitive for prompt engineering?

8. The results show high variance in prompt engineering performance across different random seeds. Why does this highlight the need for reproducibility? What could be done to improve robustness?  

9. How might the relative strengths and weaknesses of these techniques change if applied to more complex analytical tasks involving deeper language understanding, logical reasoning, etc?

10. Given the rapid pace of advancement in LLMs, how might the conclusions change as larger models become more accessible? Could these models make other cheap learning methods redundant in the future?
