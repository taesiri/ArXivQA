# [Unsupervised State Representation Learning in Atari](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08226)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can we learn useful state representations from high-dimensional visual observations in an unsupervised manner for interactive environments like video games?The key points are:- The paper proposes a new unsupervised representation learning technique called Spatiotemporal DeepInfoMax (ST-DIM) that learns state representations by maximizing mutual information across spatial and temporal dimensions. - The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating state representation learning based on Atari 2600 games, where ground truth state variables are extracted to measure how well representations capture the true factors of variation.- The paper compares ST-DIM to other representation learning methods like VAEs, pixel prediction, and CPC on the proposed Atari benchmark.- The results show ST-DIM outperforms other approaches, especially at capturing small objects and avoiding easy-to-exploit features. The paper argues maximizing patch-based mutual information helps ST-DIM learn more complete representations.- Overall, the main research contribution is presenting ST-DIM as a new technique for unsupervised visual representation learning and demonstrating its effectiveness on the Atari benchmark compared to other methods. The benchmark itself is also presented as a useful tool for evaluating progress in representation learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new self-supervised state representation learning technique called Spatiotemporal Deep InfoMax (ST-DIM) that exploits the spatial-temporal nature of visual observations in reinforcement learning environments. The key idea is to maximize mutual information across both spatial and temporal dimensions.2. It introduces a new benchmark for evaluating state representation learning techniques based on 22 Atari 2600 games. The benchmark leverages the source code of the games to extract ground truth state variables (e.g. locations of objects) that can be used to systematically evaluate how well a representation captures the underlying factors of variation.3. It provides an extensive empirical evaluation of existing representation learning techniques like VAEs, pixel prediction, and CPC on the proposed benchmark. The results demonstrate that the proposed ST-DIM technique outperforms prior methods, especially at capturing small objects and in environments where some factors are easy to exploit.4. The paper helps shed light on the tradeoffs between generative and contrastive representation learning techniques. Generative methods are better at capturing large low-entropy objects while contrastive methods prefer high-entropy objects.In summary, the key contributions are proposing a new spatio-temporal contrastive representation learning technique, a systematic benchmark for evaluating such techniques, and an extensive empirical analysis demonstrating the advantages of the proposed approach. The benchmark and analysis help advance research on learning useful state representations.
