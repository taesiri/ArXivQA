# [A Probability Monad as the Colimit of Spaces of Finite Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05363)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:

How can probability measures and probability monads be defined and studied categorically using metric spaces and the Wasserstein distance, in a way that captures key aspects of probability theory? 

More specifically, the authors aim to:

1) Define a probability monad on the category of complete metric spaces, called the Kantorovich monad, that extends previous constructions by van Breugel.

2) Prove that this monad arises naturally from a colimit construction involving finite power-like constructions. This formalizes the intuition that probability measures are limits of finite samples. 

3) Characterize the category of algebras of the Kantorovich monad and show it is equivalent to convex metric spaces.

4) Develop parts of probability theory, like integration, categorically using this monad, without requiring measure theory. 

Overall, the goal is to provide a framework to model probability theory categorically using metric spaces in a way that is more constructive and quantitative than other categorical probability approaches. The colimit perspective and resulting monad structure are the key novel contributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces the Kantorovich monad on the category of complete metric spaces, and studies its properties. The main contributions are:

1. The Kantorovich monad is defined on complete metric spaces and extends previous constructions on compact and 1-bounded metric spaces. It maps a space to the space of probability measures on it equipped with the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric.

2. The monad structure (unit and multiplication) is shown to arise naturally from a colimit characterization. The Kantorovich space of a metric space X is characterized as a colimit of finite power constructions X^n and X_n. 

3. This colimit characterization allows integration theory to be developed categorically without measure theory, by working with the empirical distribution maps from the finite power constructions.

4. The Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras is characterized as the category of closed convex subsets of Banach spaces with short affine maps. 

5. The monad structure is constructed by lifting the colimit to the category of monoidal categories, using a Kan extension.

Overall, the paper provides a thorough categorical treatment of probability theory on metric spaces, with several novel contributions in developing the theory of the Kantorovich monad and elucidating its properties. The colimit perspective and convex subset characterization seem particularly valuable.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- It develops the Kantorovich monad, a monadic approach to probability theory on metric spaces. This extends previous monadic approaches like the Giry monad and van Breugel's work, allowing probability measures on complete metric spaces rather than just Polish or compact spaces.

- The colimit characterization of the Kantorovich monad is novel. It formalizes the intuition of probability measures as limits of finite samples, and allows developing integration theory without measure theory. Other categorical probability papers don't take this operational approach.

- Representing probability measures via functionals on Lip-functions is standard, but the detailed treatment of properties like Ï„-smoothness seems more thorough than usual. The representation theorem is similar to results of Fremlin and Edgar.

- The study of algebras uses ideas like convex spaces that have precedents in the work of Swirszcz and others. But the full characterization of algebras as closed convex subsets of Banach spaces is cleaner than in related monads like Giry.

- The application of results about monoidal Kan extensions to construct the monad structure is technically novel, as previous papers rely just on general enriched category theory arguments.

Overall, the paper seems to connect with established literature but also contains new conceptual and technical ideas. The colimit perspective and convex subset characterization appear unique. The level of categorical detail is impressive compared to more probability-focused works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing additional categorical probability theories, such as for metric spaces, which the authors do in this paper for the Wasserstein metric. As the authors mention, this may help with making probability theory more constructive and with obtaining categorical proofs of approximation theorems.

- Exploring integration theory and measures on spaces of measures in the context of the Kantorovich monad, without the need for traditional measure theory. The colimit characterization of the monad could facilitate this.

- Using the metric structure to find categorical formulations and proofs of fundamental results in probability theory related to approximation, such as the law of large numbers and the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem.

- Further characterizing the algebras of the Kantorovich monad, for example in terms of convex spaces. The authors suggest trying to relate them also to the concept of metric mean-value algebras.

- Developing probability theory internal to categories, using the operadic convex combination structure on metric spaces. The authors suggest improving their characterization of algebras in terms of internal algebras.

- Relating the probability monads on metric spaces to enriched Lawvere theories and exploring the connection to graded monads.

- Investigating the meaning of the informal links between probability theory on metric spaces and on finite probability spaces.

- Applying the theory to give a formal derivation of integration from categorical principles, without measure theory.

Overall, the authors point to many directions for categorical probability theory in metric spaces, leveraging operadic convex combinations and the Kantorovich monad, in order to obtain more constructive and abstract approaches to probability. Their colimit characterization also opens possibilities for measure theory on function spaces.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces and studies the Kantorovich monad on the category of complete metric spaces and short maps. The Kantorovich monad assigns to each complete metric space X the space PX of probability measures on X with finite first moment, equipped with the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. The monad multiplication is given by taking the expected distribution of a probability measure on probability measures. The Kantorovich monad is analogous to the Giry monad on Polish spaces. The key result is that PX arises as a colimit of finite power constructions, which formalizes the intuition that probability measures are limits of finite samples. This colimit characterization allows the Kantorovich monad structure to be defined directly, without using measure theory. The category of algebras of the Kantorovich monad is shown to be equivalent to the category of closed convex subsets of Banach spaces with short affine maps.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper defines and studies a probability monad on the category of complete metric spaces and short maps, called the Kantorovich monad. This monad assigns to each space X the space PX of probability measures on X with finite first moment, equipped with the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. The Kantorovich monad extends previous work by van Breugel on compact and 1-bounded complete metric spaces. 

A key result is that the Kantorovich monad arises from a colimit construction formalizing the idea that probability measures are limits of finite samples. Specifically, PX is shown to be the colimit of power functors X^S and X_n taking values in finite sets S and n. This allows for the development of integration theory and measures on spaces of measures categorically, without requiring measure theory. The paper also shows the category of algebras of the Kantorovich monad is equivalent to convex metric spaces, giving an intrinsic characterization.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the Kantorovich monad, an endofunctor on the category of complete metric spaces that assigns to each space X the set of probability measures on X with finite first moment, equipped with the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. The main result is a characterization of this monad structure as arising from a colimit construction, motivated by modeling probability measures as formal limits of finite samples. Specifically, the authors define power functors which assign to a metric space its finite cartesian powers with a rescaled metric, meant to represent finite sampling. Taking the colimit of these functors recovers the Kantorovich monad, with the universal cocone given by the empirical distribution maps. This colimit characterization is used to construct the monad structure and study the resulting notion of integration. Overall, the paper gives a conceptual construction of the Kantorovich monad in terms of sampling, without relying directly on measure theory.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the introduction and abstract, this paper appears to address the following main topics:

- Defining a probability monad called the Kantorovich monad on the category of complete metric spaces, extending previous work by van Breugel on compact metric spaces. The Kantorovich monad assigns probability measures with finite first moment to metric spaces.

- Showing that this monad arises from a colimit construction involving finite power functors. This formalizes the intuition that probability measures are limits of finite samples.

- Using this colimit characterization to define the monad structure, instead of using analytical arguments. 

- Characterizing the category of algebras of the Kantorovich monad as the category of closed convex subsets of Banach spaces with short affine maps.

- Establishing that the category of metric spaces is an algebra for the simplex operad of convex combinations. This provides further motivation for the power functor construction used in defining the monad.

In summary, the main focus seems to be on giving a complete categorical construction of the Kantorovich monad and its algebras using colimits, without relying directly on analytical arguments. The colimit perspective allows probability theory to be approached more constructively.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a potential high-quality summary paragraph for the paper:

The paper introduces the Kantorovich monad, a probability monad defined on the category of complete metric spaces and short maps. This monad assigns to each space X the set of Radon probability measures on X with finite first moment, equipped with the Kantorovich-Rubinstein or Wasserstein distance. A key result is that this monad arises from a colimit construction, which formalizes the intuition that probability measures are limits of finite samples. Specifically, the Wasserstein space is shown to be the colimit of the power functors, and the empirical distribution maps form the universal cocone. This colimit characterization allows for an integration theory and measures on measure spaces to be studied without full measure theory. The Kantorovich monad is analogous to the Giry monad on Polish spaces and extends prior work of van Breugel. Another contribution is a study of the category of algebras, shown to be equivalent to convex subsets of Banach spaces. Overall, the paper develops the foundations of a categorical probability theory based on metric rather than measurable structure.
