# [A Probability Monad as the Colimit of Spaces of Finite Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05363)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:How can probability measures and probability monads be defined and studied categorically using metric spaces and the Wasserstein distance, in a way that captures key aspects of probability theory? More specifically, the authors aim to:1) Define a probability monad on the category of complete metric spaces, called the Kantorovich monad, that extends previous constructions by van Breugel.2) Prove that this monad arises naturally from a colimit construction involving finite power-like constructions. This formalizes the intuition that probability measures are limits of finite samples. 3) Characterize the category of algebras of the Kantorovich monad and show it is equivalent to convex metric spaces.4) Develop parts of probability theory, like integration, categorically using this monad, without requiring measure theory. Overall, the goal is to provide a framework to model probability theory categorically using metric spaces in a way that is more constructive and quantitative than other categorical probability approaches. The colimit perspective and resulting monad structure are the key novel contributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces the Kantorovich monad on the category of complete metric spaces, and studies its properties. The main contributions are:1. The Kantorovich monad is defined on complete metric spaces and extends previous constructions on compact and 1-bounded metric spaces. It maps a space to the space of probability measures on it equipped with the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric.2. The monad structure (unit and multiplication) is shown to arise naturally from a colimit characterization. The Kantorovich space of a metric space X is characterized as a colimit of finite power constructions X^n and X_n. 3. This colimit characterization allows integration theory to be developed categorically without measure theory, by working with the empirical distribution maps from the finite power constructions.4. The Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras is characterized as the category of closed convex subsets of Banach spaces with short affine maps. 5. The monad structure is constructed by lifting the colimit to the category of monoidal categories, using a Kan extension.Overall, the paper provides a thorough categorical treatment of probability theory on metric spaces, with several novel contributions in developing the theory of the Kantorovich monad and elucidating its properties. The colimit perspective and convex subset characterization seem particularly valuable.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:- It develops the Kantorovich monad, a monadic approach to probability theory on metric spaces. This extends previous monadic approaches like the Giry monad and van Breugel's work, allowing probability measures on complete metric spaces rather than just Polish or compact spaces.- The colimit characterization of the Kantorovich monad is novel. It formalizes the intuition of probability measures as limits of finite samples, and allows developing integration theory without measure theory. Other categorical probability papers don't take this operational approach.- Representing probability measures via functionals on Lip-functions is standard, but the detailed treatment of properties like Ï„-smoothness seems more thorough than usual. The representation theorem is similar to results of Fremlin and Edgar.- The study of algebras uses ideas like convex spaces that have precedents in the work of Swirszcz and others. But the full characterization of algebras as closed convex subsets of Banach spaces is cleaner than in related monads like Giry.- The application of results about monoidal Kan extensions to construct the monad structure is technically novel, as previous papers rely just on general enriched category theory arguments.Overall, the paper seems to connect with established literature but also contains new conceptual and technical ideas. The colimit perspective and convex subset characterization appear unique. The level of categorical detail is impressive compared to more probability-focused works.
