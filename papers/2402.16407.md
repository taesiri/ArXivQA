# [CMC: Few-shot Novel View Synthesis via Cross-view Multiplane Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "CMC: Few-shot Novel View Synthesis via Cross-view Multiplane Consistency":

Problem:
- Novel view synthesis aims to render novel view images given a few input view images. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive results but depend heavily on dense input views and tend to overfit when only a few input views are available. This overfitting results in estimated pixel depths sharing almost the same value.

- Existing methods tackle this either by using expensive pre-training, additional supervisions like depth maps, generating pseudo views, or regularization terms. However, they have limitations like domain gap, lack of cross-view interactions, handcrafted sampling strategies.

Proposed Solution:
- The key idea is to force the sampling points to be identical across different input views during volume rendering. This builds depth-aware consistency across views to alleviate overfitting. 

- To achieve this, per-view Multiplane Images (MPIs) are constructed, with each input view as the reference view. This distributes sampling points on discrete planes.

- Two losses enforce cross-view multiplane consistency: (1) Reconstruction loss between rendered and GT input views (2) Appearance and depth consistency losses between views rendered from different MPIs.

Main Contributions:
- Propose cross-view multiplane consistency (CMC) via per-view MPIs and appearance/depth consistency losses for few-shot view synthesis.

- Provide analysis and intuition that forcing identical sampling points across views alleviates overfitting to input views. 

- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex real datasets without scene priors or handcrafted sampling strategies. Demonstrate superiority over existing pre-training, regularization and pseudo-view methods.
