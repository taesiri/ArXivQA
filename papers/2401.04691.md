# [AI-based Mapping of the Conservation Status of Orchid Assemblages at   Global Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04691)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of accurate global maps showing the conservation status and extinction risk of species assemblages (groups of phylogenetically related species in a community). This information is needed to identify vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and prioritize conservation actions.

- Only 7% of described species have an IUCN conservation status. There are large assessment gaps, especially in the tropics.

- Existing spatial indicators of extinction risk rely only on officially assessed IUCN species. They ignore unassessed species, which make up the majority.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a deep learning model to predict global assemblages of 14,000 orchid species at 1km resolution. 

- They assign each species a known or predicted IUCN status. Two indicators are then calculated for each assemblage:
   1) Proportion of threatened species
   2) Most threatened IUCN status in the assemblage

- These indicators reflect the extinction risk faced by orchid assemblages worldwide. Interactive maps are published online.

Main Contributions:
- First global indicators of assemblage-level extinction risk at kilometre-scale resolution

- Coverage of 14,000 orchid species worldwide, with IUCN status completed by predictions

- Identification of priority areas for conservation from global patterns down to landscape details

- Demonstration that deep learning can reliably model species niches and assemble communities

- Proposition of orchids as an umbrella taxon to locate vulnerable ecosystems and guide conservation planning

The paper discusses insights at multiple scales and shows how the indicators relate to protected areas in Sumatra. Overall, this work enables an assessment of extinction threats faced by ecosystems worldwide thanks to recent advances in deep learning and big data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces global indicators mapping the extinction risk of orchid assemblages at an unprecedented 1km resolution, enabling multi-scale analysis from global patterns down to regional statistics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing global indicators that qualify the extinction risk of species assemblages at an unprecedented kilometre resolution. Specifically:

1) The authors train a deep learning species distribution model on 1 million orchid observations to predict orchid species assemblages globally at 1km resolution. 

2) They propose two novel indicators to characterize the conservation status of the predicted assemblages: (i) proportion of threatened species, and (ii) status of the most threatened species.

3) They construct high-resolution global maps visualizing these indicators, enabling analysis of extinction risk patterns at multiple scales - from global trends down to regional landscapes. 

4) Case studies analyze and compare extinction risk levels between regions, in relation to orchid diversity and protected areas.

5) The interactive maps and species assemblage prediction model are made openly available to support research and conservation efforts.

In summary, this paper enables qualifying extinction risk of species assemblages at an unprecedented scale through novel deep learning methods and spatial indicators. The outcomes provide valuable insights to guide conservation priorities across regions and scales.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Species assemblage prediction model - The paper introduces a novel machine learning model to predict sets of species (assemblages) likely to occur at a given location based on environmental variables.

- Deep learning - The model uses a deep neural network architecture (Inception v3 convolutional neural network) to capture complex spatial relationships between species occurrences and environmental predictors. 

- Orchidaceae - The model is trained on a large global dataset of orchid species occurrence records to predict orchid assemblages.

- Spatial indicators - Novel indicators are proposed to characterize the extinction risk and diversity of predicted orchid assemblages, including the most critical IUCN status (I_O), the proportion of threatened species (I_c), and the Shannon diversity index (I_H).

- High resolution mapping - The indicators are mapped at an unprecedented 1km resolution globally using the trained model to predict assemblages across a worldwide grid. 

- Conservation planning - The indicators and maps are designed to identify priority areas and support conservation area planning and actions, with a case study presented on Sumatra.

- Scale dependence - The paper emphasizes multi-scale analysis, from global indicator maps down to country statistics and fine-scale spatial patterns.

So in summary, key concepts revolve around using deep learning and big biodiversity data to generate high-resolution, mapped extinction risk indicators for conservation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces novel indicators $\mathcal{I}_c$ and $\mathcal{I}_\mathcal{O}$ to characterize the extinction risk of predicted species assemblages. Could you expand on the motivation and logic behind designing these specific indicators? How do they capture different aspects of extinction risk compared to existing indicators?

2. You calibrate the species assemblage prediction model by controlling the average error rate. Could you explain in more detail the rationale behind this approach and the trade-off it entails between model generalization and over-prediction? 

3. The paper validates the species assemblage predictions to guarantee the true species is included with 97\% micro-average accuracy. However, macro-average accuracy is lower at 80\%. What does this difference in performance indicate about the model's ability to predict assemblages for rare vs common species?

4. You supplement missing IUCN conservation status with predictions from the IUCNN method. What is the impact of including predicted status on the final maps and indicators? How does it change the narrative compared to relying solely on official IUCN assessments?

5. The orchid family is proposed as a suitable taxon to indicate regions of high extinction risk. However, what are some limitations of relying solely on orchids as an umbrella group? What other taxa or additional data could supplement orchids as biodiversity indicators?  

6. The interactive maps provide species assemblage indicators at an unprecedented scale and resolution. What new insights can be gained from kilometer-scale global indicators compared to previous coarse-scale mappings of extinction risk?

7. The indicators are validated based on model performance, but have they been ground-truthed or tested for relevance to real-world conservation priorities? What steps would be needed to confirm the on-the-ground usefulness of these maps?

8. Deep learning models forgo interpretability for performance. What future work could help elucidate the drivers and interactions captured by the neural networks to make these biodiversity models more explainable?

9. The paper mentions corridors along mountain ranges as a potential conservation priority based on the maps. More generally, how can the multi-scale nature of these indicators help guide conservation planning, from global hotspots down to landscape connectivity? 

10. These species assemblage indicators quantify extinction risk in a novel way compared to prior methods. What new research directions do you see as most promising to build on this approach to mapping conservation status?
