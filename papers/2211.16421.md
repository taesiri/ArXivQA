# [RGB no more: Minimally-decoded JPEG Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: can we design neural networks that process images encoded in the frequency domain rather than the spatial domain? 

Specifically, the paper investigates training Vision Transformers (ViTs) directly on JPEG-encoded Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, avoiding the computationally expensive decoding steps to convert to RGB pixels. This allows for much faster data loading and throughput during training and inference.

The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:

1) ViTs are well-suited for processing frequency domain image representations like JPEG DCT, requiring only simple modifications to the patch embedding layer.

2) Data augmentation techniques can be adapted to directly augment images in the DCT domain, avoiding costly conversions to RGB for augmentation.

3) ViTs trained on JPEG DCT can match the accuracy of RGB models while significantly accelerating training and inference due to faster data loading.

So in summary, the central research question is whether neural networks, specifically ViTs, can be effectively trained directly on frequency domain image representations like JPEG DCT to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides evidence supporting this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing an approach to train Vision Transformers (ViTs) directly on JPEG-encoded images, avoiding the cost of decoding to RGB pixels. The key insight is that ViTs process images in patches, which matches well with the block-wise structure of JPEG encoding. 

- Designing data augmentations to work directly on JPEG-encoded images, avoiding the cost of decoding to RGB, augmenting, and re-encoding. The authors categorize augmentations into photometric (altering pixel values) and geometric (modifying image geometry).

- Conducting experiments on ImageNet showing their JPEG-trained ViTs match the accuracy of RGB-trained ViTs, while having significantly faster training and inference due to avoiding decoding. For example, their JPEG ViT-Ti model is 39.2% faster for training and 17.9% faster for inference versus the RGB version.

- Proposing and evaluating different patch embedding strategies for accepting JPEG-encoded inputs into a ViT. They find a simple "grouped" strategy works best.

- Performing ablation studies analyzing the impact of different data augmentations applied directly to the JPEG encoding.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the potential for accelerating ViT training and inference by operating directly on JPEG-encoded images, which avoids the overhead of decoding. The modifications to ViT architecture and data augmentation to enable this are secondary contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes training vision transformers directly on JPEG encoded images to avoid decoding overhead, using modifications to the patch embedding layer and data augmentations adapted for the frequency domain.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other work on training neural networks directly from JPEG encoded images:

- Previous works such as Gueguen et al. and Xu et al. focused on adapting CNN architectures like ResNet and MobileNet to take DCT coefficients as input. This often required nontrivial modifications to handle the heterogeneous YCbCr data. In contrast, this paper shows Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be easily adapted just by changing the patch embedding layer.

- For data augmentation, prior works had to convert DCT to RGB, augment, then convert back to DCT. This negates the speed benefits during training. This paper implements augmentations directly on DCT, avoiding any RGB conversions.

- The paper introduces several new DCT-based augmentations like AutoSaturation, MidfreqAug, and ChromaDrop. It also adapts all RandAugment operations to DCT using properties like the DC component and frequency components. 

- Previous works achieved comparable accuracy to RGB networks when training on DCT, but did not demonstrate significant speedups. This paper shows up to 39.2% faster training and 17.9% faster inference compared to an RGB ViT, with no loss in accuracy.

- The paper emphasizes that avoiding JPEG decode is important even with fast models, as data loading can still be a bottleneck. They show their DCT ViT gets 36.2% faster training with mixed precision.

Overall, this paper pushes encoded-space training further by showing ViTs are well-suited for it, devising efficient DCT augmentations, and demonstrating appreciable speedups versus RGB models. The techniques could help accelerate computer vision systems that process JPEG images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

1. Exploring other vision transformer architectures besides ViT. The authors only considered plain ViT in this work, but believe encoded-space training could benefit other efficient ViT architectures as well.

2. Developing better data augmentation strategies directly in the encoded space. The authors designed reasonable augmentations for DCT, but believe there is room for improvement, especially to handle things like rotation and shearing more efficiently.

3. Adapting the approach to other encoded representations beyond JPEG/DCT. The concepts could potentially apply to other compression algorithms or neural compressors.

4. Applying encoded-space training to other domains like video or point clouds. The authors only considered images, but video codecs and 3D representations could also benefit.

5. Combining with model compression techniques like pruning or quantization. Faster data loading opens up opportunities to also accelerate the model itself.

6. Testing on a wider range of datasets and computer vision tasks. The authors only experimented on ImageNet classification.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring more architectures, augmentations, encodings, applications, and model optimizations to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of training directly in the encoded space. The core ideas could have broad applicability in computer vision and beyond.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes training Vision Transformers (ViTs) directly on JPEG encoded images rather than decoding to RGB first. Typically images are stored as JPEG files but need to be decoded to RGB before feeding to a neural network, which adds overhead. The paper shows that ViTs can be easily adapted to take JPEG Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as input by modifying only the initial patch embedding layer. They also implement common image augmentations directly on the DCT coefficients, avoiding costly DCT-RGB conversions during training. Experiments on ImageNet show their proposed ViT models achieve similar accuracy to RGB models but with up to 39.2% faster training and 17.9% faster inference, due to avoiding JPEG decode. The paper demonstrates the potential for neural networks that operate directly on compressed image representations like JPEG.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes training Vision Transformers (ViTs) directly on JPEG encoded images, rather than decoding to RGB first. JPEG images are commonly stored as frequency domain representations rather than spatial RGB pixels. By training on the JPEG encoded features, the expensive decoding step can be avoided to accelerate data loading. Prior works have studied this for CNNs, but modifying CNN architectures to accept the JPEG encoded features is nontrivial. ViTs are well suited for this task since their patch embedding layer matches the patch structure of JPEG encoded images. The paper introduces several strategies to embed JPEG patches into ViT models while leaving the rest of the architecture unchanged. Additionally, the paper tackles data augmentation directly on the JPEG features to avoid decoding to RGB during training. Through these innovations, the paper shows their ViT-Ti model achieves up to 39.2% faster training and 17.9% faster inference versus an RGB ViT, with no loss in accuracy.

In summary, this paper demonstrates that ViT models can be trained directly on JPEG encoded images by modifying only the initial patch embedding layer. This allows the expensive decoding step to RGB to be avoided, substantially accelerating training and inference. Data augmentation techniques for JPEG features are also introduced. The JPEG trained ViT models match the accuracy of RGB models, while being much faster due to avoiding decoding. This could have broad applications for accelerating computer vision pipelines.
