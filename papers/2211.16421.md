# [RGB no more: Minimally-decoded JPEG Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: can we design neural networks that process images encoded in the frequency domain rather than the spatial domain? 

Specifically, the paper investigates training Vision Transformers (ViTs) directly on JPEG-encoded Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, avoiding the computationally expensive decoding steps to convert to RGB pixels. This allows for much faster data loading and throughput during training and inference.

The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:

1) ViTs are well-suited for processing frequency domain image representations like JPEG DCT, requiring only simple modifications to the patch embedding layer.

2) Data augmentation techniques can be adapted to directly augment images in the DCT domain, avoiding costly conversions to RGB for augmentation.

3) ViTs trained on JPEG DCT can match the accuracy of RGB models while significantly accelerating training and inference due to faster data loading.

So in summary, the central research question is whether neural networks, specifically ViTs, can be effectively trained directly on frequency domain image representations like JPEG DCT to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides evidence supporting this hypothesis.
