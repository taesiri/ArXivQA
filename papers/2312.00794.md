# [Informative Priors Improve the Reliability of Multimodal Clinical Data   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for safe and trustworthy machine learning models in healthcare, but existing methods often fail to provide consistent improvements.  
- There is limited research on uncertainty quantification for multimodal learning in healthcare, despite its increasing use.
- Challenges include lack of tailored solutions for clinical tasks, scaling issues, lack of informative priors from medical experts, and prevalence of data shifts.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a multimodal data-driven (M2D2) prior distribution over neural network parameters to improve uncertainty quantification in multimodal fusion models.
- Construct the M2D2 prior using modality-specific perturbations of training data to create a context dataset with desirable distribution shifts.  
- Use the context dataset in Gaussian mean-field variational inference to find an approximate posterior distribution that induces high uncertainty on out-of-distribution inputs.
- Apply this Bayesian neural network to multimodal fusion of clinical time series and chest X-rays for multi-label classification of acute care conditions.

Contributions:
- Design of the M2D2 prior tailored to multimodal clinical data.
- Evaluation on large public datasets: MIMIC-IV (time series) and MIMIC-CXR (chest X-rays).
- Improved performance over baselines as measured by AUROC, AUPRC, and selective prediction metrics.
- Increased reliability demonstrated through uncertainty-aware selective prediction.

Overall, the paper presents a principled Bayesian framework to improve uncertainty quantification in multimodal deep learning models for healthcare via an informative prior distribution constructed from the data itself. The empirical results highlight the potential of this method to enhance model reliability in clinical applications.
