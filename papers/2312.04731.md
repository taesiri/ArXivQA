# [STraceBERT: Source Code Retrieval using Semantic Application Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04731)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Software reverse engineering from binaries is challenging, especially for adversarial/obfuscated code like ransomware. Existing decompilers fail on obfuscated code.
- Goal is to reconstruct original source code to understand functionality and vulnerabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Key idea: while obfuscation can hide control flow, variable names, etc., it cannot hide system calls without a rootkit. 
- Record system call traces at runtime using tools like strace (Unix) or dynamic analysis for Java.
- Train a BERT-style neural model called STraceBERT on sequences of recorded Java library calls from open source projects.
- Use the trained model to embed/encode new observed traces.
- Given a new trace, find most similar traces from the dataset based on embedding proximity. 
- Retrieve associated source code snippets to present to reverse engineer.

Key Contributions:
- Created Java Trace Dataset (JTD) of 30 Java projects with recorded test suite traces, call sequences, source code. 
- Proposed STraceBERT - a BERT model adapted for trace sequence embedding and source code retrieval.
- Evaluated on a candidate set and two test sets, STraceBERT outperforms BM25 and Codex for source code retrieval when common libraries are used.
- Showed trace embeddings can find source code with high semantic similarity without exact matches.
- Proposed approach is robust against control flow/name obfuscation and provides promising solution to reverse engineering.

In summary, the key insight is leveraging system/library calls that can't be hidden to find similar source code snippets through neural trace embeddings. The paper shows promising results on a new Java Trace Dataset using the proposed STraceBERT model.
