# [STraceBERT: Source Code Retrieval using Semantic Application Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04731)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Software reverse engineering from binaries is challenging, especially for adversarial/obfuscated code like ransomware. Existing decompilers fail on obfuscated code.
- Goal is to reconstruct original source code to understand functionality and vulnerabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Key idea: while obfuscation can hide control flow, variable names, etc., it cannot hide system calls without a rootkit. 
- Record system call traces at runtime using tools like strace (Unix) or dynamic analysis for Java.
- Train a BERT-style neural model called STraceBERT on sequences of recorded Java library calls from open source projects.
- Use the trained model to embed/encode new observed traces.
- Given a new trace, find most similar traces from the dataset based on embedding proximity. 
- Retrieve associated source code snippets to present to reverse engineer.

Key Contributions:
- Created Java Trace Dataset (JTD) of 30 Java projects with recorded test suite traces, call sequences, source code. 
- Proposed STraceBERT - a BERT model adapted for trace sequence embedding and source code retrieval.
- Evaluated on a candidate set and two test sets, STraceBERT outperforms BM25 and Codex for source code retrieval when common libraries are used.
- Showed trace embeddings can find source code with high semantic similarity without exact matches.
- Proposed approach is robust against control flow/name obfuscation and provides promising solution to reverse engineering.

In summary, the key insight is leveraging system/library calls that can't be hidden to find similar source code snippets through neural trace embeddings. The paper shows promising results on a new Java Trace Dataset using the proposed STraceBERT model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions tracing test suites to construct the candidate set. Why is using test suites optimal for this task? What are some potential issues with only using test suites?

2. The STraceBERT model uses a custom tokenizer to represent each call signature with a unique token. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to using the full method signatures?

3. The paper compares performance with and without call boundaries. Why do you think including the call boundaries improves performance, especially for the top@1 measure? What could be some ways to further improve the usefulness of the boundary tokens? 

4. The paper leaves hyperparameters optimization to future work. What hyperparameters would you focus on tuning first if you were extending this work? What range of values would you explore?

5. The trace embeddings are created by pretraining STraceBERT using masked language modeling. What are some other pretraining objectives that could be effective for this task? Why?

6. The Java Trace Dataset contains traces from 30 Java projects. How could the diversity and size of the dataset impact model performance? What steps could be taken to create a more robust dataset?

7. The paper demonstrates similarity between ground truth and retrieved code snippets. However, how would you evaluate if the snippets are actually useful and interpretable for a reverse engineer? 

8. For the code retrieval task, only the top 5 candidates are evaluated. Why is this a useful measure for reverse engineering? How would you determine the optimal number of candidates to retrieve?

9. The evaluation is performed on open source Java projects. How do you expect the approach to perform on adversarial, obfuscated binaries? What modifications would be needed to evaluate robustness?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on Java traces. Do you think this method could be adapted to other programming languages and environments? What challenges might arise?
