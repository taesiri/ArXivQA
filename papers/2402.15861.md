# [MATHWELL: Generating Educational Math Word Problems at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15861)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Math word problems are critical for K-8 education, but teachers lack time to customize them to student interests. Existing math word problem generators rely on pre-specified equations or example problems, limiting their usefulness. Further, no generators produce both the question and answer.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose the first context-free educational math word problem generator, called MATHWELL. It is an iteratively finetuned Llama-2 model that generates customized word problems and Python function solutions given an optional student interest topic. 

To train MATHWELL, the authors collect human annotations to identify high-quality samples that are solvable, have accurate solutions, and are age-appropriate. They use these samples for further finetuning.

Using MATHWELL, the authors generate a dataset called SGSM with over 20K word problems. A subset of 3.5K problems are annotated by experts.

Contributions:
- First educational context-free math word problem generator that produces both the question and answer
- MATHWELL outperforms other models in generating solvable, accurate and appropriate problems (74.8% meet all criteria)
- Release of SGSM, the largest public English word problem dataset
- SGSM subset with expert annotations to verify quality and enable further research

The key innovation is the context-free generation approach combined with iterative expert human feedback to produce high-quality customized educational math word problems. MATHWELL and the datasets advance capabilities for automating math education personalization.
