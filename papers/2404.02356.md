# [Two Heads are Better than One: Nested PoE for Robust Defense Against   Multi-Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Backdoor attacks on neural networks can cause undesirable behaviors by inserting triggers into the training data. Existing defenses often assume only one trigger type is used and fail against multiple simultaneous triggers. Defending against mixtures of triggers is challenging but critical as real attacks may use diverse triggers. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new defense framework called Nested Product of Experts (NPoE). It extends the Product of Experts (PoE) framework by having multiple "trigger-only" models in a mixture to capture different triggers. 

Key ideas:
- Use an ensemble (mixture) of shallow "trigger-only" models to capture different types of backdoor triggers.
- Combine predictions from trigger-only models using a learned gating function. 
- Train the main model with the trigger-only mixture using PoE. The mixture learns the backdoor shortcuts, leaving the main model to learn from residual clean signals.

Contributions:
1. Propose NPoE defense for simultaneous multiple trigger types using ensemble of trigger models.
2. Improve strategy for constructing pseudo dev sets for model selection when dataset has unknown multiple triggers. 
3. Experiments show NPoE effectively defends against diverse triggers separately and in mixtures across multiple NLP tasks.

In summary, the paper tackles the challenging but practical problem of defending against multiple unknown backdoor triggers. The proposed Nested PoE method uses an ensemble framework to handle diverse triggers and shows strong empirical results. The defense does not rely on detecting triggers, making it robust against implicit triggers.
