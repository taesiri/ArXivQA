# [How to Configure Good In-Context Sequence for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01571)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores strategies for configuring the in-context learning demonstrations to enhance the performance of large vision-language models (LVLMs) on the visual question answering (VQA) task. The authors design various methods to retrieve and manipulate demonstration samples and conduct exhaustive experiments using the Open-Flamingo LVLM. Through analysis, they uncover three important properties of Open-Flamingo - limited task learning ability compared to strong task recognition, susceptibility to shortcut reasoning, and mismatch between the vision and language modules. To address these limitations, they identify effective demonstration configuration techniques, including using similar images and text which provide visual and linguistic cues to improve learning. Pseudo-answers also assist by correcting wrong inferences. Additionally, instructions enhance format recognition and task learning, especially for linguistically stronger models like Open-Flamingo v2. Ultimately, the research provides valuable insights into optimizing LVLMs for VQA through strategic demonstration design, while also furthering understanding of their inner workings. The proposed analysis framework using demonstrations can potentially be extended to evaluate other LVLMs.
