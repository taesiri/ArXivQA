# [A Simple and Scalable Representation for Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02230)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most graph generative models face challenges when generating large-scale graphs due to their reliance on generating full adjacency matrices, which grows quadratically with the number of nodes. While some works have explored edge list representations that scale linearly with the number of edges, they suffer from a vast vocabulary space that makes learning difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Gap Encoded Edge List (GEEL) representation that enjoys a compact representation size aligned with the number of edges while significantly reducing the vocabulary size. This is achieved via:

1) Replacing node indices in edge lists with gap encodings - the difference between node indices (intra-edge gaps) and difference between source nodes of consecutive edges (inter-edge gaps). This bounds vocabulary size by the graph bandwidth squared.

2) Reducing graph bandwidth via Cuthill-McKee node ordering.

3) Autoregressive generation of GEEL using an LSTM combined with node positional encodings. 

4) Extension to attributed graphs via a grammar specifying positions of node/edge types.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of a simple yet effective graph representation GEEL that is scalable with number of edges and has a small vocabulary size of bandwidth squared.

- Demonstration that GEEL can be autoregressively generated using an LSTM in linear time complexity.

- Design of a grammar to extend GEEL to attributed graphs.

- State-of-the-art performance on 12 graph generation benchmarks, including general and molecular graphs, validating efficacy and scalability.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in designing a compact yet expressive graph representation and associated generative framework that scales to large graphs.
