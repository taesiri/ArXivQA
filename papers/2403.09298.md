# [More than words: Advancements and challenges in speech recognition for   singing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the advancements and remaining challenges in applying automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology specifically to singing. The author argues that while ASR has seen great progress in recent years, singing poses unique difficulties that require specialized solutions. 

The paper first explains how singing differs from regular speech as an input signal, with greater pitch fluctuations, elongated vowels, varied pronunciations, and musical accompaniment that confuses ASR systems. It then chronicles the history of ASR research tailored to singing, including the author's own work beginning in 2011 when singing-specific datasets and deep learning solutions were still scarce. 

The paper delves into core research areas in singing ASR: phoneme recognition, language identification, keyword spotting, lyrics alignment, lyrics-based retrieval, and full lyrics transcription. For each task, it summarizes early approaches, the author's key contributions using classical machine learning, and recent advancements utilizing deep neural networks and larger datasets. It also describes the creation of new singing datasets that have helped progress after years of limited data availability.  

The paper concludes that the field has reached an inflection point with end-to-end deep learning models now achieving promising results in full lyrics transcription. It also foresees greater adoption of large language models and multimodal systems to unify different singing ASR tasks into an integrated solution. The progress promises to enhance music discovery and recommendation, promote cultural exchange through world music, and increase accessibility for the hearing-impaired.

In summary, this is a comprehensive review targeted at researchers which chronicles the evolution of speech recognition tailored to singing over the past two decades. It argues that while singing ASR now seems viable after years of struggle, specialized modelling is imperative to handle singingâ€™s distinct properties. With modern deep learning and sufficient data, the field can now build accurate and unified ASR systems to unlock novel music applications.
