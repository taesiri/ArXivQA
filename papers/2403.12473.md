# [PostoMETRO: Pose Token Enhanced Mesh Transformer for Robust 3D Human   Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12473)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reconstructing 3D human meshes from single images is challenging, especially in the presence of occlusions. Existing methods rely on intermediate 3D pose representations or parametric body models, which have limitations. Non-parametric methods like MetroNet directly predict 3D coordinates but struggle with occlusions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes PostoMETRO, a framework to incorporate 2D poses into MetroNet-like transformers. A pose tokenizer compresses 2D poses into compact, occlusion-robust pose tokens. These tokens are fed as inputs to transformer encoders, in addition to image tokens. The robust pose tokens provide useful priors to handle occlusions. Transformers decode tokens into 3D joint and vertex coordinates to reconstruct the 3D mesh.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes representing 2D poses as discrete pose tokens and integrating them with image tokens in transformers for mesh reconstruction. The pose tokens encode spatial relationships to aid occlusion handling.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3DPW dataset and occlusion-specific datasets like 3DPW-OCC, 3DPW-PC and 3DOH. Shows consistent gains by using pose tokens across scenarios.

- Pose tokens bring 5.5-8.1% improvement in metrics over baseline on 3DPW dataset. Qualitative results demonstrate pose tokens help recover occluded body parts.

- Ablations highlight superiority of using multi-modal tokens over individual image or pose tokens. Pose tokens greatly enhance occlusion robustness even without explicit occlusion-specific design.

In summary, the paper presents an effective way to incorporate 2D pose priors into non-parametric mesh prediction models via pose tokenization. The robustness in occlusion scenarios is a noteworthy advantage of this transformer-based framework.
