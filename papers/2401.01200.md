## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Skin cancer diagnosis using only visual inspection is challenging and prone to errors. Methods to complement visual diagnosis are needed.
- Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy can provide additional information about skin lesions to aid diagnosis. However, there are no public datasets of NIR spectra of skin lesions to develop and test algorithms.

Proposed Solution:  
- Collected a new dataset (NIR-SC-UFES) of NIR skin lesion spectra spanning the 900-1700nm range, containing 971 total samples from 6 common lesion types (MEL, BCC, SCC, NEV, ACK, SEK).
- Investigated machine learning algorithms XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, 1D-CNN and standard chemometrics algorithms SVM and PLS-DA to classify cancer vs non-cancer lesions using the spectra.
- Tested on raw and pre-processed data (SNV normalization and feature extraction) as well as SMOTE and GAN oversampling due to class imbalance.

Main Contributions:
- First public dataset of NIR spectral data on skin lesions acquired in-vivo. Previous works relied on private datasets.  
- Extensive benchmark showing LightGBM achieved highest balanced accuracy of 0.839 using SNV, feature extraction and GAN oversampling, indicating potential usefulness of NIR spectroscopy for skin lesion classification.
- Analysis highlighted important spectral regions and features for classification between 900-1000nm.
- Results represent first steps towards building computer-aided diagnostic systems for skin cancer screening using NIR spectroscopy.

In summary, the key innovation is the creation of the first public NIR spectral dataset on skin lesions. This enabled testing modern ML algorithms which show promising accuracy, demonstrating feasibility of using NIR spectroscopy to aid skin cancer screening.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the performance of machine and deep learning algorithms on a new dataset of near-infrared skin spectroscopy for automated skin cancer diagnosis, finding that LightGBM with preprocessing achieved the best balanced accuracy of 0.839.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Introduction of a new dataset named NIR-SC-UFES composed of near-infrared (NIR) spectral samples of the most common skin lesions collected in vivo. This is the first publicly available dataset of NIR spectra for skin lesions. 

2) Application and comparison of advanced machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and 1D convolutional neural networks on the skin lesion classification task using the new NIR dataset. Additionally, standard chemometrics algorithms like SVM and PLS-DA were also tested.

3) Investigation of different data pre-processing and augmentation techniques like standard normal variate (SNV) transformation, manual feature extraction, SMOTE oversampling, and GAN-based oversampling to deal with the class imbalance and limited data.

4) Achieving the best performance with LightGBM using SNV pre-processing, manual feature extraction, and GAN-based oversampling, with a balanced accuracy of 0.839. The wavelength range of 939-994 nm was found to be the most important using SHAP analysis.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and analysis of the first public NIR spectral dataset for skin lesions using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
