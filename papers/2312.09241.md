# [TinyGSM: achieving &gt;80% on GSM8k with small language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09241)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method for enabling small language models to achieve strong performance on the challenging GSM8K grade school math word problem benchmark. The key ideas are: (1) generate a high-quality synthetic dataset called TinyGSM containing 12.3 million GSM8K-style math problems paired with Python solutions; this is produced by GPT-3.5. (2) Finetune small LMs (125M to 1.3B parameters) on TinyGSM, allowing even the 125M model to reach 63% on GSM8K. (3) Further boost performance by using a separate small verifier model to score multiple candidate solutions and select the best one. This allows their 1.3B model to achieve 81.5% on GSM8K, competitive with models orders of magnitude larger. The quality of TinyGSM and the effectiveness of the verifier model are the main drivers of the strong results. The work demonstrates the promise of small LMs, high-quality synthetic datasets, and verification mechanisms for advancing mathematical reasoning.
