# [TinyGSM: achieving &gt;80% on GSM8k with small language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09241)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method for enabling small language models to achieve strong performance on the challenging GSM8K grade school math word problem benchmark. The key ideas are: (1) generate a high-quality synthetic dataset called TinyGSM containing 12.3 million GSM8K-style math problems paired with Python solutions; this is produced by GPT-3.5. (2) Finetune small LMs (125M to 1.3B parameters) on TinyGSM, allowing even the 125M model to reach 63% on GSM8K. (3) Further boost performance by using a separate small verifier model to score multiple candidate solutions and select the best one. This allows their 1.3B model to achieve 81.5% on GSM8K, competitive with models orders of magnitude larger. The quality of TinyGSM and the effectiveness of the verifier model are the main drivers of the strong results. The work demonstrates the promise of small LMs, high-quality synthetic datasets, and verification mechanisms for advancing mathematical reasoning.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Small language models (SLMs) are computationally more efficient, but it remains unclear how capable they are at mathematical reasoning compared to large language models (LLMs). Breaking the 80% accuracy barrier on the challenging GSM8K math word problem benchmark has so far required models with at least 34B parameters.

Proposed Solution 
- Introduce TinyGSM, a new high-quality synthetic dataset of 12.3M math word problems and Python solutions generated fully by GPT-3.5.
- Finetune 125M to 1.3B parameter SLMs on TinyGSM, with the 1.3B model reaching 68.2% GSM8K accuracy. 
- Further boost performance by using a separate verifier model to score multiple candidate solutions and select the best one. This allows the 1.3B model to reach 81.5% accuracy, surpassing all existing open-source models under 100B parameters.

Key Contributions
- TinyGSM dataset for training SLMs on math word problems.
- State-of-the-art 81.5% GSM8K accuracy using an ensemble of 1.3B generation model and 1.3B verifier model. 
- Analysis showing verifier model size matters more than generation model size, and that data diversity is crucial to verifier performance.
- Evidence that with a high-quality dataset and verification, SLMs can match or exceed the capabilities of the much larger models they learn from.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces TinyGSM, a synthetic dataset of grade school math word problems generated by GPT-3.5, and shows that finetuning small 125M-1.3B models on this dataset, combined with a verifier model to select answers, allows them to exceed 80% accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark, rivaling the teacher model's 77.4% performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing TinyGSM, a synthetic dataset of 12.3 million grade school math word problems and their Python solutions, generated by GPT-3.5. This high-quality dataset allows small language models to achieve significantly improved performance on the GSM8K benchmark.

2. Demonstrating the effectiveness of using a separate verifier model to score and select the best answer from multiple candidate generations. By using a 1.3B generator + 1.3B verifier, the authors achieve 81.5% on GSM8K, exceeding the accuracy of the GPT-3.5 teacher model and setting a new SOTA for billion-parameter-scale models.

3. Analysis showing that scaling up the verifier model leads to higher gains than scaling up the generator model. So given a fixed parameter budget, allocating more to the verifier is more impactful.

4. Achieving SOTA performance on GSM8K using models that are orders of magnitude smaller than prior art, demonstrating the promise of small language models. The simplicity of the approach also enables efficient training and inference.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper mentions that the TinyGSM dataset was generated using GPT-3.5-turbo. What specific prompt engineering strategies were used to encourage diversity in the generated problems? How might further prompt engineering help improve the quality and diversity of the synthetic dataset?

2) The paper finds that using a separate verifier model to score candidate solutions helps boost performance significantly. What are some ways the verifier training could be improved - for example, by providing better supervision signals beyond just the final answer? 

3) The verifier model seems surprisingly effective given that verification should intuitively be an easier task than generation. What might explain this counterintuitive finding? Are there connections to other domains like GAN training?

4) The paper identifies data diversity as crucial for an effective verifier. What other factors besides checkpoint diversity and temperature could further improve diversity? How can we measure and quantify diversity?

5) The results show the verifier model size has a bigger impact than the generator size. What architectural modifications like attention mechanisms might better take advantage of the verifier's parameters?

6) The paper uses Python code solutions which helps avoid numerical calculation issues. Would training and testing on natural language solutions instead provide complementary signals? How can both formats be combined effectively?

7) What other strategies besides using a verifier could help bridge the performance gap between the teacher and student models? For example, would iterative refinement be viable for small models?

8) The paper focuses on mathematical reasoning, but how well would the approach transfer to other reasoning tasks like commonsense reasoning? What adaptations would be required?

9) Beyond accuracy, how do the model generations qualitatively compare to human-written solutions? What analysis could shed light on the model's understanding?

10) The paper establishes new SotA results for GSM8K among small models. What further benchmarking on other math word problem datasets could better assess robustness?
