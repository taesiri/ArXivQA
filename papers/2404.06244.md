# [Anchor-based Robust Finetuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Finetuning vision-language models like CLIP on downstream tasks often leads to a degradation of their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities, which includes performance on domain shift (e.g. sketches) and zero-shot learning. The key reason identified is that the finetuning target only uses class labels as supervision ("a photo of a cat"), which is much simpler than the rich text descriptions used during pretraining. This causes the image features to collapse towards class centers, losing their original semantics.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Anchor-based Robust Finetuning (ARF) approach to regularize finetuning using two auxiliary anchors:

1) Text-Compensated Anchor: A pretrained image caption model generates descriptive captions for finetune images. Contrastive loss aligns images and captions, compensating for loss of semantics.

2) Image-Text Anchor: Additional image-text pairs are retrieved from a dataset similar to CLIP's pretraining data, related to the downstream task. Contrastive loss preserves CLIP's original feature space.

These two anchors provide rich semantic supervision to maintain OOD capabilities during finetuning.

Main Contributions:
- Extends robust finetuning to preserve both domain shift and zero-shot generalization, a more challenging setting. 
- Proposes ARF method using text-compensated and retrieved image-text anchors to regularize finetuning.
- Achieves new SOTA results on domain shift and zero-shot benchmarks while matching in-distribution accuracy.

In summary, the paper identifies the cause of degraded OOD performance after finetuning CLIP models, and uses semantic-rich auxiliary anchors to effectively address this problem.
