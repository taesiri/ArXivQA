# [EmphAssess : a Prosodic Benchmark on Assessing Emphasis Transfer in   Speech-to-Speech Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating prosody, especially emphasis (perceived importance of words/phrases), is critical for speech models but lacks robust metrics. This is especially challenging for speech-to-speech (S2S) models like speech resynthesis and speech-to-speech translation.
- Existing emphasis evaluation relies on human judgement or matches input-output word emphasis in a single "gold" translation. This is subjective, costly, not reproducible, and can't handle variations like paraphrasing. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce EmphAssess - an automatic benchmark to evaluate emphasis transfer in S2S models. It has:
  - EmphAssess dataset: 3,652 English speech samples with emphasis annotations
  - Evaluation pipeline: Generates model outputs then compares input vs output emphasis
  - Emphasis classifier (EmphaClass): New model to classify emphasis in speech

- Pipeline detects emphasis words in output with classifier, aligns them to input words, and computes precision, recall and F1 scores. Handles variations like paraphrasing/translation.

- EmphaClass leverages pretrained multilingual SSL model, finetuned on English emphasis data. Shows good accuracy and potential for cross-language generalization.

Main Contributions:
- First automatic emphasis evaluation benchmark for S2S models that works across languages and output variations
- Modular pipeline design allows upgrades and integration of better modules
- Introduce and open-source EmphaClass emphasis classifier with encouraging accuracy and multilinguality
- Benchmark results for latest S2S models showing which effectively preserve emphasis
- Framework and classifier lay groundwork for emphasis evaluation in other languages  

The paper introduces an important benchmark to advance prosody evaluation in speech models, especially emphasis transfer in S2S systems. The pipeline, dataset and classifier enable standardized assessment across languages and model outputs. Key results provide insights into current model capabilities. The work helps progress speech modelling expressivity.
