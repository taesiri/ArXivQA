# [AI-Enhanced Virtual Reality in Medicine: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03093)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "AI-Enhanced Virtual Reality in Medicine: A Comprehensive Survey":

Problem:
Virtual reality (VR) technology, aided by artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a dominant interaction media in medicine, thanks to its ability to provide immersive experiences. However, there lacks a systematic examination and taxonomy of AI-enhanced VR techniques and applications tailored for the medical domain. 

Solution:
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the burgeoning field of AI-powered VR applications in medicine. The authors introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these techniques and applications into three distinct categories:

1. Visualization Enhancement: Focuses on augmenting the user's visual and sensory perception within a virtual space through virtual reconstruction and visual enhancement. This allows better understanding of intricate anatomical structures.  

2. VR-related Medical Data Analytics: Addresses the advanced capabilities of VR systems to analyze medical data through structural/lesion analysis, disease diagnosis, and surgical support. Transforms traditional 2D data usage to more dynamic 3D analytical approaches.

3. VR-assisted Intervention: Covers the utilization of VR technologies to directly provide guidance in interventions and deliver context-aware feedback through intra-operative assistance and interactive collaboration.

Main Contributions:

- First systematic taxonomy and survey of AI-enhanced VR in medicine that lays the foundation for future research in this interdisciplinary domain.

- Comprehensive analysis of the diverse roles of AI-powered VR in visualization, data analytics, interventions across the spectrum of medical diagnosis and treatment.

- Exploration of potential future trajectories of AI-VR in medicine, considering technological, ethical, legal and practical implications.

- Valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of AI, VR and medicine.

In summary, this paper offers an extensive examination of the state-of-the-art in AI-driven VR techniques tailored for medicine, facilitated through a well-defined taxonomy. The structured analysis also reveals existing research gaps, inspiring future work.
