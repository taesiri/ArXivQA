# [Limits to classification performance by relating Kullback-Leibler   divergence to Cohen's Kappa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning classification algorithms are evaluated based on performance metrics like accuracy estimated from training data. However, these do not prove the algorithm has achieved the best possible performance for the underlying data distributions.
- The goal is to relate the algorithm's performance to fundamental limits set by information-theoretic divergence measures between the class distributions. This allows assessing if the algorithm's performance is optimal.

Methodology:
- Formulate the confusion matrix to comply with the Chernoff-Stein lemma linking error rates to Kullback-Leibler divergence. 
- Derive a relationship between Cohen's Kappa (classification performance metric) and the Resistor Average Distance (information divergence measure).
- Estimate information divergences from training data independently using a kNN method. These allow predicting best achievable performance.
- Compare actual algorithm performance (Kappa) to expected performance based on divergences to see if algorithm is optimal.

Key Results:
- Showed Cohen's Kappa is approximately 1 - 2^(-R) where R is the Resistor Average Distance between class distributions. This relates classification performance to information divergence.
- Methodology worked well on simulated and real datasets with varying numbers of dimensions, discrete/continuous variables and class imbalance.
- For all datasets, actual performance matched expected optimal performance based on divergences, proving algorithms achieved best possible performance.
- For coronary heart disease data, methodology showed performance is limited by data itself, not the algorithm.

Conclusions:
- Proposed methodology successfully relates classification algorithm performance to information-theoretic limits set by divergences between distributions.
- Allows assessing if algorithm performance is optimal or if data limits performance.
- Performance ultimately depends on data quality and variable relevance, not just algorithm sophistication.
