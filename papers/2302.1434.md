# [Inference in Non-stationary High-Dimensional VARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.1434)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to construct an inferential procedure for Granger causality in high-dimensional non-stationary vector autoregressive (VAR) models. More specifically, the authors aim to develop a method for testing Granger causality that does not require knowing the order of integration of the time series in the VAR model. The key points are:- Granger causality testing is an important tool in time series analysis with many applications, but standard methods require knowing if the data is stationary/integrated. This is problematic as unit root and integration tests can be ambiguous.- The authors propose a method combining lag augmentation (to avoid issues with non-stationarity) with a post-double selection procedure (to enable high-dimensional inference). - Lag augmentation is done only for the variable being tested as Granger causing, making the approach feasible in high dimensions.- Post-double selection controls for omitted variables and prevents spurious regression, ensuring valid inference.- Theoretical results show the resulting tests have asymptotic chi-squared distributions under the null, irrespective of integration properties.- Simulations and an empirical application highlight good finite sample performance.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed lag-augmented post-double selection method will provide a way to perform valid Granger causality testing in high dimensions without requiring knowledge of the integration properties of the data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models that does not require knowing the integration/cointegration properties of the time series. The key aspects are:- They use a lag augmentation approach based on Toda and Yamamoto (1995) where extra lags of the Granger causing variables are added. This provides asymptotic normality of the least squares estimators regardless of unit roots. - They modify this approach by only augmenting the Granger causing variables, making it feasible for high-dimensional VARs. - They combine lag augmentation with a post-double selection procedure to perform variable selection while guarding against omitted variable bias. - They show that the resulting post-selection OLS estimator is asymptotically normal uniformly over the parameter space, allowing for valid chi-squared inference.- This provides a framework for Granger causality testing that is robust to unknown integration/cointegration properties of the data, avoiding issues with pre-testing and transformations.- They provide conditions on sparsity, empirical process bounds, and restricted eigenvalues to establish the theorems.- Finite sample performance is evaluated through simulations, and the method is applied to investigating the causes and effects of economic uncertainty.In summary, the main contribution is a method for high-dimensional Granger causality testing that is robust to nonstationarity, removing the need for pre-testing or transformations of the data. This provides a practically useful framework for applied researchers working with many time series.
