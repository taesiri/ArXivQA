# [Inference in Non-stationary High-Dimensional VARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.1434)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to construct an inferential procedure for Granger causality in high-dimensional non-stationary vector autoregressive (VAR) models. More specifically, the authors aim to develop a method for testing Granger causality that does not require knowing the order of integration of the time series in the VAR model. The key points are:- Granger causality testing is an important tool in time series analysis with many applications, but standard methods require knowing if the data is stationary/integrated. This is problematic as unit root and integration tests can be ambiguous.- The authors propose a method combining lag augmentation (to avoid issues with non-stationarity) with a post-double selection procedure (to enable high-dimensional inference). - Lag augmentation is done only for the variable being tested as Granger causing, making the approach feasible in high dimensions.- Post-double selection controls for omitted variables and prevents spurious regression, ensuring valid inference.- Theoretical results show the resulting tests have asymptotic chi-squared distributions under the null, irrespective of integration properties.- Simulations and an empirical application highlight good finite sample performance.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed lag-augmented post-double selection method will provide a way to perform valid Granger causality testing in high dimensions without requiring knowledge of the integration properties of the data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models that does not require knowing the integration/cointegration properties of the time series. The key aspects are:- They use a lag augmentation approach based on Toda and Yamamoto (1995) where extra lags of the Granger causing variables are added. This provides asymptotic normality of the least squares estimators regardless of unit roots. - They modify this approach by only augmenting the Granger causing variables, making it feasible for high-dimensional VARs. - They combine lag augmentation with a post-double selection procedure to perform variable selection while guarding against omitted variable bias. - They show that the resulting post-selection OLS estimator is asymptotically normal uniformly over the parameter space, allowing for valid chi-squared inference.- This provides a framework for Granger causality testing that is robust to unknown integration/cointegration properties of the data, avoiding issues with pre-testing and transformations.- They provide conditions on sparsity, empirical process bounds, and restricted eigenvalues to establish the theorems.- Finite sample performance is evaluated through simulations, and the method is applied to investigating the causes and effects of economic uncertainty.In summary, the main contribution is a method for high-dimensional Granger causality testing that is robust to nonstationarity, removing the need for pre-testing or transformations of the data. This provides a practically useful framework for applied researchers working with many time series.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional vector autoregressive models that allows for unknown orders of integration in the time series by augmenting the lag length of only the variables being tested as Granger causing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several important contributions to the literature on Granger causality testing in high-dimensional time series models:- It proposes a new method for testing Granger causality that does not require pre-testing or knowledge of the integration/cointegration properties of the time series. This is accomplished through lag augmentation of the Granger causing variables, adapting the approach of Toda and Yamamoto (1995). - The paper shows how lag augmentation can be restricted only to the variables being tested for Granger causality. This makes the approach feasible in a high-dimensional setting, unlike previous methods that augmented lags of all variables.- The paper combines lag augmentation with the post-double selection method of Belloni et al. (2014) to achieve valid post-selection inference. It appropriately modifies the procedure to prevent spurious regression with integrated processes.- Uniform asymptotic normality of the post-selection OLS estimator is proven, establishing that standard chi-squared tests can be used for Granger causality in this framework. This holds irrespective of the presence of unit roots or cointegration.- The paper provides practical recommendations for choosing the lag length and augmentation order in finite samples. It also proposes a method to data-driven estimate the lag length based on individual autoregressions.Overall, this paper makes a significant methodological contribution by developing a Granger causality testing procedure that is robust to nonstationarity and applicable in high dimensions. This allows investigating Granger causal relationships in large datasets without requiring pre-testing or transformations. Compared to other related papers like Hecq et al. (2021), this paper is the first to consider Granger causality testing under unknown integration/cointegration orders in a high-dimensional VAR model. The lag augmentation restricts the parameter proliferation which enables feasible estimation. The adaptation of the post-double selection procedure is also novel. Overall, this paper nicely complements the existing literature on regularization methods for high-dimensional VARs and causality testing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the method to allow for Granger causality testing between multiple variables or blocks of variables, rather than just the bivariate causality relations considered in the paper. The authors note this would require more involved notation and algebra but should be possible.- Investigating the use of other variable/model selection methods besides the lasso in the initial selection steps. The lasso could potentially be replaced by other sparsity-inducing estimators.- Considering ways to relax the exact sparsity assumption to approximate or weak sparsity. The current theoretical results rely on exact sparsity but the authors note approximations may be possible.- Developing heteroskedasticity-robust versions of the tests, for instance using Eicker-White standard errors or modifying the LM test. This is noted to be straightforward based on existing methods.- Deriving theoretical results allowing for a growing number of relevant variables, rather than the fixed/finite number currently assumed. This may require Gaussian approximation theorems or other tools to extend the results.- Further investigating the choice of augmentation lag length $d$, in particular whether a higher $d$ than the $d=2$ recommended may be beneficial.- Considering data-driven ways to select both the VAR lag order $p$ and augmentation order $d$, rather than just $p$ as currently done.- Evaluating the finite sample performance of the method more extensively across wider range of data generating processes.So in summary, the main suggestions involve extending the theoretical results to relax assumptions, broadening the methodology to wider settings, and deeper investigation into practical implementation issues such as lag selection and performance evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper develops a method for testing Granger causality in high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models where the time series may contain unit roots. The key idea is to augment the VAR with additional lags of the variables being tested for Granger causality. This allows the variables to 'difference themselves' to the appropriate order, circumventing issues with nonstationarity. The method is combined with a post-double selection approach to allow application in high dimensions. Theoretical results are provided showing the uniform validity of the resulting tests. Simulations demonstrate good finite sample properties. An empirical application investigates the causes and effects of economic uncertainty, illustrating the importance of avoiding transformations to achieve stationarity which may remove predictive information. Overall, the paper provides a method to perform valid inference on Granger causality relations between potentially nonstationary variables in high-dimensional VAR models.
