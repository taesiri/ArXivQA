# [Fairness of Exposure in Online Restless Multi-armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06348)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Fairness of Exposure in Online Restless Multi-armed Bandits":

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of fairness in online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs). In RMABs, there are multiple arms (e.g. representing patients) with unknown Markovian dynamics. At each time step, only a subset of arms can be intervened on (pulled) due to limited resources. Existing approaches focus only on reward maximization, which results in optimal policies completely ignoring certain arms. However, in public health applications, it is important to provide unbiased intervention opportunities across all patients. Hence, there is a need for fair online RMAB algorithms. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel fairness notion called "\ourfair" which provides intervention opportunities to each arm proportional to its "merit". The merit of an arm is defined as the difference in steady-state distribution of the arm being in a good state when the arm is always pulled versus never pulled. This indicates the arm's long-term benefit from intervention. 

The paper presents an algorithm "\ouralgo" which maintains confidence bounds on transition probabilities, estimates arm merits optimistically, and pulls arms proportional to merit. For single pulls, it provides the first sub-linear fairness regret bound of O(âˆšTlogT) for online fair RMABs.

Main Contributions:
- Extends the notion of exposure fairness to online RMAB setting as \ourfair
- Proposes algorithm \ouralgo\ and proves sub-linear fairness regret bound for single pulls
- Empirically validates \ouralgo\ on synthetic and real-world health datasets with both single and multiple pulls
- First work to provide theoretical fairness guarantees in online RMAB setting

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards fair decision making in online restless bandits, with applications in public health and beyond. The proposed fairness notion and algorithm provide a principled way to balance fairness and learning in unknown restless environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel online restless multi-armed bandit algorithm called MF-RMAB that achieves sublinear fairness regret by ensuring each arm is pulled in proportion to its steady-state reward merit.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It extends the exposure fairness notion of Wang et al. (2021) to an online restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) setting. 

2) It provides a sublinear bound on fairness regret when only one arm is pulled in each round and shows that the proposed algorithm called \ouralgo performs well empirically in the multi-pull case as well.

3) It validates the efficacy of \ouralgo on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that it incurs sublinear fairness regret while the optimal policy exhibits linear regret.

In summary, this paper proposes a new online algorithm for fair RMABs, provides theoretical analysis for the single-pull case, and demonstrates good experimental performance on both single-pull and multi-pull scenarios. The main novelty lies in introducing and analyzing exposure fairness in an online RMAB setting.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs): A class of multi-armed bandits where each arm has an associated Markov decision process with its own states, actions, transition dynamics, and rewards.

- Online learning: The setting where the transition dynamics of the RMAB arms are unknown and must be learned over time.

- Fairness: Providing a fair distribution of pulls across arms rather than focusing only on optimal arms. Key fairness notions explored are meritocratic fairness and fairness of exposure. 

- Regret: A metric that measures the difference between the learned policy and the optimal fair policy. Key regrets analyzed are fairness regret and reward regret.

- Merit function: A function that maps the reward of an arm to a positive value representing its "goodness". Used to define meritocratic fairness.

- Confidence bounds: Used to maintain optimistic estimates of the unknown transition probabilities during online learning.

So in summary, the key things this paper focuses on are online learning of fair policies for restless bandits using notions like meritocratic fairness, confidence bounds, and analyzing the fairness regret.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper defines the reward of an arm based on the difference in steady-state probabilities of being in a good state when the arm is always pulled versus never pulled. What is the intuition behind using this difference as the reward? How would using just the steady-state probability of being in a good state change the properties of the proposed algorithm?

2. The paper assumes the transition matrices of the arms are non-degenerate, meaning there is always a non-zero probability of transitioning to any state. Why is this assumption important? How would degenerate transitions impact the analysis? 

3. The paper defines fairness regret based on the difference between the optimal fair policy and the learned policy. What other ways of quantifying fairness regret could you think of? What are the tradeoffs of using different fairness regret definitions?

4. Could you extend the exposure fairness notion to scenarios where the merit function is unknown and needs to be learned? What kinds of assumptions would you need? How would the regret bounds change in this setting?

5. The paper primarily focuses on single-arm pulls due to challenges in extending merit-based fairness notions to multiple pulls. Can you think of ways to extend the fairness guarantee to multi-pull settings with approximate or weakened fairness guarantees?  

6. How does the time horizon H impact the efficiency of learning and convergence to steady-state probabilities? What is the tradeoff in choosing small versus large values of H?

7. The confidence bounds used for learning transition probabilities play an important role. Can you think of other ways to construct confidence sets? What properties would they need to satisfy?

8. The regret bounds have dependence on various problem-dependent constants. What do these constants signify? Can better bounds be achieved by making additional assumptions?

9. The paper assumes that the merit function is Lipschitz continuous. Why is this assumption needed? How does relaxing this change the nature of the theoretical guarantees? 

10. The experiments are performed on synthetic and real-world health datasets. What other application domains could this method be useful for? What adaptations would be needed?
