# [Rethinking Search: Making Domain Experts out of Dilettantes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02274)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can ideas from classical information retrieval and recent advances in pre-trained language models be synthesized to create next-generation information retrieval systems that can provide high-quality, human expert-like responses to user information needs?

The key ideas and components to address this question include:

- Moving from language models to "corpus models" that jointly model term-term, term-document, and document-document relationships. This allows retrieving documents directly from the model without a separate index.

- Using the model in a multi-task setting for various IR tasks like retrieval, question answering, summarization, etc. This allows one consolidated model to handle many tasks. 

- Leveraging the model's ability for zero-shot and few-shot learning to adapt it to new tasks and corpora with limited labeled data.

- Generating high-quality responses by ensuring they are authoritative, unbiased, transparent, diverse, accessible, etc.

- Adding capabilities like reasoning, multiple modalities, multiple languages, leveraging document structure, etc. to enhance the model.

- Replacing the traditional "index-retrieve-rank" paradigm with a single consolidated model that encodes all corpus knowledge.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that synthesizing classical IR and modern language models can produce IR systems with much greater capabilities compared to what exists today. The paper outlines a research agenda for achieving this vision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new "model-based" paradigm for information retrieval that moves beyond the traditional "index-retrieve-then-rank" approach. The key ideas are:

- Replacing indexes with a consolidated pre-trained model that encodes all the knowledge in a corpus. This eliminates the distinction between retrieval and ranking.

- Using the model for a wide range of IR tasks via multi-task learning. The same model can do document retrieval, question answering, summarization, etc. 

- Leveraging the model's ability to generalize with little labeled data to adapt to new tasks and corpora via zero-shot and few-shot learning.

- Synthesizing high quality, "domain expert" responses by making connections between terms and documents explicit in the model. This allows citing sources and evidence for answers.

- Overcoming limitations of current pre-trained language models that are "dilettantes" with only superficial knowledge. The proposed model would have much deeper knowledge and understanding of documents and the corpus.

In summary, the paper proposes a new way of thinking about IR systems by consolidating everything into a single pre-trained model. This has the potential to significantly advance IR capabilities if the research challenges around training, scalability, response generation quality, etc. can be addressed.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a new model-based approach to information retrieval that replaces traditional indexing and separate retrieval/ranking stages with a single consolidated neural model trained directly on the corpus. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in pre-trained language models and multi-task learning to create an end-to-end neural IR system that encodes all knowledge about the corpus and can solve a wide range of IR tasks in a unified manner.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a vision for a new paradigm of information retrieval systems based on large pre-trained language models. Here are some key points on how it compares to other related work:

- It proposes moving away from the traditional "index-retrieve-then-rank" paradigm that has been dominant in IR for decades. Instead, it advocates for a consolidated model-based approach that replaces indexing and retrieval with model training and inference. This is a significant departure from most prior IR research.

- The envisioned system would leverage recent advances in pre-trained language models and multi-task learning to handle a wide range of IR tasks in a unified framework. This builds upon previous work using neural models for ranking, but takes it a step further by consolidating multiple tasks into one model.

- A key goal is generating high quality, human expert-like responses, with supporting evidence and citations. This goes beyond most question answering and summarization systems today which lack deep semantic understanding and reasoning.

- The proposal explores research directions like incremental learning, multi-modality, and interpretability that aim to make such model-based IR systems practical. Most prior work has not addressed the systems building and engineering challenges to the same degree.

Overall, the paper presents an ambitious vision for transforming IR using modern NLP that, if realized, could enable significantly more capable systems. It tackles longstanding challenges around semantic search and reasoning in a novel way compared to incremental extensions of traditional IR models. The proposed research agenda could catalyze new cross-disciplinary work spanning IR, NLP, and ML.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing "corpus models" that go beyond standard language models by modeling relationships between terms, documents, and document metadata. This includes challenges like representing document identifiers and pre-training objectives.

- Using multi-task learning to enable a single consolidated model to handle various IR tasks like retrieval, question answering, summarization, etc. This involves task conditioning and careful definition of pre-training and fine-tuning. 

- Leveraging zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities of large pre-trained models to enable generalization with limited labeled data.

- Generating high quality responses that are authoritative, unbiased, transparent, diverse, and accessible. This presents challenges around evaluation, bias mitigation, explainability, etc.

- Incorporating reasoning capabilities through modular components like memory networks or multi-hop architectures.

- Handling multiple modalities, languages, document structures, and corpus structures within a single consolidated model.

- Scaling model capacity, training data size, and inference to handle web-scale corpora. Approaches like conditional computation and distillation may help.

- Enabling incremental learning to handle corpus updates without catastrophic forgetting.

- Improving model interpretability, controllability and robustness compared to neural models today.

In summary, the authors lay out an ambitious research agenda to bridge IR and NLP via consolidated corpus models that can provide domain expert quality assistance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new model-based approach to information retrieval that eliminates the distinction between retrieval and ranking. Rather than relying on an inverted index for retrieval followed by machine learned models for ranking, the paper advocates for consolidating everything into a single pre-trained neural model. This consolidated model encodes all of the information in the corpus and can be used directly to generate responses for queries across a diverse range of tasks. The model incorporates aspects of classical information retrieval systems, modern neural ranking models, and pre-trained language models. Key research challenges include developing corpus-level language models, leveraging multi-task learning, few-shot adaptation, reasoning capabilities, interpretability, and scalability. If successful, such model-based information retrieval systems have the potential to provide more coherent, authoritative, and nuanced responses compared to current systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper envisions a new approach to information retrieval that moves beyond traditional search engines and aims to provide responses of the same quality as human domain experts. The key idea is to replace the traditional "index-retrieve-then-rank" paradigm with a consolidated model that encodes all the knowledge in the corpus. This model would replace indexes and seamlessly handle retrieval and ranking. The model would be pre-trained and support multi-task learning, allowing it to handle many different IR tasks like retrieval, question answering, and summarization. The model could also leverage few-shot learning to quickly adapt to new tasks and corpora. An important capability is the ability to generate high quality responses, with features like authoritativeness, transparency, lack of bias, and diverse perspectives. There are many research challenges, including developing the right modeling approaches, training techniques, and scalability solutions. If successful, this new approach would enable search systems to finally deliver on the promise of providing true expert-level assistance.

In summary, the paper lays out an ambitious vision for a new generation of IR systems. It proposes replacing traditional search components like indexes and ranking models with a single consolidated neural model. This model would encode all knowledge in the corpus and directly answer user needs, with the quality of a human expert. Realizing this vision will require innovative solutions to modeling, training, generating responses, and scalability. The payoff would be search engines that understand users and provide expert-level help.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a model-based information retrieval framework that replaces the traditional index-retrieve-then-rank paradigm. The key idea is to train a consolidated corpus model on the documents in a corpus, encoding all the knowledge in the corpus in the parameters of the model. This consolidated model eliminates the need for building indexes and separates retrieval from ranking. Instead, a single model can be used for a wide range of IR tasks including retrieval, ranking, question answering, summarization etc via multi-task learning. The model jointly represents terms, documents and their associations, allowing it to retrieve documents directly given a query without needing a separate retrieval step. By leveraging recent advances in pre-trained language models and multi-task learning, the model can adapt to new tasks with little labeled data. The end goal is to build IR systems that can provide high quality, authoritative and unbiased responses, going beyond what current search engines and QA systems can offer.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is envisioning a new approach to information retrieval (IR) systems that aims to provide responses of "domain expert" quality. The key problems and questions it addresses are:

- Classical IR systems return lists of potentially relevant documents, but do not provide direct answers to users' information needs. Question answering systems offer limited coverage or rely on human editors. How can an IR system provide high quality, comprehensive, authoritative answers to users?

- Modern IR systems rely on an index-retrieve-then-rank paradigm. Could this paradigm be rethought and replaced with a consolidated model that encodes all knowledge about the corpus? 

- Pre-trained language models (LMs) like BERT have revolutionized NLP, but they operate on the term level and lack document understanding. How can techniques from IR and pre-trained LMs be combined into new "corpus models"?

- Can a single consolidated model be trained to handle multiple IR tasks like retrieval, QA, summarization etc. via multi-task learning? What are the challenges in scaling such a model?

- How can an IR system generate high quality responses that are authoritative, transparent about provenance, unbiased, cover diverse perspectives, and are accessible to users?

- What optimizations like incremental learning are needed to handle dynamic corpora where new documents are constantly added?

In summary, the key focus is on rethinking core assumptions of modern IR systems like the separation of retrieval and ranking, and envisioning a new consolidated model approach that can provide domain expert quality responses by combining strengths of IR and large pre-trained LMs.
