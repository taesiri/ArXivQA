# [Which Model to Transfer? A Survey on Transferability Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15231)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Which Model to Transfer? A Survey on Transferability Estimation":

Problem:
With the increasing availability of pre-trained models, selecting the most suitable pre-trained model for a given downstream target task has become critical. However, individually fine-tuning each candidate model on the target task to evaluate suitability is computationally expensive. Model transferability estimation (MTE) aims to efficiently predict how well a pre-trained model will perform on a target task after transfer learning, without needing to actually fine-tune the model.

Proposed Solution:
This paper surveys recent advances in MTE and categorizes them into two realms:

1. Source-free MTE: Methods predict transferability using only the model and target data, without access to source data used to pre-train the models. These are further divided into static methods that directly compute scores from model outputs on target data, and dynamic methods that use transformations or learning frameworks.

2. Source-dependent MTE: Methods utilize the source dataset to estimate transferability, typically by measuring distribution gaps between source and target data. These are also categorized into static and dynamic approaches.

For both realms, the paper provides a taxonomy of methods based on techniques used, evaluates commonly used metrics, summarizes experimental settings and applications, and discusses evaluation studies.

Main Contributions:
- First survey to systematically review two distinct subfields of transferability estimation: source-free and source-dependent MTE
- Proposes a novel taxonomy to categorize existing methods under each realm
- Discusses evaluation protocols, highlights applications beyond computer vision, and points to emerging trends
- Summarizes prior comparative evaluation studies and outlines open problems to guide future research

Overall, this paper offers a holistic understanding of the current landscape and challenges in estimating model transferability for transfer learning. The proposed taxonomy and analysis provide a helpful guide for novice and experienced researchers in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of methods for efficiently estimating the suitability of source models for downstream tasks without full training, categorizing them into source-free and source-dependent approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of the emerging research area of model transferability estimation (MTE). Its main contributions include:

1) Systematically overviews two distinct topics in transferability estimation: source-free model transferability estimation (SF-MTE) and source-dependent model transferability estimation (SD-MTE). 

2) Introduces a novel taxonomy of existing MTE methods and provides clear definitions for each topic, hoping to aid readers in developing a better understanding of the advancements in each area.

3) Provides an outlook of recent emerging trends and unresolved problems, offering insights into potential future research directions in MTE.

In summary, this survey paper categorizes, reviews, and discusses the current progress in estimating the suitability of source models for target tasks without extensive fine-tuning, known as model transferability estimation. It is the first survey providing a structured overview of this growing research field.
