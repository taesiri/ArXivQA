# [Not As Easy As You Think -- Experiences and Lessons Learnt from Trying   to Create a Bottom-Up Visualization Image Typology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07533)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 

The paper aims to develop a typology and characterization of visualization images published in IEEE Visualization (VIS) papers over the past 30 years. Categorizing visualization techniques is useful for systematically studying the field, ensuring coverage in overviews, identifying outliers, and structuring discussions. However, existing categorizations focus on how visualizations are constructed based on data types, tasks, or encoding rules rather than on the visual appearance of the end result. The authors argue that a characterization of the output space of visualizations can provide a complementary viewpoint. Deriving such an image-based typology poses several challenges including the lack of standard visualization definitions, individual differences in interpretation, ambiguity without textual context, and the large number of images.

Approach:

The authors visually analyzed 6,833 figures from 695 IEEE VIS papers in a qualitative coding process over 2 years. They derived a typology with 13 visualization types based on visual characteristic, including bar, point, line, node-link, area, surface/volume, grid/matrix, pattern, color, glyph, and text representations as well as images showing user interfaces and schematics. In addition, images were coded by dimensionality and subjective difficulty. The typology consolidation involved several failed attempts starting from author keywords, visualization techniques, and low-level encodings. The final typology uses high-level categories that account for perceptual similarities.

Results:

The four most common visualization types were schematics (29%), surfaces/volumes (20%), lines (18%), and node-links/graphs (8%). 15% of images showed GUIs and 8% could not be clearly categorized. Images were predominantly 2D with 30% rendered in 3D. Over time, surfaces/volumes decreased while lines and bars increased. The coding consistency between raters varied by visualization type from 35% to 76% with glyphs being most ambiguous. Cases of ambiguity are discussed including, for example, differentiating volumes, areas, maps, and terrains, handling complex multi-encoding images as well as images combining schematics and visualization examples.

Contributions: 

The paper contributes a new characterization of IEEE VIS images over 30 years based on their visual appearance, a dataset of tagged images, quantitative insights into the use of visualizations, and a discussion of limitations and difficulties in deriving an image-based typology. It argues for the value of considering what visualizations look like in addition to how they are constructed. The characterization and data are intended to enable new studies of visualization practices and compare human and computer interpretations.

In summary, the paper provides a high-quality, carefully validated visualization image typology created through extensive qualitative coding and discussions by seven experienced researchers. The difficulties encountered showcase inherent perceptual and contextual ambiguities in interpreting visualization images out of context. The work encourages the community to join the endeavor to refine and apply the proposed characterization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The authors present a typology of 13 visualization image types derived from a qualitative analysis of over 6,800 images published in IEEE Visualization conference papers, discuss the challenges in developing the typology, and provide a dataset and online tool to explore the categorized image collection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A novel typology of visualization images consisting of 13 categories that attempt to capture the diversity of design approaches, rendering methods, algorithms, or viewpoint selections within each category.

2. The coding dataset and quantitative analysis of over 6,800 IEEE VIS (VisWeek) images tagged based on the proposed typology.

3. A discussion of the process, failed attempts, and coding ambiguities encountered in deriving the typology, providing insights into the challenges of categorizing real-world visualization images.

4. An open web-based tool to explore the dataset of tagged images, enabling examination of the diverse visualizations used in the visualization research community.

In summary, the paper presents a new visualization image typology, an analysis of images from IEEE VIS papers based on this typology, reflections on the difficulties of devising such a typology, and a tool to explore the resulting dataset. The goal is to provide a new viewpoint for understanding and classifying the visual artifacts created and published in the visualization research field.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors went through an iterative process over two years to develop the visualization typology. What were some of the key challenges and failures they encountered along the way that led them to revise their approach?

2. The final typology focuses on describing the visual appearance of images rather than the underlying data or construction rules used to create them. Why did the authors ultimately decide this "what we see" approach was more suitable than alternative perspectives? 

3. The authors settled on 13 visualization types in their final typology. What was their rationale for choosing these specific categories and what principles guided their selection process? Were there any visualization types they debated including but ultimately did not?

4. There were still many ambiguous cases when applying the 13 visualization types to code images. Can you discuss some examples of images that were particularly difficult to categorize and why? What heuristics did the coders use when disagreement occurred?

5. The consistency between coders differed substantially based on visualization type. For example, glyph-based representations had relatively low consistency while generalized bar representations had high consistency. What factors may have contributed to these differences?  

6. The authors mention their expertise influenced image coding decisions, especially for schematics. In what ways could more domain knowledge introduce bias? How might this affect the applicability of the typology for non-experts?

7. Multiple visual encodings were a major source of inconsistency. What guidelines did the authors establish for when to code a single versus multiple types for the same image? When is it appropriate to prioritize one encoding over others?

8. The authors quantified proportions of visualization types, dimensions, and difficulty ratings over time. What notable temporal trends did they observe in how the community publishes and communicates research?

9. The online exploration tool enables browsing images by the defined typology. In what ways could this dataset and tool potentially be utilized by the visualization community, both for research and pedagogical purposes? 

10. The authors mention their high-level categorical distinctions relate to the notion of "typicality" in cognitive psychology. Can you elaborate on this connection and why it was relevant to their goal of creating an accessible and useful visualization typology?
