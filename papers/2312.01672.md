# [STADEE: STAtistics-based DEEp Detection of Machine Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01672)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel machine-generated text detection method called STADEE that combines statistical text features extracted by a pre-trained language model (PLM) with a sequence-based deep classifier. STADEE extracts four statistical features from the input text using a PLM - probability, rank, cumulative probability, and information entropy. These features better capture high-level statistical patterns while avoiding overfitting on fine-grained semantic features. The features are consolidated into a tensor preserving sequence information and input to a Transformer-Encoder classifier. Experiments are conducted on three datasets spanning diverse domains and models to assess generalization capability. Results demonstrate STADEE's superior performance over fine-tuning PLMs and traditional statistics-based methods in out-of-domain and in-the-wild settings. The gains highlight STADEE's greater applicability for practical deployment where test conditions differ unpredictably from training. Future work includes exploring additional features and transformations as well as more powerful downstream classifiers.
