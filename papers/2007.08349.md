# [Natural Graph Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08349)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design graph neural networks that are equivariant to global node permutations while using only local computations?

The key points are:

- Traditional graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that aggregate messages from neighbors are only invariant to local node permutations, limiting their expressiveness. 

- Global equivariant graph networks (EGNs) treat the entire graph as a whole, making them computationally expensive. 

- This paper proposes "natural graph networks" that are equivariant to global node permutations but implemented via efficient local computations.

- The key idea is that a global node permutation when restricted to a local neighborhood induces a local isomorphism. So a graph network can be made globally equivariant by constraining the message passing kernels to be equivariant to these local isomorphisms.

- They introduce global and local natural graph networks to capture this idea, with the latter being scalable like GCNs.

- The local natural networks share weights between locally isomorphic neighborhoods and satisfy kernel constraints based on local symmetries. 

- The kernels can be parameterized with a message network, where the kernel constraint arises from the message network being equivariant.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that global equivariance can be achieved via constraints on local message passing, yielding expressive and scalable graph networks. The natural graph network framework formalizes this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework for building graph neural networks called natural graph networks (NGNs). The key ideas are:

- Using the concept of naturality from category theory to construct graph networks that are equivariant to global node permutations but use only local computations. 

- Defining global NGNs where layers satisfy a naturality condition so that isomorphic graphs are processed equivalently.

- Defining local NGNs where message passing kernels satisfy naturality so global equivariance emerges.

- Showing local NGNs generalize previous approaches like graph convolutional networks and covariant compositional networks.

- Giving a parameterization of local NGNs using an equivariant message network, which allows constructing universal and practical NGNs.

- Providing experiments on icosahedral MNIST and graph classification benchmarks showing competitive performance of a NGN model using a simple GCN-based message network.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the NGN framework to get powerful and scalable graph networks based on the concept of naturality from category theory. NGNs open up a broader space of graph networks compared to previous approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the abstract and overview, this paper introduces the concept of natural graph networks, which is a new framework for building neural networks on graph-structured data. Here are some key ways I see this paper relating to other research on graph neural networks:

- It generalizes the idea of equivariant graph networks, which require processing isomorphic graphs in the same way, to allow more flexibility by using "naturality" from category theory. This opens up a bigger class of graph networks.

- It proposes global and local natural graph networks. The local ones seem more practical as they have lower computational complexity like conventional message passing networks, while still being more expressive.

- The idea of using category theory and "natural" transformations to develop graph networks seems novel. Other work like equivariant or convolutional graph networks is based more on symmetries and invariance. The naturality condition in this paper is a less restrictive way to get a well-defined graph network.

- For practical networks, it suggests parameterizing the kernel using a message passing neural network, which allows weight sharing and makes the model more feasible for irregular graphs. This is similar to other work using message passing networks.

- When applied to regular graphs, the natural networks reduce to conventional CNNs or gauge CNNs on manifolds. So it generalizes these as well.

- It shows competitive performance on several graph classification benchmarks, suggesting the natural networks work well in practice while being more flexible.

Overall, the paper seems to propose a new perspective on building graph networks using category theory and naturality. The resulting models are scalable like message passing networks but more expressive. The ideas seem generally applicable, though more extensive evaluation on real-world problems would be helpful. The connections to CNNs are also interesting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more efficient algorithms and implementations for natural graph networks. The authors note that their method currently has around 2x higher computational cost compared to standard message passing networks. Reducing this cost through more optimized implementations could help improve scalability.

- Exploring different choices for the node/edge neighborhoods and representations in natural graph networks. The authors suggest the neighborhoods and representations used are important design choices that impact expressivity vs efficiency trade-offs. More work could be done to understand good heuristics for choosing these.

- Applying the natural network framework to other domains beyond graphs, such as sets or sequences. The authors suggest the mathematical framework of naturality may have broader applicability for building equivariant networks in other domains.

- Combining ideas from natural networks with other advanced graph network architectures like Graph Attention Networks or GraphSAGE. The natural network approach provides a different notion of equivariance than these methods, and combining strengths could lead to improved models.

- Developing theoretical understandings of the representational power and limitations of natural graph networks compared to other graph network architectures. The authors provide some initial expressivity experiments but more theoretical analysis could be done.

- Exploring different choices for parameterizing the message passing kernels, beyond using a message network. The message network gives one way to parameterize the kernels while satisfying naturality, but there may be other more efficient or expressive approaches.

In summary, the main directions are improving efficiency/scalability, better understanding design choices like neighborhoods and representations, applying the natural network framework more broadly, combining with other graph network methods, and developing more theoretical understandings of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new framework called natural graph networks (NGNs) for building neural networks on graph-structured data. NGNs are designed to process graphs irrespective of how they are encoded, an important property since graph encodings are highly non-unique. The key idea is that NGNs should satisfy a "naturality" constraint, meaning they give the same output for isomorphic graphs. This is more general than requiring equivariance to node permutations like in many existing graph networks. 

The authors define global NGNs which apply the naturality constraint across the whole graph, and local NGNs which only apply it locally through message passing. Local NGNs are more scalable but still capture global properties through the relationship between local and global isomorphisms. The authors give a specific instantiation using an equivariant message network that performs well on several graph classification benchmarks. Overall, the NGN framework allows maximally flexible graph networks while still ensuring they are well-defined on graph-structured data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new framework called natural graph networks for building graph neural networks. The key idea is to use the concept of naturality from category theory to ensure the network processes graphs in a way that does not depend on how the graph is represented. 

The authors define global and local natural graph networks. Global natural graph networks process the entire graph in an equivariant way to graph isomorphisms. Local natural graph networks are more scalable and consist of message passing between nodes where the message functions satisfy a local naturality constraint - they commute with isomorphisms of the local node neighbourhoods.

The authors also propose a practical instantiation of a local natural graph network called GCN2 which uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to parameterize the message functions. This allows sharing weights between locally isomorphic neighbourhoods while preserving expressiveness. The GCN2 model achieves competitive performance on several graph classification benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the naturality concept from category theory to graph neural networks to ensure representations do not depend on graph encodings. This enables more flexible graph networks that can leverage local symmetries.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new framework called natural graph networks for designing neural networks on graph-structured data. The key idea is to make the neural network processing invariant to how the graph is encoded, by satisfying a "naturality" constraint that requires isomorphic graphs to be processed equivalently. 

The authors define global and local natural graph networks. Global natural graph networks require the entire graph to be processed naturally, which can be computationally expensive. Local natural graph networks are more scalable as they only require local message passing to be natural. The local message functions can be parameterized with an equivariant graph network, allowing expressivity while maintaining naturality.

Experiments on graph classification benchmarks show the proposed local natural graph network with a simple message network parameterization achieves competitive performance compared to prior global and local graph neural networks. Additional experiments demonstrate the natural processing equivariance on icosahedral MNIST and that the method scales linearly in the number of edges, unlike global graph networks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to design graph neural networks that are invariant to node permutations/relabelings while still being computationally efficient. 

Specifically, the paper notes that prior work has focused on two main approaches:

1) Local invariant graph networks (e.g. graph convolutional networks), which are efficient but have limited expressivity due to being invariant to node permutations. 

2) Global equivariant graph networks, which are expressive but require processing the entire graph as a whole so are not scalable.

The key question the paper seems to be exploring is: how can we design graph networks that are maximally expressive while still being scalable and efficient?

To address this, the authors propose a new class of models called "natural graph networks" which process graphs in a way that does not depend on how the graph is encoded/described (i.e. is invariant to node relabellings). The key ideas are:

- Using the concept of "naturality" from category theory to formally characterize graph network layers that are invariant to node relabellings

- Defining local natural graph networks that are computationally efficient but still more expressive than previous approaches by using message passing with constraints on the kernels based on local graph symmetries/isomorphisms.

So in summary, the main problem is designing scalable and expressive graph networks, and the authors propose using ideas from category theory (naturality) to derive a new class of local graph network models that aim to achieve this goal.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reading the paper text, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Natural graph networks - The overall framework proposed in the paper for designing graph neural networks. The goal is to make graph networks independent of how the graph is represented.

- Global natural graph networks - Natural graph networks that are equivariant to global node permutations. Operate on the entire graph.

- Local natural graph networks - More computationally efficient natural graph networks that are equivariant to local graph isomorphisms. 

- Message passing - The local computation scheme used in local natural graph networks. Messages are passed along edges and aggregated.

- Naturality - A concept from category theory that captures the invariance of networks to different graph representations. Replaces equivariance in more general settings.

- Local invariance - Traditional message passing graph networks have kernels that are invariant to neighborhood permutations, limiting expressivity.

- Kernel constraints - The message passing kernels in natural graph networks must satisfy constraints based on symmetries and isomorphisms of the local neighborhood structure.

- GCN2 - One proposed instantiation of a natural graph network using a Graph Convolutional Network to parameterize the message passing kernel.

So in summary, the key ideas are using naturality rather than just equivariance to generalize graph networks, proposing both global and local versions, and developing flexible message passing schemes through kernel constraints and parameterizations.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 The paper presents a new framework for building neural networks on graph data called natural graph networks (NGN). The key idea is that graph neural networks should process graphs in a way that is independent of how the graph structure is encoded, which is captured by the mathematical notion of naturality from category theory. 

The paper argues that conventional message passing networks like graph convolutional networks are limited in expressivity as they are invariant to permutations of the node neighbors. Global equivariant graph networks can be more expressive but require computation over the entire graph structure. NGNs aim to get the benefits of both approaches.

NGNs consist of passing messages between nodes using kernels that depend on the local graph structure. Critically, the node features transform covariantly under isomorphisms of the node's neighborhood and different kernels can be used for non-isomorphic neighborhood structures. This allows the network to be sensitive to symmetries and asymmetries in the local graph structure. The kernel constraints arise naturally from category theory.

The paper shows NGNs generalize both message passing networks and global equivariant networks. When applied to graphs with global symmetries like lattices, NGNs reduce to conventional equivariant CNNs. The authors propose a practical NGN using a graph neural network to parameterize the kernel, which allows constructing flexible kernels while satisfying the naturality constraints. Experiments on graph classification benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance. Overall, the paper introduces a principled and flexible framework for building graph networks using ideas from category theory.
