## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes categorizing contrastive learning methods based on how they collect negative samples against a positive data point during training. It identifies four main architectures: end-to-end, memory bank, momentum encoder, and clustering. The key takeaway is that the technique for gathering negative samples impacts model performance and efficiency.
