# [Hermite coordinate interpolation kernels: application to image zooming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13195)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image interpolation tasks like geometric transformations require estimating pixel values at non-integer locations based on neighboring pixels. This is typically done using spline interpolation methods.
- Hermite interpolation utilizes both function values and derivative values and can be promising for image tasks, but prior works were limited to 1D/2D and slow implementations. 

Proposed Solution:
- Utilize recent n-dimensional Hermite spline formulation which is easily generalizable to higher dimensions. 
- Construct Hermite convolution kernels for efficient implementation as image convolutions. Kernels depend only on grid points and derivative order, not image content.
- Apply to image zooming task (2x upsampling) using 3 kernels for east, south and southeast samples. Compare to baselines like nearest, bilinear, bicubic and state of the art methods.  

Contributions:
- First framework to construct Hermite spline kernels for n-dimensional image data by inverting certain matrix forms.
- Efficient implementation for image zoom using precomputed kernels instead of direct spline calculation.
- Evaluation on 20 test images shows proposed approach outperforms most methods, especially for multiple zoom iterations, in both PSNR and SSIM metrics.
- Analysis reveals strengths and weaknesses of different interpolation techniques. Hermite balances quality and efficiency.

In summary, the paper develops a theoretical framework to construct Hermite spline kernels for n-dimensional images, enabling efficient interpolation implementation. When applied to an image zooming task, the proposed technique demonstrates superior interpolation accuracy over state of the art methods on benchmark image datasets.
