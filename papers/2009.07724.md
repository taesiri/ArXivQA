# [SelfAugment: Automatic Augmentation Policies for Self-Supervised   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07724)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we evaluate self-supervised representation learning models and select effective data augmentation policies when labeled data is not available?The key hypotheses are:1) A self-supervised image rotation prediction task can serve as an effective proxy for evaluating representations learned via self-supervised contrastive learning, without requiring labels.2) Optimization algorithms can leverage this self-supervised evaluation to automatically select good augmentation policies for contrastive representation learning.In summary, the paper investigates using rotation prediction as an unsupervised way to evaluate and guide data augmentation selection for self-supervised learning. This removes the need for labeled data during unsupervised training.
