# [Multi-Fidelity Methods for Optimization: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Real-world black-box optimization problems often involve expensive simulations or experiments. Running only high-fidelity (HF) evaluations may be prohibitively costly. On the other hand, relying solely on low-fidelity (LF) approximations can compromise accuracy. Multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) strikes a balance between HF accuracy and computational efficiency by leveraging evaluations across multiple fidelities. However, effectively navigating this complex fidelity spectrum poses significant challenges.

Solution:
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of MFO methodologies and applications. The key components of MFO algorithms involve:

1) Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling techniques to approximate the objective function using data from various fidelities. Main methods include correction-based models, auto-regressive models, multi-task Gaussian processes, nonlinear hierarchical models and physics-informed neural networks.

2) Optimizers like Bayesian optimization, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms and bandit-based methods that use the surrogate models to guide the search. 

3) Fidelity management strategies to determine which fidelity level to query at each iteration. Main approaches are fixed sequences or adaptive methods based on uncertainty estimates.

The paper discusses the working principles, benefits and limitations of techniques in each of the above categories. It also provides an extensive overview of MFO applications in domains like engineering design, scientific discovery and machine learning, focusing on problem objectives, fidelity settings and modeling choices.

Main Contributions:

- Comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of algorithms, applications and benchmarks in MFO 

- Identification of key challenges regarding scalability, lower fidelity models, human-in-the-loop integration and benchmarks

- Novel text mining framework to extract insights from over 1200 MFO papers, guiding the structure and content of the survey

- Discussion of future directions like developing near real-world benchmark problems and promoting open science through release of code and standardized benchmarks

Overall, the paper significantly advances understanding of this multifaceted field and lays a strong foundation to catalyze impactful research in MFO.
