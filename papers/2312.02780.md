# [Scaling Laws for Adversarial Attacks on Language Model Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02780)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores adversarial attacks that target the activations within language models by modifying a small subset of model activations to precisely control a significant number of subsequent token predictions. Through empirical analysis on models ranging from 33M to 2.8B parameters, the authors demonstrate an approximate linear scaling law relating the number of controlled activation tokens $a$ to the maximum number of target tokens $t_{\text{max}}$ that can be dictated as $t_{\text{max}}=\kappa a$, where $\kappa$ is a model-specific attack multiplier constant. Remarkably, the ratio of input control bits to output influence bits, defined as attack resistance $\chi$, remains fairly consistent between 16-25 across models. Compared to token substitution attacks, activation attacks enable exponentially stronger control, however the attack strength normalized by dimensionality is comparable. This dimensional analysis provides evidence that adversarial vulnerability arises fundamentally from the mismatch between input and output space dimensions. Practical implications are highlighted for retrieval models directly encoding retrieved text as activations and multi-modal models concatenating modalities onto activations. Overall, the identified activation attack vulnerability underscores a critical security weakness in language models that warrants further research into defensive strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper empirically studies adversarial attacks on language model activations, demonstrating the ability to precisely control up to around 100 subsequent predicted tokens by manipulating a small subset of activations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Identifying scaling laws for adversarial attacks on language model activations, showing that the maximum number of target tokens an attacker can control ($t_\mathrm{max}$) scales linearly with the number of attack tokens ($a$) as $t_\mathrm{max} = \kappa a$, where $\kappa$ is a model-specific constant called the attack multiplier.

2. Connecting the attack multiplier $\kappa$ to the activation dimension $d$, showing empirically that $\kappa$ scales linearly with $d$. This supports the hypothesis that adversarial vulnerability arises from a mismatch between input and output dimensions.

3. Comparing activation attacks to token substitution attacks. Showing that while activation attacks are much stronger, the attack strength in terms of bits controlled per bits influencing the output is similar between the two attack types when accounting for the different dimensionalities. This further supports the dimension mismatch hypothesis.

4. Exploring the effect of separating the attack tokens from the target tokens, finding the attack strength is unaffected up to 100 tokens of separation, then drops logarithmically. But even with 1000 token separation, the first token's activation still controls ~8 output tokens.

So in summary, the main contribution is identifying empirical scaling laws for activation attacks on language models, connecting these to a simple theory based on input/output dimension mismatch, and comparing to token substitution attacks. The key finding is that language model activations are highly vulnerable to precise control by an attacker.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Adversarial attacks on language models
- Attacks on activations/residual streams rather than tokens
- Scaling laws relating attack length, target length, activation dimensions
- Attack multiplier $\kappa$ - number of target tokens an attack token can control 
- Attack resistance $\chi$ - bits of input control needed for 1 bit of output control
- Dimensional mismatch between input and output spaces
- Comparison to token substitution attacks
- Effect of separating attack and target within context
- Implications for multi-modal models and retrieval

The paper presents empirical studies and a geometric theory related to adversarial vulnerabilities in language models, specifically by attacking the activations/residual streams rather than the tokens. It identifies scaling laws characterizing the attack strength and resistance, compares to traditional token attacks, and discusses the potential implications especially for multi-modal models where activations can be more directly accessed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a scaling law relating the maximum number of target tokens $t_{max}$ that can be controlled by an attack to the number of attack tokens $a$, as $t_{max} = \kappa a$. How is this scaling law derived theoretically? What assumptions does it rely on?

2. The attack multiplier $\kappa$ seems to have an empirical linear relationship with the dimension $d$ of the activation vectors. However, the paper states that theoretically $\kappa$ should depend on $d$, the precision $p$, and the vocabulary size $V$. What is the exact theoretical formula predicted for $\kappa$ and how is it derived? 

3. The attack resistance $\chi$ quantifies how many bits on the input need to be controlled to manipulate one bit on the output. The values reported for $\chi$ are consistently higher than 1. What factors contribute to $\chi>1$? Can you propose modifications to the model or training procedure that could reduce $\chi$?

4. When using a fraction $f$ of activation dimensions in the attack, why does the theory predict that the effective attack length changes from $a$ to $fa$? Intuitively, why should reducing dimensions have the same effect as reducing the number of attack tokens?  

5. The token substitution attacks seem much weaker than activation attacks, yet their attack resistance $\chi$ is surprisingly close. Why does the theory predict the attack multipliers $\kappa$ and $\kappa_{token}$ should be related by the expression in Equation 16? Where could this prediction break down?

6. Even with 1000 tokens separating the attack from the target tokens, the first token's activation still controls around 8 output tokens. What architectural factors might explain why attacks retain potency over such long distances?

7. How exactly is the gradient $\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial P$ computed during optimization of the attack perturbation $P$? Walk through the details of backpropagation needed to calculate this gradient.

8. The attack procedure samples random target tokens $T$ and contexts $S$. How would your experimental conclusions change if natural language contexts and targets were used instead? What are the tradeoffs?

9. For the token substitution attacks, could more sophisticated optimization procedures like gradient descent find better solutions than the greedy search employed? What difficulties might gradient-based approaches face?

10. How exactly does attacking later layers of the model instead of the embedding layer activations compare in terms of attack success rate? What changes both conceptually and implementation-wise when attacking intermediate activations?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper explores adversarial attacks targeting the activations (residual streams) of language models. By manipulating a small subset of activations, the goal is to control the exact predictions of a significant number (up to 1000) of subsequent tokens. 

- This poses a practical threat as activations can be directly manipulated in retrieval-based models or multimodal models, allowing fine-grained control over model outputs.

Methodology
- The authors attack the activations of the first few tokens in a sequence context, optimizing a perturbation to force the model to predict an arbitrary target sequence of tokens.

- They systematically vary the number of attacked tokens, target length, model size etc. to empirically measure the attack success and derive scaling laws relating input control to output influence.  

Key Findings
- A linear scaling law is found where the max number of controlled output tokens scales linearly with the number of attacked input tokens, following t_max = κ*a. The attack multiplier κ is model-specific.

- κ was found to scale linearly with activation dimension, with each input dimension controlling 16-25 output bits across models, suggesting dimensionality mismatch underlies vulnerability.

- Attacking 1 token activation gave precise control over ~100 output tokens. This was orders of magnitude more powerful than substituting 1 input token directly.

- However, input control bits to output influence bits ratio was similar for both attacks - further evidence for the dimensionality mismatch theory.

- Even with 1000 tokens separating the attack from targets, the first token activations retained control over subsequent generations.

In summary, the paper uncovers a major vulnerability in LLMs to attacks on activations, verifies empirical scaling laws suggesting a dimensionality mismatch cause, and highlights risks for retrieval/multimodal models that give activation access.
