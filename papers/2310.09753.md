# [When can transformers reason with abstract symbols?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09753)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper investigates the capabilities of transformer large language models (LLMs) on relational reasoning tasks involving abstract symbols. The central research question is when and how LLMs can learn to generalize on these tasks, which require reasoning about how symbols relate to each other rather than just memorizing training examples. 

Specifically, the authors analyze two types of "template tasks":

1) Tasks with real-valued labels, like simple programming examples. The main result is that transformers can learn to generalize on these tasks, but may require very large amounts of training data depending on the complexity. 

2) Tasks with symbolic labels, like copying an input symbol. Surprisingly, the authors show an "inverse scaling law" where transformer performance gets worse as model size increases. 

For both settings, the authors propose small modifications to the standard transformer architecture to improve data efficiency and generalization.

Overall, this work provides theoretical analysis and experimental results to illuminate when and how modern LLMs can perform relational reasoning on abstract symbols, which is an important building block for more complex reasoning abilities. The central focus is on formally characterizing the generalization behavior and sample complexity of transformers on these tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes and analyzes a framework of "template tasks" for studying relational reasoning abilities in neural networks. The key contributions are:

1. Introducing template tasks as a way to formally measure relational reasoning. These tasks involve learning from strings generated by substituting wildcards in templates, and generalizing to unseen symbols.

2. Proving analytically that standard MLP architectures fail to generalize on template tasks, regardless of the amount of training data. This supports longstanding criticisms that MLPs cannot learn to reason relationally. 

3. Proving that transformers can learn template tasks given enough data, establishing their capability for relational reasoning. However, transformers are data inefficient. 

4. Proposing a small modification to the transformer architecture, adding trainable scalings to the self-attention matrix, that improves data efficiency on template tasks.

5. Extending the framework to symbolic label tasks, where transformers exhibit an "inverse scaling law" and fail to generalize as their size grows. A different simple modification is proposed to fix this.

6. Providing experimental validation, including on pretrained models, supporting the theory.

In summary, this paper makes fundamental contributions towards understanding and improving neural networks' inductive biases for relational reasoning over abstract symbols. The proposed template tasks and theoretical analysis offer insights into when and why different architectures succeed or fail at these foundational reasoning skills.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related work:

- The paper proposes a novel approach for relational reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by using abstract symbol manipulation tasks. This is related to prior work studying relational reasoning in neural networks, but focuses specifically on modern LLMs rather than more classical architectures.

- It provides both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrating when and why LLMs succeed or fail at these reasoning tasks. Much prior work has studied relational reasoning empirically, but this paper provides a more rigorous characterization.

- For tasks with real-valued labels, the paper proves LLMs can learn to generalize given enough training data, in contrast to MLPs which provably fail. This theoretical guarantee on transformer architectures is novel.

- For symbolic-label tasks, the paper shows an "inverse scaling law" where LLMs fail as model size increases. This phenomenon has been observed recently in other contexts, but hasn't been shown formally for reasoning tasks before.

- The paper proposes subtle architecture modifications that improve data efficiency and enable success on tasks where vanilla transformers fail. This provides new insights into inductive biases for relational reasoning compared to prior work modifying training procedures or proposing new models.

In summary, while related to existing empirical evaluations of relational reasoning, this paper provides formal theoretical results characterizing when and why LLMs succeed or fail on these tasks. The analysis leads to architectural insights that are novel compared to prior work. The formal task framework for relational reasoning is also rigorous and general compared to many existing benchmarks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions:

1. Explore architectural modifications to improve inductive bias for relational reasoning in LLMs. For example, modifications based on analyses of more complex reasoning tasks like syllogisms, symmetry reasoning, and compositional reasoning. Also data augmentation approaches like concatenating $\mathbf{XX}^T$ to the input.

2. Study other types of reasoning beyond just relational reasoning on abstract symbols, like arithmetic reasoning, contextual reasoning, indexing, etc. Their framework of template tasks could potentially be extended to these settings. 

3. Modify training to improve relational reasoning abilities. For example, apply techniques like Temporal Context Normalization during training as proposed by Webb et al. (2020). Also design new architectures specialized for relational reasoning.

4. Analyze other neural network architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and graph neural networks. Do they exhibit similar phenomena and how can they be improved?

5. Extend the theoretical analysis to deeper transformer networks. The results in this paper are for single-layer transformers.

6. Provide sample complexity lower bounds on how much training data is needed for good generalization. Their achievability results require large datasets.

7. Understand what properties of pretraining help improve reasoning abilities when fine-tuning on downstream tasks. For example, the pronounced diagonals in attention heads of pretrained models seem related to their proposed architecture modifications.

In summary, the main suggestions are to design better architectures, training procedures, and theories tailored to different forms of reasoning, beyond just the template tasks with abstract symbols studied in this paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies the capabilities of transformer language models on relational reasoning tasks involving abstract symbols. The authors formalize a framework of "template tasks" to isolate and analyze reasoning abilities, consisting of regression problems with real-valued labels and next-token prediction problems with symbolic labels. For regression tasks, they prove transformers can learn to generalize given enough training data, but may require impractically large datasets even for simple tasks. For symbolic-label tasks, transformers fail to generalize as their embedding dimension grows, exhibiting an "inverse scaling law". To improve data efficiency, the authors propose adding extra trainable parameters to the attention heads to emphasize the input's incidence matrix. They support their analysis with experiments, and find their proposed modifications yield empirical gains. Overall, the work provides theoretical and empirical insights into strengths and limitations of transformers for relational reasoning with abstract symbols.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the capabilities of transformer large language models (LLMs) on relational reasoning tasks involving abstract symbols. Relational reasoning tasks, which involve deriving meaning from how symbols interact rather than the identities of the symbols themselves, have long been studied in neuroscience as fundamental building blocks for more complex cognitive abilities. The authors formalize a framework of reasoning tasks called template tasks that come in two varieties: regression problems with real number labels, and next-token prediction problems with symbolic labels. 

For regression template tasks, the authors prove transformers can learn to generalize to unseen symbols when trained, but may require large amounts of training data. For symbolic-label template tasks, transformers surprisingly fail to generalize as their embedding dimension grows larger. To address these limitations, the authors propose subtle modifications to the transformer architecture, like adding trainable parameters to the attention matrices, that improve data efficiency in both settings. They support their theoretical results with experiments, and also find pretraining helps transformers better solve template tasks. Overall, this work provides formal insights into when transformers can or cannot perform relational reasoning with abstract symbols, and how their inductive biases for reasoning can be improved.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel model leveraging transformers to perform relational reasoning tasks involving abstract symbols. The main idea is to analyze how large language models (LLMs) such as transformers can learn to generalize in relational reasoning tasks when trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset. 

Specifically, the authors formally define a framework of "template tasks", which are reasoning tasks where the training and test data are generated by substituting placeholders in symbolic templates with concrete tokens. For example, a template could be "If X gives Y Z apples, how many apples does Y have?", which generates a dataset by substituting X, Y, Z with names, numbers, etc. Crucially, the test set uses fresh substitutions unseen during training.

The authors first prove that multilayer perceptrons fail to generalize on unseen symbols in these tasks regardless of dataset size, due to inherent permutation invariance. In contrast, they show transformers can learn these tasks given enough training data diversity, by analyzing the training dynamics. Furthermore, they identify subtle modifications to the transformer architecture, adding trainable parameters to the attention mechanism, that significantly improve its data efficiency on these tasks.

In summary, the core method is a theoretical analysis elucidating when and how transformers can learn to perform relational reasoning on diverse template task datasets, as well as architectural improvements to enhance their data efficiency. The analysis yields fundamental insights into how transformer inductive biases enable emergent reasoning abilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper investigates the capabilities of transformer large language models (LLMs) on relational reasoning tasks involving abstract symbols. Relational reasoning, where meaning is derived from how symbols interact rather than their identities, is hypothesized to be a core component of abilities like programming, mathematics, and verbal reasoning. The authors formalize a class of reasoning tasks called "template tasks" to probe whether LLMs can learn to reason relationally about novel abstract symbols when trained.

The key questions addressed are:

1) Can LLMs learn to generalize on template tasks with real-valued labels, where the goal is to infer abstract rules from training examples? 

2) Can LLMs learn template tasks where the labels are themselves abstract symbols, which requires not just inferring rules but also predicting novel symbols?

3) Can the inductive biases of LLMs like transformers be improved to make them more data-efficient at these tasks?

4) How does pretraining affect the reasoning abilities of LLMs?

Overall, this work aims to rigorously analyze whether and how LLMs can perform relational reasoning with abstract symbols, which has long been studied in neuroscience and psychology as a core component of intelligent behavior. The template task framework allows formally probing this capability.
