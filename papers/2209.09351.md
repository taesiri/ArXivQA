# [Space-time tradeoffs of lenses and optics via higher category theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09351)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the central question is:

How can we capture the operational differences between denotationally equivalent categories of cartesian optics and lenses using higher category theory?

In particular, the paper is interested in making explicit the different composition rules and space-time tradeoffs of lenses versus optics, which are not visible when treating them as ordinary categories. To address this, the paper introduces a 2-categorical framework to track additional structure like the internal states of optics.

Some of the key goals mentioned are:

- Define the 2-category of optics whose 2-cells explicitly track internal configuration of optics.

- Show the 1-category of optics arises by locally quotienting out connected components of the 2-category. 

- Study how the embedding of lenses into cartesian optics gets upgraded to an oplax functor in the 2-setting, detecting the different composition rule.

- Establish that the known isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics arises from an underlying lax 2-adjunction between their double categorical counterparts.

So in summary, the central research question seems to be how introducing 2-categorical structure can capture operational differences between lenses and optics that are invisible categorically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be:

1. Identifying operational differences between lenses and optics, which are denotationally isomorphic under certain conditions. Specifically, the paper shows that lenses and optics implement different space-time tradeoffs when composed - lenses use minimal memory but recompute intermediate results, while optics save all intermediate results but use more memory.

2. Formally capturing these operational differences by lifting the existing categorical constructions to the 2-categorical level. The paper defines the 2-category of optics whose 2-cells track the internal configuration of optics. It shows the 1-category of optics arises via a quotient. 

3. Studying the relationship between lenses and optics in this 2-categorical setting. The equivalence between cartesian lenses and optics is upgraded to an adjunction between their 2-categorical counterparts. The embedding of lenses into optics becomes an oplax functor that detects the different composition rules.

4. Relating the well-known isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics to a conjectured lax 2-adjunction between their double categorical counterparts. This suggests the isomorphism is a result of erasing operational data.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be using 2-category theory to make explicit the operational differences between lenses and optics that are invisible in the standard 1-categorical treatment, providing new perspective on their relationship. The paper does this in an accessible way, introducing the relevant concepts along the way.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper lifts the existing categorical constructions of lenses and optics to the 2-categorical level to explicitly track their internal state and operational aspects, distinguishing between denotationally equivalent but operationally different optics and establishing a 2-adjunction between cartesian lenses and 2-optics that models their different composition rules.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on lenses and optics:

- It focuses specifically on the operational differences between lenses and optics from a software engineering perspective. Much research on lenses/optics is more abstract and mathematical in nature. This paper aims to bridge theory and practice.

- It highlights the different space/time tradeoffs of composing lenses versus optics, relating lens composition to gradient checkpointing. This operational distinction seems underappreciated in other lens/optic research.

- It introduces the idea of 2-optics to make explicit the internal configurations of optics that are quotiented out in normal 1-categorical optics. This allows tracking operational data in a higher dimensional setting. Other category theoretic accounts have not proposed something similar as far as I know.

- It connects the equivalence between cartesian lenses and optics to an adjunction between their 2-categorical counterparts. This builds on established results to reveal new structure. I'm not aware of other work elucidating this connection.

- Overall, the focus on teasing out the operational subtleties in going between the 1-categorical and 2-categorical picture seems novel. Most other research treats lenses/optics in a 1-categorical way without examining higher dimensions.

So in summary, this paper provides a unique perspective by really delving into the operational aspects of lenses/optics using higher category theory. It relates the math to practical implementation concerns in a way I haven't seen as explicitly in other works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more refined 2-categorical constructions to better capture operational aspects of optics and lenses. The paper suggests lifting existing 1-categorical definitions to the 2-categorical setting in order to explicitly track additional structure like internal configurations and reparameterization morphisms. This could lead to new 2-categories of optics that distinguish between operationally different but denotationally equivalent constructions.

- Providing a full proof of the conjecture that the isomorphism between cartesian optics and lenses arises from a lax 2-adjunction between their double categorical counterparts. The authors suggest this is a promising avenue to relate the operational differences between lenses and optics.

- Exploring closed lenses through the lens of 2-category theory. The paper indicates closed lenses likely exhibit lax structure when embedded into 2-optics, but the details are not provided. Expanding on this could uncover new insights.

- Developing more applications of the 2-categorical perspective in areas like automatic differentiation, bidirectional transformations, dynamical systems, etc. The operational view provided by higher categories could have useful implications in these applied settings that rely on compositionality.

- Generalizing the story beyond cartesian optics/lenses to larger families of optical constructions. The authors mention broader "zoos" of bidirectional gadgets that could also benefit from explicit 2-categorical treatment.

In summary, the 2-categorical viewpoint seems very promising for teasing apart operational nuances glossed over in conventional 1-categorical optics, which could lead to more refined compositional bidirectional theories. Lifting constructions to higher categories and relating distinct models via adjunctions/equivalences is highlighted as a particularly fertile ground for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies the categorical relationship between lenses and optics, which are abstract data structures used to model bidirectional data flow. It focuses on the operational differences between lenses and optics, arguing that even though they are equivalent from a denotational perspective, lenses use less memory but more time due to recomputation while optics use more memory but less time by caching intermediate results. To make these operational distinctions explicit, the paper defines a 2-category of optics which tracks the internal state transformations. It shows the equivalence between cartesian lenses and optics arises from an adjunction between their 2-categorical counterparts. Overall, the paper provides a higher categorical perspective to distinguish between extensionally equivalent but operationally different optics.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the 2-category of 2-optics as a way to distinguish between optics that are denotationally equivalent but have different operational behavior. It starts by studying cartesian lenses and their composition, showing that it implements gradient checkpointing - a tradeoff using minimal memory but more computation time. It then introduces cartesian optics which have more flexible composition, allowing tradeoffs between memory and time. The key observation is that the equivalence between cartesian optics and lenses is denotational, ignoring operational differences in their composition. 

To make these differences explicit, the paper defines the 2-category of 2-optics, whose morphisms track the internal state of optics. This allows distinguishing optics with different internals. The equivalence between cartesian optics and lenses is upgraded to an adjunction between their 2-categorical counterparts. The embedding of lenses into optics becomes an oplax functor detecting the different composition. While an adjunction doesn't exist in standard 2-categories, the paper conjectures the equivalence arises from a lax 2-adjunction between double categories. Overall, the 2-categorical perspective illuminates the tradeoffs and operational behavior of optics and lenses.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces 2-optics, a 2-categorical version of optics, as a way to explicitly track the internal state and operational aspects of optics that are ignored in the standard 1-categorical definition. It does this by defining the hom-category of optics as an oplax colimit rather than a coend, resulting in a hom-category rather than a hom-set. This allows residual morphisms between optics to be reified as 2-cells instead of being quotiented out. The paper shows how cartesian lenses embed into 2-optics via an oplax functor, with the oplaxator detecting the different composition rules of lenses and optics. It establishes that the known isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics likely arises from an adjunction between their 2-categorical counterparts. Overall, the 2-categorical approach makes it possible to formally distinguish optics that are denotationally equivalent but have different operational behavior.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, this paper appears to be addressing a few key issues:

1. The denotational/extensional nature of the existing categorical definitions of optics and lenses. The paper argues these definitions treat optics and lenses from an "outside observer" perspective, ignoring operational and implementation details. 

2. The space-time tradeoffs involved in composing lenses versus optics. Lens composition uses less memory but more recomputation time, while optic composition uses more memory but less recomputation time.

3. Providing a higher categorical framework to make explicit the operational differences between optics and lenses that are invisible in the standard categorical definitions. This is done by defining a 2-category of optics where 2-cells track internal configuration details.

4. Upgrading the known equivalence between cartesian optics and lenses to an adjunction between their 2-categorical counterparts. This makes the different composition rules explicit via the oplax functor embedding lenses into optics.

5. Explaining why this adjunction doesn't reside in any of the standard 2-categories and establishing a conjecture that the optics/lenses equivalence arises from a lax 2-adjunction in the 3-category of double categories.

In summary, the key goals seem to be adding operational/implementation details to the standard categorical story of optics/lenses and explaining the higher categorical relationships between them. The paper aims to provide both new research results and serve as an accessible introduction to the topic.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes representing optics using an oplax colimit rather than a regular colimit.

3. You show that the 1-category of optics arises by taking connected components of the 2-category of optics. Can you explain in more detail the relationship between connected components and operational equivalence of optics? Why does quotienting by connected components erase operational distinctions?

4. The oplax functor embedding lenses into 2-optics has an oplaxator that detects the different composition rules. How exactly does the oplaxator capture the discrepancy between composing lenses versus composing the corresponding optics?

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper studies the equivalence between cartesian lenses and cartesian optics from an operational perspective. It observes that while these categories are denotationally isomorphic, they implement different space-time tradeoffs when composed - lenses recompute intermediate results while optics cache them, with implications for memory usage and runtime. The paper lifts the existing 1-categorical framework to 2-categories to make these operational differences explicit. It defines the 2-category of optics $\TwoOptic(\cC)$ and shows the equivalence arises from a lax 2-adjunction between the double categorical counterparts of lenses and 2-optics.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points made in the paper:

This paper studies the equivalence between cartesian lenses and cartesian optics from an operational perspective. It observes that while these categories are isomorphic when viewed externally, they implement different internal composition rules which lead to different space-time tradeoffs - lenses recompute intermediate results while optics cache them, with lenses using less memory but more time. To make these operational aspects visible, the paper lifts the constructions to 2-categories by defining 2-optics using oplax colimits. It shows the equivalence becomes an oplax functor detecting the different composition.

Overall, the paper provides a 2-categorical framework to distinguish operationally different but denotationally equivalent optics, elucidating their space-time tradeoffs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper defines the 2-category of 2-optics and shows that it reduces to the 1-category of optics by locally quotienting things out. What are the advantages of modeling optics as a 2-category rather than a 1-category? How does it allow distinguishing between denotationally equivalent but operationally different kinds of optics?

2. The paper proves there is an oplax functor embedding cartesian lenses into 2-optics, with an oplaxator that detects the different composition rule between lenses and optics. What aspects of the internal configuration and operational behavior of lenses and optics motivate defining this as an oplax rather than lax or pseudo functor?

3. The paper establishes a conjecture that the isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics arises from the lax 2-adjunction between their double categorical counterparts. What are the challenges in proving this conjecture and why does it require situating the construction in the double category of double categories, lax functors, lax transformations and modifications?

4. How does the paper's explicit construction of morphisms in the 2-category of optics as a coend clarify the operational meaning of residuals as internal states? Why is this relevant for distinguishing efficient vs inefficient implementations?

5. The paper shows lens composition implements gradient checkpointing, while optic composition implements reuse of intermediate computation. How do these different space-time tradeoffs arise from the nature of their composition? Can you think of examples where one might be preferred over the other?

6. How does the directionality of 2-cells in the 2-category of optics allow interpreting them operationally in terms of optimizing and moving reparameterizations? What role does this play in relating lenses and optics?

7. The paper proves that the 1-category of optics arises from the 2-category by locally quotienting out connected components. What does this imply about the information lost in the 1-categorical perspective? When is it appropriate to erase this operational data?
