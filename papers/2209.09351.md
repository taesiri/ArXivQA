# [Space-time tradeoffs of lenses and optics via higher category theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09351)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the central question is:How can we capture the operational differences between denotationally equivalent categories of cartesian optics and lenses using higher category theory?In particular, the paper is interested in making explicit the different composition rules and space-time tradeoffs of lenses versus optics, which are not visible when treating them as ordinary categories. To address this, the paper introduces a 2-categorical framework to track additional structure like the internal states of optics.Some of the key goals mentioned are:- Define the 2-category of optics whose 2-cells explicitly track internal configuration of optics.- Show the 1-category of optics arises by locally quotienting out connected components of the 2-category. - Study how the embedding of lenses into cartesian optics gets upgraded to an oplax functor in the 2-setting, detecting the different composition rule.- Establish that the known isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics arises from an underlying lax 2-adjunction between their double categorical counterparts.So in summary, the central research question seems to be how introducing 2-categorical structure can capture operational differences between lenses and optics that are invisible categorically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper seems to be:1. Identifying operational differences between lenses and optics, which are denotationally isomorphic under certain conditions. Specifically, the paper shows that lenses and optics implement different space-time tradeoffs when composed - lenses use minimal memory but recompute intermediate results, while optics save all intermediate results but use more memory.2. Formally capturing these operational differences by lifting the existing categorical constructions to the 2-categorical level. The paper defines the 2-category of optics whose 2-cells track the internal configuration of optics. It shows the 1-category of optics arises via a quotient. 3. Studying the relationship between lenses and optics in this 2-categorical setting. The equivalence between cartesian lenses and optics is upgraded to an adjunction between their 2-categorical counterparts. The embedding of lenses into optics becomes an oplax functor that detects the different composition rules.4. Relating the well-known isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics to a conjectured lax 2-adjunction between their double categorical counterparts. This suggests the isomorphism is a result of erasing operational data.In summary, the key contribution seems to be using 2-category theory to make explicit the operational differences between lenses and optics that are invisible in the standard 1-categorical treatment, providing new perspective on their relationship. The paper does this in an accessible way, introducing the relevant concepts along the way.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper lifts the existing categorical constructions of lenses and optics to the 2-categorical level to explicitly track their internal state and operational aspects, distinguishing between denotationally equivalent but operationally different optics and establishing a 2-adjunction between cartesian lenses and 2-optics that models their different composition rules.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on lenses and optics:- It focuses specifically on the operational differences between lenses and optics from a software engineering perspective. Much research on lenses/optics is more abstract and mathematical in nature. This paper aims to bridge theory and practice.- It highlights the different space/time tradeoffs of composing lenses versus optics, relating lens composition to gradient checkpointing. This operational distinction seems underappreciated in other lens/optic research.- It introduces the idea of 2-optics to make explicit the internal configurations of optics that are quotiented out in normal 1-categorical optics. This allows tracking operational data in a higher dimensional setting. Other category theoretic accounts have not proposed something similar as far as I know.- It connects the equivalence between cartesian lenses and optics to an adjunction between their 2-categorical counterparts. This builds on established results to reveal new structure. I'm not aware of other work elucidating this connection.- Overall, the focus on teasing out the operational subtleties in going between the 1-categorical and 2-categorical picture seems novel. Most other research treats lenses/optics in a 1-categorical way without examining higher dimensions.So in summary, this paper provides a unique perspective by really delving into the operational aspects of lenses/optics using higher category theory. It relates the math to practical implementation concerns in a way I haven't seen as explicitly in other works.
