# [Controllable Preference Optimization: Toward Controllable   Multi-Objective Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19085)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values/preferences is challenging due to the multifaceted and sometimes conflicting nature of human preferences (e.g. tradeoffs between helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness). 
- Existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional and fail to handle tradeoffs across different objectives, leading to suboptimal performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO) to explicitly specify preference scores for different objectives to guide LLM responses. 
- CPO has two main stages:
   1) Controllable preference supervised fine-tuning (CPSFT): Provides explicit preference conditions via tokens (e.g. <Helpfulness: 5>) and trains models to generate responses following these.
   2) Controllable direct preference optimization (CDPO): Compares human preference scores of model responses under given conditions to a conditional multi-preference score, increasing probability of better responses.
- Handles both single and multi-objective preference conditions. Without conditions, optimizes all objectives (reduces to direct preference optimization).

Main Contributions:
- Formulates controllable multi-objective alignment problem and proposes CPO solution.
- Achieves good controllability on single objectives while maintaining alignment performance.
- Outperforms baselines on helping mitigate conflicts in multi-objective alignment, achieving Pareto improvements.
- Provides flexibility to tailor LLM responses to desired preferences, mitigating impact of alignment tradeoffs.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel technique to control alignment across multiple potentially conflicting objectives, enabling flexible guidance of LLM behavior using explicit preference conditions.
