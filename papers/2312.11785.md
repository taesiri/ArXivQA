# [Zero-Shot Fact-Checking with Semantic Triples and Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11785)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fact checking models require large amounts of labeled training data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This limits their applicability to new domains.
- Supervised models also tend to exploit biases and artifacts in datasets rather than learn nuanced language understanding. They struggle on adversarial and out-of-domain datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a zero-shot fact checking method using semantic triples and knowledge graphs. 
- It decomposes the claim and evidence into triples using open information extraction.
- A universal schema model augments these triples further using Wikidata and Wikipedia.
- Pretrained natural language inference (NLI) models are used to verify claim triples against evidence triples. No model training takes place.
- Finally, a rule-based system aggregates the triple-level verdicts to determine an overall verdict for the claim.

Key Contributions:
- The method achieves state-of-the-art results among zero-shot approaches on FEVER, FEVER-Symmetric and Climate-FEVER datasets.
- It demonstrates greater robustness than supervised models on adversarial datasets FEVER-Symmetric and FEVER 2.0.
- On the out-of-domain Climate-FEVER dataset, it substantially outperforms previous supervised methods.
- Ablation experiments demonstrate that improvements over NLI baselines are consistent across different variants.
- Qualitative analysis shows the method handles mutual exclusivity well and benefits from higher evidence quality.

In summary, the key highlight is a novel zero-shot fact checking approach using semantic triples and knowledge graphs. Without model training, it rivals or exceeds supervised methods in accuracy and robustness across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel zero-shot fact-checking method that decomposes claims and evidence into semantic triples augmented with knowledge graphs and uses large language models trained for natural language inference, demonstrating enhanced robustness against adversarial datasets and out-of-domain generalization compared to supervised approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel zero-shot method for fact-checking that utilizes semantic triples and knowledge graphs. Specifically:

- The paper proposes decomposing the claim and evidence sentences into semantic triples, augmenting them using external knowledge graphs, and then feeding them to large language models pretrained for natural language inference. This allows the model to generalize better to adversarial and out-of-domain datasets without requiring additional training data.

- The paper introduces a system that extracts triples from claims and evidence, performs triple-level verification using an NLI model in a zero-shot setting, and then aggregates the triple-level predictions to reach a final claim-level verdict.

- The paper leverages a universal schema model trained on Wikidata and Wikipedia to fill potential gaps in the evidence triples.

- The empirical results demonstrate that this approach outperforms previous zero-shot methods and supervised models on adversarial and out-of-domain fact-checking datasets, while remaining competitive on the original FEVER dataset.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel zero-shot fact-checking approach using semantic triples and knowledge graphs that achieves enhanced robustness and generalization ability compared to existing methods.

The paper proposes a zero-shot fact-checking method that uses semantic triples extracted from claims and evidence sentences. It utilizes knowledge graphs and a universal schema model to fill gaps in the extracted triples. Pretrained NLI models are then used for triple-level inference, followed by claim-level aggregation. The goal is to develop a robust fact-checking approach that can generalize to adversarial and out-of-domain datasets without relying on annotated training data. The method is evaluated on datasets like FEVER, FEVER-Symmetric, FEVER 2.0 and Climate-FEVER. Overall, the key focus is on zero-shot learning, semantic triples, knowledge graphs and achieving adversarial robustness for fact-checking.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using semantic triples to represent the claim and evidence sentences. What are the advantages of using this representation over operating directly on the sentences? How does it allow the model to generalize better?

2. The paper extracts triples using an open information extraction (OpenIE) tool. What are some challenges in using an OpenIE tool for this task compared to having a predefined schema? How does the paper try to address some of those challenges?

3. The triple-level verification step uses an NLI model to assign labels to each claim-evidence triple pair. What modifications were made to the standard NLI format to adapt it for this task? How were the NLI labels mapped to the fact checking labels?

4. The paper uses several techniques like max voting, majority voting and weighted sampling to aggregate the triple-level labels to the claim level. Can you explain these techniques? What are the tradeoffs between them? Which one works the best and why?

5. How exactly does the Universal Schema component work? What is the training objective used? How does it help fill gaps between the extracted claim and evidence triples? Provide an example to illustrate this.

6. The paper shows that the performance gains are higher when gold evidence is used compared to retrieved evidence. What does this indicate about the approach? How can it be improved further?

7. What evaluation datasets are used in the paper? Why are the adversarial FEVER-Symmetric and FEVER 2.0 datasets particularly important for evaluating the robustness of the method?

8. How does the proposed zero-shot learning approach compare against supervised methods on the different datasets? What conclusions can you draw about the robustness and generalization capability of the method?

9. The Climate-FEVER dataset consists of real-world climate change claims. Why is performance on this out-of-domain dataset an important indicator of the method's applicability to real-world scenarios?  

10. What are some limitations of the current method? How can it be extended to handle multiple languages and incorporate diverse knowledge sources beyond Wikipedia?
