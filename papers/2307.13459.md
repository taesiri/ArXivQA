# [Weakly-supervised 3D Pose Transfer with Keypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13459)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an effective 3D pose transfer model that is weakly-supervised and does not require ground truth paired data or meshes to be in a T-pose?The key hypotheses seem to be:- Using a keypoint-based framework with topology-agnostic keypoint detection and inverse kinematics can help disentangle pose from shape information and enable cross-topology pose transfer. - A cycle reconstruction constraint can enforce pose transfer in a self-supervised manner without requiring ground truth paired data.- Modeling pseudo skinning weights with a Gaussian mixture model can provide reasonable supervision in the absence of ground truth skinning weights.So in summary, the paper proposes a new weakly-supervised 3D pose transfer approach to address the limitations of existing supervised and unsupervised methods, using a combination of keypoint detection, inverse kinematics, cycle reconstruction, and pseudo skinning weights to achieve effective pose transfer without strict requirements on training data or mesh topology.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a new weakly-supervised framework for 3D pose transfer that only requires keypoint supervision, rather than ground truth paired meshes. This makes the approach more practical since paired data is difficult to obtain.- Using a combination of topology-agnostic keypoint detection and differentiable inverse kinematics to better disentangle the pose information from the shape information of the target mesh. This allows transferring just the pose while preserving the shape details. - Introducing a cycle reconstruction loss to enforce pose transfer in a self-supervised manner without requiring ground truth paired data.- Designing a Gaussian Mixture Model method to generate pseudo labels for supervision of the skinning weights prediction in the absence of ground truth skinning weights. - Showing that the approach works on meshes with different topologies, unlike many previous methods. The keypoint detection and skinning make the method topology-agnostic.- Achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks compared to previous supervised and unsupervised methods, even with only weak keypoint supervision. The method also shows good generalization across datasets.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a weakly-supervised and topology-agnostic 3D pose transfer framework that achieves strong performance compared to prior arts, while requiring less supervision. The combination of keypoint detection, inverse kinematics, and cycle reconstruction seems key to the improved disentanglement and performance.
