# [How Human-Centered Explainable AI Interface Are Designed and Evaluated:   A Systematic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14496)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Despite major advances in explainable AI (XAI) algorithms, current XAI systems still lack usability, practical interpretability and efficacy for real users. There is a gap between technically sound XAI algorithms and producing effective explanations that users can understand and use. 

Proposed Solution: 
The emerging research area of explainable interfaces (EIs) focuses specifically on the user interface and user experience design aspects of XAI. EIs aim to bridge the gap between algorithmic explanations and users by researching how to best present the explanations to users.

The paper conducts a systematic literature review of 53 publications on EI research to understand: 
1) How researchers currently involve users in XAI system design and evaluation
2) How EIs are designed, specifically the information architecture and interactivity
3) How EIs are evaluated using different metrics

Main Contributions:

- One of the first systematic surveys focusing specifically on EI research
- Found that majority of XAI papers only involve users to evaluate finished XAI prototypes rather than conducting user research to understand user needs early on
- Identified 8 key properties used to describe EI designs and evaluations: activities, participant groups, required features, visual hierarchy, information architecture, interactivity, evaluation metrics, metric types
- Discovered that common practices are: sequential information architecture, instructing interaction, system desiderata metrics 
- Proposed directions: more user research upfront, increased EI interactivity, targeted EI evaluations

In summary, the paper surveyed existing work at the intersection of XAI and HCI, analyzed the gap between algorithmic explanations and users, revealed current practices and limitations of EIs, and highlighted future opportunities to improve EI designs to meet user needs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This systematic survey of 53 publications on explainable interfaces in XAI research identifies current practices and trends in how researchers involve participants, design interfaces to convey explanations, and evaluate the usability and efficacy of those interfaces, in order to shed light on more human-centered approaches for designing interpretable AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is:

It presents a systematic survey of 53 publications to identify current trends in human-XAI interaction and promising directions for explainable interface (EI) design and development. Specifically, it focuses on how current XAI research communicates explanations to human users through EIs. This is among the first systematic surveys examining EI research.

Through three research questions, the paper examines how human participants are involved in XAI research, how EIs are currently designed, and how EIs are evaluated. It identifies 8 key properties of EIs: participant groups, design activities, required features and visual hierarchy, information architecture, interactivity type, interaction type, evaluation metrics, and metric types.

Using these properties, the authors analyze patterns in the literature, including how different user groups participate, common design requirements and outcomes, and evaluation practices. They also conduct a cluster analysis to uncover connections between the properties.

Based on the analysis, the paper discusses implications for XAI and EI research, including the need for more user research, the importance of interactivity, and suggestions for improving EI evaluation. It provides directions and opportunities for more human-centered XAI system design.

In summary, this systematic survey focuses specifically on the interaction and interface aspects of XAI systems, analyzing current practices and patterns to inform future research on making XAI explanations more usable and useful for human users.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Explainable interface (EI)
- Explainable AI (XAI) 
- Systematic review
- Design requirements
- Visual hierarchy
- Information architecture  
- Interactivity
- Interaction types
- Evaluation metrics
- ISO human-centered design process

The paper presents a systematic survey of research publications on explainable interfaces (EIs), which focuses on the user interface and user experience design aspects of explainable AI (XAI). It reviews the current trends and practices in how researchers involve human participants in XAI research, how EIs are designed, and how they are evaluated. Some of the key concepts covered include gathering design requirements, organizing information with visual hierarchy and information architecture, supporting interactivity and different interaction types in the interface, and using various evaluation metrics. The analysis is grounded in the ISO framework for human-centered design processes. The goal of the survey is to shed light on promising directions to improve the usability and efficacy of XAI systems through better explainable interface design and evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline for conducting the systematic literature review. What are some of the key benefits of using the PRISMA guideline versus developing a custom systematic review methodology? 

2. Thematic analysis and grounded theory were used to analyze the data collected in the systematic literature review. What are some of the strengths and limitations of using qualitative analysis methods like these versus quantitative analysis methods for the research questions posed in this paper?

3. Figure 1 shows the process for selecting publications to include in the analysis. What are some ways this process could be expanded or refined to capture a broader set of relevant publications on explainable interfaces? 

4. The ISO human-centered design process was used to categorize the stage at which human participants were involved in the XAI system development process. What are some limitations of mapping XAI system design processes onto this standardized design framework? 

5. Eight key properties were identified to characterize the explainable interfaces and their evaluation. What are some additional properties that could provide further insight into current practices in explainable interface design?

6. The concept of "visual hierarchy" was introduced to understand how information is organized in explainable interface designs. What are some alternative conceptual frameworks from human-computer interaction or information visualization that could be used instead? 

7. What types of new explainable interface designs might be explored by combining properties that are currently underrepresented based on the analysis, such as static interactivity with hierarchical information architecture?

8. Cluster analysis was used to identify patterns amongst the set of publications surveyed. What are some of the limitations of using modularity-based clustering for this literature analysis versus other clustering approaches?

9. The survey focuses solely on publications from the ACM Digital Library. What kinds of relevant research might be missed by limiting the search to this database? How might the key findings differ if a wider set of publication venues were included?

10. The analysis relies primarily on what researchers have chosen to report in their publications. What methods could help address gaps in knowledge about actual user research practices that may not be fully captured in the published articles?
