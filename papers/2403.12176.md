## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of lack of interpretability and explainability in end-to-end autonomous vehicles, which impedes user trust and widespread deployment. Particularly, the issue becomes more serious when self-driving cars are involved in accidents, raising safety concerns. However, safety and explainability have been studied separately in autonomous driving research. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper bridges the gap between safety and explainability in self-driving vehicles. It investigates the research question - "When and how can explanations improve safety of autonomous driving?". The solutions explored include:

1) Revisiting established safety principles and state-of-the-art explainability techniques in autonomous driving. 

2) Presenting analytical case studies showing the pivotal role of explanations in enhancing self-driving safety, both in real-time and post-hoc.

3) Performing an empirical study on the "explainability-informed safety assessment", revealing potential value, limitations and caveats of practical explainable AI methods for assuring safety.

Main Contributions:

1) First work investigating safety assurance of explainable AI in autonomous vehicles.

2) Guidelines provided can help improve self-driving safety and build trustworthy autonomous systems.

3) Analytical case studies demonstrate value of explanations for control, enhancement, defense and compliance.  

4) Empirical analysis shows robustness of explanations against adversarial questions contributes to cybersecurity.

5) Limitations revealed include incorrect explanations for unsafe behaviors being most undesirable.

In summary, the paper comprehensively explores augmenting autonomous driving safety via explainable AI through theory, case studies and experiments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper discusses various time granularities for delivering explanations in autonomous vehicles, from immediate feedback to post-trip analysis. What are some key criteria and considerations for determining the appropriate timing of explanations for maximum safety benefit? 

2) The paper covers several analytical case studies showing how explanations can improve safety. Can you describe another realistic scenario where explanations could help avoid an accident or dangerous situation with an autonomous vehicle?

3) The paper categorizes driving scenarios into proactive/reactive and critical/non-critical when designing real-time explanatory feedback. Are there any additional categories that should be considered from a safety perspective when conveying in-vehicle explanations?  

4) The paper argues explanations can help comply with regulations and gain approval for autonomous vehicles. What are some specific regulatory guidelines or approval processes that explanations could facilitate?

5) The experimental analysis reveals limitations of explanation systems, like incorrect responses to adversarial questions. What steps should be taken during the development and evaluation of explanation systems to ensure safety and robustness?  

6) The paper focuses on natural language explanations for human interpretability. What are some challenges and open research questions around evaluating sentiment, tone and terminology of linguistic explanations for maximum clarity?

7) The analytical case studies highlight post-accident investigations. What data and log information should autonomous vehicles record to enable thorough forensic analysis with explanations after a crash?

8) The paper discusses cybersecurity issues but does not detail how explanations could mitigate threats. What types of attacks could explanations potentially help defend against?

9) The paper emphasizes takeover situations and human intervention enabled by explanations. What interface design considerations should be made to ensure effective and rapid handoff of control?

10) The paper introduces some large pretrained language models for self-driving explainability. How can we ensure these models provide correct explanations aligned with visual evidence and avoid "hallucinated" rationales?
