# [ColloSSL: Collaborative Self-Supervised Learning for Human Activity   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00758)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we leverage unlabeled inertial sensor data collected simultaneously from multiple on-body devices worn by a user to learn good representations of human activity data in a self-supervised manner?The key hypothesis is that the time-aligned unlabeled sensor data from multiple on-body devices can be considered as natural transformations of each other. By exploiting this, the paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach called Collaborative Self-Supervised Learning (ColloSSL) which uses the unlabeled multi-device data to generate supervision signals for representation learning.In summary, the core research question and hypothesis are:Research Question: How to perform self-supervised representation learning using unlabeled inertial data from multiple on-body devices? Hypothesis: The time-aligned multi-device data provides natural transformations that can generate supervision for contrastive self-supervised learning.The paper aims to validate this hypothesis by proposing the ColloSSL framework for multi-device self-supervised learning, and showing its effectiveness for human activity recognition compared to supervised and semi-supervised baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new self-supervised learning method called Collaborative Self-Supervised Learning (ColloSSL) for human activity recognition (HAR) using unlabeled sensor data from multiple on-body devices. 2. It identifies and addresses three key challenges in adapting contrastive self-supervised learning to the multi-device setting: device selection, contrastive sampling, and defining a multi-view contrastive loss. Novel algorithms are proposed for device selection, contrastive sampling, and a new multi-view contrastive loss is introduced.3. It presents an end-to-end framework that first uses ColloSSL on unlabeled multi-device data to learn feature representations, followed by training an activity classifier on a small labeled dataset.4. Through evaluations on 3 multi-device datasets, it shows that ColloSSL outperforms supervised and semi-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy and data-efficiency. For example, using 10% labeled data, ColloSSL outperforms fully-supervised methods trained on 100% labeled data.5. Analysis and visualizations demonstrate that ColloSSL can learn meaningful and well-separable feature representations. The method is also shown to be robust to sensor heterogeneity, temporal misalignments, and missing device data.In summary, the key idea is to leverage natural transformations in multi-device data as a supervisory signal for contrastive self-supervised learning, instead of relying on manual transformations as done in prior SSL work. The proposed ColloSSL framework operationalizes this idea through novel algorithms for device selection, sampling, and loss computation in the multi-device setting.
