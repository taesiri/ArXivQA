# [ComOM at VLSP 2023: A Dual-Stage Framework with BERTology and Unified   Multi-Task Instruction Tuning Model for Vietnamese Comparative Opinion Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09000)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the task of comparative opinion mining (ComOM) from Vietnamese product reviews. This involves two sub-tasks: (1) Identifying whether a review sentence is comparative (Comparative Sentence Identification - CSI); and (2) Extracting comparative opinion quintuples from comparative sentences (Comparative Element Extraction - CEE). A comparative opinion quintuple consists of the subject, object, aspect, predicate, and comparison label. The goal is to extract these quintuples, along with the corresponding text spans and indexes, from comparative review sentences.

Proposed Solution:
A two-stage framework is proposed:

Stage 1 (CSI): A binary classification model based on fine-tuning the PhoBERT language model is used to identify comparative sentences.

Stage 2 (CEE): 
- Formulates CEE as a text generation task based on templates.
- Employs a multi-task instruction tuning strategy to fine-tune T5 models by designing descriptive prompts for sub-tasks that extract different combinations of the quintuple elements. 
- Applies a simple data augmentation technique to increase diversity of training data.
- Uses fuzzy string matching and rules to map extracted text spans back to original indexes.

The viT5 model gave the best performance when fine-tuned with multi-task instructions and data augmentation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel formulation of CEE as a text generation problem combined with multi-task instruction tuning.
- Data augmentation strategy to improve diversity of training data.  
- State-of-the-art results on the ComOM VLSP 2023 benchmark, outperforming other systems. The proposed approach achieved top position on the competition's private test leaderboard.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective two-stage framework for comparative opinion mining from Vietnamese reviews, with the key novelty being the use of multi-task instruction tuning and data augmentation for the comparative element extraction sub-task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-stage system with binary classification to identify comparative sentences and multi-task instruction tuning on augmented data to extract comparative opinion quintuples from Vietnamese product reviews, achieving top performance in the VLSP 2023 shared task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a two-stage system for comparative opinion mining from Vietnamese product reviews. Specifically:

1) The authors propose a binary classification model using PhoBERT to identify comparative sentences (stage 1). 

2) For comparative element extraction (stage 2), they present an end-to-end multi-task instruction tuning model based on T5 to predict the opinion quintuples. They also apply data augmentation to increase the training data. 

3) Experimental results show their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other competitors on the VLSP 2023 shared task and achieving the top score on the private test set.

In summary, the key innovation is the multi-task instruction tuning strategy combined with data augmentation, which allows their model to effectively extract comparative opinions from Vietnamese reviews. The top results on the competition benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed techniques.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage framework consisting of comparative sentence identification and comparative element extraction. Can you explain in detail the motivation behind using a two-stage approach instead of an end-to-end model? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages?

2. For the first stage, several BERT-based models are experimented with. What factors contribute to PhoBERTv2 achieving the best performance for comparative sentence identification? How was PhoBERTv2 pre-trained differently compared to the other models?

3. In the second stage, both multi-lingual T5 (mT5) and mono-lingual viT5 models are evaluated. Why does viT5 consistently outperform mT5? What differences in the pre-training data and objectives lead to this result? 

4. The paper proposes a data augmentation technique to improve model performance. Can you explain the motivation and approach taken for data augmentation? How exactly does this technique help improve performance?

5. Multi-task instruction tuning is also proposed in stage 2. Explain what multi-task learning means and how the different sub-tasks are formulated. Why is there hypothesized to be useful correlation information between the different sub-tasks?

6. Analyze the results in Table 2. Why does multi-task instruction tuning alone outperform data augmentation alone? Why does combining both techniques lead to the overall best results? What conclusions can you draw about the utility of each proposed component?  

7. The paper achieves state-of-the-art results on the private test set leaderboard. Analyze the differences between the top 5 ranked teams in Table 3. What factors contribute to the authors' solution outperforming the others?

8. The task involves extracting opinion quintuples (subject, object, aspect, predicate, comparison label) from text. Discuss potential challenges this presents compared to standard named entity recognition tasks. How does the ordering information increase task complexity?

9. The paper transforms the quintuple extraction into a text generation task, generating descriptive templates. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of formulating it as a generation rather than span detection problem.

10. The authors mention future plans to experiment with larger Vietnamese language models like PhoGPT and LLaMa-2. Explain why this could further improve performance and discuss any potential challenges in leveraging such models.
