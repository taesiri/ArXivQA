# [ComOM at VLSP 2023: A Dual-Stage Framework with BERTology and Unified   Multi-Task Instruction Tuning Model for Vietnamese Comparative Opinion Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09000)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the task of comparative opinion mining (ComOM) from Vietnamese product reviews. This involves two sub-tasks: (1) Identifying whether a review sentence is comparative (Comparative Sentence Identification - CSI); and (2) Extracting comparative opinion quintuples from comparative sentences (Comparative Element Extraction - CEE). A comparative opinion quintuple consists of the subject, object, aspect, predicate, and comparison label. The goal is to extract these quintuples, along with the corresponding text spans and indexes, from comparative review sentences.

Proposed Solution:
A two-stage framework is proposed:

Stage 1 (CSI): A binary classification model based on fine-tuning the PhoBERT language model is used to identify comparative sentences.

Stage 2 (CEE): 
- Formulates CEE as a text generation task based on templates.
- Employs a multi-task instruction tuning strategy to fine-tune T5 models by designing descriptive prompts for sub-tasks that extract different combinations of the quintuple elements. 
- Applies a simple data augmentation technique to increase diversity of training data.
- Uses fuzzy string matching and rules to map extracted text spans back to original indexes.

The viT5 model gave the best performance when fine-tuned with multi-task instructions and data augmentation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel formulation of CEE as a text generation problem combined with multi-task instruction tuning.
- Data augmentation strategy to improve diversity of training data.  
- State-of-the-art results on the ComOM VLSP 2023 benchmark, outperforming other systems. The proposed approach achieved top position on the competition's private test leaderboard.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective two-stage framework for comparative opinion mining from Vietnamese reviews, with the key novelty being the use of multi-task instruction tuning and data augmentation for the comparative element extraction sub-task.
