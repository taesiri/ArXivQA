# [Weight-Entanglement Meets Gradient-Based Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10440)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper bridges the gap between two popular neural architecture search (NAS) paradigms - weight sharing (WS) and weight entanglement (WE). WS is used in cell-based search spaces and enables efficient gradient-based NAS methods. WE enables memory-efficient weight sharing in macro search spaces and is used in two-stage NAS methods. However, gradient-based NAS has not been explored for WE search spaces.

The paper proposes a scheme called TangleNAS to enable gradient-based NAS methods to work with WE search spaces. This is done by superimposing the weights of smaller operations into the weights of the largest operation. During forwarding, only the largest operation needs to be computed while implicitly evaluating all options. 

Experiments are conducted on diverse search spaces - cell-based spaces like NAS-Bench-201, macro spaces for CNNs and Transformers. Comparisons are done to both WS and WE baselines. The results demonstrate superior performance over the baselines in terms of efficiency, anytime performance and efficacy across search spaces.

The key contributions are:
1) Proposing weight superposition to enable single-stage NAS for WE spaces
2) Providing open-source benchmark implementations of toy search spaces to facilitate NAS research 
3) Extensive experiments demonstrating the advantages of using WS for cell spaces and WE for macro spaces
4) Empirical analysis of properties of single-stage vs two-stage NAS across search spaces.

In summary, the paper enables the complementarity of ideas from two disjoint NAS communities to enhance neural architecture search. The released code and benchmarks facilitate further research in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel scheme to apply gradient-based neural architecture search methods to macro-level search spaces with weight entanglement, bridging the gap between the parallel sub-communities of single-stage NAS for cell-based spaces and two-stage NAS for weight-entangled spaces; through comprehensive experiments across diverse search spaces, the proposed approach is shown to combine the benefits of enhanced performance and training properties from single-stage methods with the memory efficiency of two-stage methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel scheme to adapt gradient-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods for weight-entangled macro search spaces. Specifically, the paper:

1) Proposes a generalized scheme called TangleNAS that allows single-stage, gradient-based NAS methods to be applied to weight-entangled macro search spaces, while maintaining efficiency. This bridges the gap between the typically separate communities using weight sharing vs weight entanglement.

2) Evaluates TangleNAS extensively across diverse search spaces and tasks, including image classification (AutoFormer, MobileNetV3), language modeling (GPT variant), as well as cell-based search spaces. It is shown to outperform conventional two-stage methods.

3) Conducts comprehensive analysis comparing properties of single-stage (TangleNAS) and two-stage methods. This includes anytime performance, robustness to training data fraction, effect of fine-tuning, etc. The key benefits of both approaches are shown to be combined in TangleNAS.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and thorough evaluation of TangleNAS, a scheme to unlock the benefits of single-stage NAS methods for macro search spaces with weight entanglement. This helps combine the advantages of two previously disparate NAS subfields.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed "combi-superposition" operation in Algorithm 1 enable the application of single-stage NAS methods like DARTS to macro-level search spaces with multiple interacting architectural choices (e.g. embedding dimension and expansion ratio)?

2. Why is directly applying off-the-shelf single-stage NAS methods ineffective for macro-level spaces? What modifications were made in TangleNAS to address these challenges?

3. The paper proposes using weight superposition instead of weighted aggregation of operation outputs in single-stage methods. What are the space and time complexity benefits of this approach over vanilla single-stage NAS?

4. How exactly does TangleNAS maintain the memory efficiency of two-stage methods while getting the benefits of single-stage methods? Elaborate on the weight superposition idea.  

5. The paper demonstrates strong anytime performance of TangleNAS over methods like AutoFormer. What factors contribute to this superior anytime performance?

6. How does TangleNAS stabilize the high variance in architecture parameters across epochs in macro spaces? Explain techniques like progressive shrinking and warmup.

7. Why is TangleNAS more robust to changes in train-validation splits compared to two-stage methods? Elaborate with empirical evidence.

8. Explain the differences in optimal architecture insights obtained via TangleNAS on vision transformers, CNNs and LMs. How do these align or differ from hand-designed architectures?

9. The CKA analysis reveals higher similarity between inherited and retrained weights for TangleNAS than two-stage methods. Why does this matter, especially for proxy-based searches?

10. How does the combi-superposition idea generalize single-stage NAS methods to multi-dimensional macro spaces? Could this idea be extended to other NAS algorithms like GDAS or PCDARTS?
