# [Weight-Entanglement Meets Gradient-Based Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10440)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper bridges the gap between two popular neural architecture search (NAS) paradigms - weight sharing (WS) and weight entanglement (WE). WS is used in cell-based search spaces and enables efficient gradient-based NAS methods. WE enables memory-efficient weight sharing in macro search spaces and is used in two-stage NAS methods. However, gradient-based NAS has not been explored for WE search spaces.

The paper proposes a scheme called TangleNAS to enable gradient-based NAS methods to work with WE search spaces. This is done by superimposing the weights of smaller operations into the weights of the largest operation. During forwarding, only the largest operation needs to be computed while implicitly evaluating all options. 

Experiments are conducted on diverse search spaces - cell-based spaces like NAS-Bench-201, macro spaces for CNNs and Transformers. Comparisons are done to both WS and WE baselines. The results demonstrate superior performance over the baselines in terms of efficiency, anytime performance and efficacy across search spaces.

The key contributions are:
1) Proposing weight superposition to enable single-stage NAS for WE spaces
2) Providing open-source benchmark implementations of toy search spaces to facilitate NAS research 
3) Extensive experiments demonstrating the advantages of using WS for cell spaces and WE for macro spaces
4) Empirical analysis of properties of single-stage vs two-stage NAS across search spaces.

In summary, the paper enables the complementarity of ideas from two disjoint NAS communities to enhance neural architecture search. The released code and benchmarks facilitate further research in this area.
