# [An Image-based Typology for Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05594)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of categorization of visualization images based on their visual appearance and essential visual stimuli rather than the underlying data, tasks, or construction techniques used to create them. Such a categorization can provide new perspectives to analyze and understand visualizations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an image-based visualization typology called "VisImageTypes" consisting of 10 categories that characterize the visual appearance and essential stimuli of visualization images:
  1. Generalized bar representations
  2. Point-based representations  
  3. Line-based representations
  4. Node-link trees/graphs  
  5. Generalized area representations
  6. Surface & volume representations
  7. Generalized matrix/grid  
  8. Continuous color representations
  9. Glyph-based representations
  10. Text-based representations

- They analyzed and manually labeled over 6,800 IEEE VIS images using this typology through an iterative coding process over several years.

- They provide quantitative analysis of the distribution and evolution of these 10 types over 30 years.

- They validated the typology through a user study where 110 visualization experts identified images of the 10 types with over 80% accuracy on average.

Main Contributions:

- A novel methodology to categorize visualization images based solely on their visual appearance rather than construction techniques, underlying data or tasks.  

- A visualization typology ("VisImageTypes") consisting of 10 categories that capture essential visual stimuli.

- A dataset of over 6,800 manually labeled IEEE VIS images following this typology.

- Quantitative analysis of distribution and evolution of these visualization types.

- Validation through a user study demonstrating visualization experts can reliably apply these categories.

- Discussion of inherent difficulties and limitations in visual categorization. 

- Proposal of use cases enabled by this typology like analyzing evolution of representations, developing new evaluation methods focused on visual encodings, studying visual literacy, and working towards standardization.

In summary, it provides a systematic perspective to categorize and analyze visualization images based on visual appearance rather than traditional notions of data, tasks or construction techniques. The labeled dataset and proposed typology open up new possibilities for visualization research and practice.
