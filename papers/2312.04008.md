# [Natural-language-driven Simulation Benchmark and Copilot for Efficient   Production of Object Interactions in Virtual Road Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04008)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes the idea of using natural language to efficiently simulate complex object interactions in virtual road scenes to generate data for training and testing autonomous vehicles. The authors collect a dataset called Language-to-Interaction (L2I) with 120,000 examples mapping natural language descriptions to programming code to simulate ego car interactions with obstacles like cars and pedestrians in different road topologies. They propose a model called SimCopilot that translates natural language descriptions into code to simulate interactions. SimCopilot incorporates modules to capture motion, interaction, and road topology features to help generate accurate and realistic simulations. The authors benchmark SimCopilot on L2I for translating motions, generating complex multi-object interactions, and generalizing across road types. Results motivate future research into language-driven simulation for efficient synthesis of critical driving scenarios and adversarial test cases for self-driving vehicles. Overall, the paper offers a novel direction to use language models for simulation in lieu of traditional visual or programming approaches that require heavy human effort.
