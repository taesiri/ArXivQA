# [A Critical Review of Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00019)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can recurrent neural networks (RNNs) effectively model sequential data and learn long-range dependencies, overcoming issues like vanishing gradients that plagued earlier RNN models?

2) Have advances in RNN architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation made it feasible to successfully train RNNs on complex real-world sequence learning tasks? 

3) Can Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional RNN (BRNN) architectures in particular achieve state-of-the-art results on important tasks involving sequential data?

4) Can techniques like neural Turing machines extend RNN capabilities even further for certain algorithmic tasks?

5) What are the current state-of-the-art results using RNNs and related architectures on key applications like machine translation, image/video captioning, speech recognition, etc?

The paper seems to provide a comprehensive survey of RNN research to date to address these questions. It covers the motivation for RNNs, the challenges faced, the modern architectures that have been most successful, and the application areas where RNNs have demonstrated their capabilities and limitations. The central goal appears to be assessing whether and how much RNNs have advanced as practical tools for sequential supervised learning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on recurrent neural networks (RNNs):

- It provides a broad survey of RNN architectures, algorithms, and applications. Many papers focus on a specific model or task, while this reviews the field more comprehensively.

- The paper aims to provide intuition and qualitative arguments for RNNs, in addition to quantitative results. Much RNN research is highly technical and empirical. This tries to extract general lessons.

- The review reconciles conflicting notation and terminology in the literature. Many papers overload notation in conflicting ways, making it hard to synthesize research. This survey clarifies notation.

- The paper connects RNN research to cognitive science and neuroscience. It draws parallels between concepts like memory cells and human working memory. Some RNN research ignores biological connections.

- There is a focus on modern LSTM and bidirectional architectures rather than earlier, less powerful RNN models. The review concentrates on techniques that drive current state-of-the-art results.

- Attention is given to difficulties in training, like vanishing gradients. The paper discusses techniques to overcome training challenges in detail. Some reviews ignore these practical issues.

- The survey covers major application areas for RNNs like translation, captioning and time series. It demonstrates how tasks can be formulated as sequence learning problems.

Overall, this review provides a more holistic perspective on RNN research compared to papers focused on individual models or applications. It offers useful high-level synthesis in addition to technical details.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions:

- Automating exploration of model architectures through techniques like genetic algorithms or MCMC. This could help efficiently search the large space of possible RNN architectures.

- Developing better evaluation metrics and fitness functions. Metrics like BLEU have weaknesses, so more reliable ways to evaluate complex tasks like translation would be useful. When possible, new techniques should first be evaluated on simpler feedforward networks before applying them to RNNs.

- Applying RNNs to longer texts beyond the short sentences typically used in experiments. Areas like dialogue systems could benefit from RNNs that can model long conversations.

- Extensions to the sequence-to-sequence models used for translation and captioning, for example to build dialogue systems where conversation history is retained as context.

- Improving techniques to exploit sparsity in RNNs, like extending methods developed for sparse linear models.

- Better understanding the loss surfaces and optimization challenges for training RNNs. Techniques like saddle-free Newton methods seem promising for improving training.

In summary, the main directions mentioned are 1) automating architecture search, 2) improving evaluation metrics/fitness functions, 3) extending RNNs to longer sequences and texts, 4) exploiting sparsity, and 5) improving training procedures. The authors suggest RNNs have significant potential for further applications involving sequences.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their applications in sequence learning. It begins by explaining the motivation for RNNs - they overcome limitations of standard feedforward networks by being able to model sequential data where inputs are related across time steps. The paper then provides background on neural networks and training techniques like backpropagation. It introduces early RNN architectures like Elman networks and Jordan networks, and explains challenges in training RNNs like the vanishing gradient problem. The main sections describe modern RNN architectures - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks which overcome vanishing gradients, Bidirectional RNNs that incorporate both past and future context, and Neural Turing Machines with external memory. The paper then surveys applications where these architectures have driven progress - in natural language translation, image/video captioning, and other domains. Throughout, the authors aim to provide intuitions and reconcile conflicting notation and terminology in the RNN literature.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of recurrent neural networks, starting from foundations and early history and bringing readers up to date on modern architectures, training techniques, and applications. It serves both as a reference for experts and an introduction for those looking to learn about RNNs.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper provides a review and synthesis of research on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence learning. The key innovations that have enabled RNNs to achieve state-of-the-art performance across a variety of sequence modeling tasks are long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures and bidirectional RNNs. LSTMs were introduced to overcome the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, allowing models to learn long-range dependencies. They include memory cells with recurrent self-connections that allow gradients to flow unchanged across many time steps. Bidirectional RNNs augment standard RNNs by having hidden layers that process the sequence both backwards and forwards, allowing the output at each timestep to take into account both past and future context. The combination of these two techniques in bidirectional LSTM models has driven much of the recent progress in sequence learning tasks like machine translation, image captioning, and speech recognition. The paper provides a comprehensive review of the development of these methods along with an examination of their application to real-world problems.
