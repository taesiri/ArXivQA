# [Neural Video Compression with Diverse Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14402)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can neural video compression be improved by utilizing diverse contexts more efficiently? 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Increasing context diversity both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within a frame) can improve compression efficiency for neural video codecs. 

2) Guiding the model to learn hierarchical quality patterns across frames can help extract higher quality long-term contexts to improve temporal compression.

3) Using group-based offset diversity can provide more robust motion-aligned contexts to handle complex motions. 

4) Adopting a quadtree-based spatial partitioning scheme can increase spatial context diversity for more efficient entropy coding.

5) These techniques to increase diverse contexts can significantly improve compression efficiency without substantially increasing computational complexity.

The authors propose techniques along these lines, including hierarchical quality learning, group-based offset diversity, and quadtree partitioning. Their experiments demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques, achieving state-of-the-art compression performance while reducing computational costs compared to prior art. The central hypothesis is that efficiently increasing context diversity is key to pushing neural video codec performance.
