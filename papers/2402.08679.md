# [COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08679)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It formulates the controllable attack generation problem and connects it to controllable text generation, bridging the domains of adversarial attacks on LLMs and controllable NLP. This perspective allows adapting algorithms from controllable text generation to generate diverse and controllable LLM attacks.

2. It introduces COLD-Attack, which adapts the COLD algorithm for controllable text generation to enable efficient search for adversarial prompts under various controls like fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. COLD-Attack automates the search through an energy-based formulation.

3. It demonstrates COLD-Attack's capabilities through comprehensive experiments under various attack settings like fluent suffix attacks, paraphrase attacks, and attacks with left-right-coherence control. The results showcase COLD-Attack's strengths in attack success rates, fluency, and ability to enforce control requirements.

In summary, the main contribution is a new energy-based perspective that unifies and automates the search for controlled and stealthy adversarial attacks on LLMs, enabled by adapting state-of-the-art techniques from the field of controllable text generation.
