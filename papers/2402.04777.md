# [A fast score-based search algorithm for maximal ancestral graphs using   entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Learning causal graphs from data is important for causal inference, but challenging when there are unmeasured confounders. 
- Maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) can represent causal relationships with latent variables, extending directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
- Most methods for learning MAGs use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score, which is unstable and computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a score-based algorithm called GESMAG to greedily learn MAGs by searching over Markov equivalence classes, represented by partial ancestral graphs (PAGs).
- They score PAGs using an imset constructed from the refined Markov property, measuring discrepancies between conditional independences in the PAG and empirical estimates of conditional mutual information. This score is shown to be consistent.
- The search procedure starts from the empty graph, adds adjacencies, deletes adjacencies, and finally changes edge marks, creating branches when discriminating paths emerge. 
- Theoretical results based on assuming a MAG version of Meek's conjecture allow the search to be simplified in certain cases.

Main Contributions:
- A consistent scoring criterion based on imsets and empirical entropy estimates, avoiding expensive model fitting procedures.
- An improved search strategy over Markov equivalence classes of MAGs, with modifications to accelerate the traversal.
- Theoretical results allowing the complexity of the search procedure to be bounded under certain graphical assumptions.
- Empirical experiments demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art MAG learning algorithms in terms of structural accuracy and model quality.

In summary, the authors make several innovative contributions concerning scoring criteria, search strategies, theoretical analyses and an extensive empirical evaluation to develop a method for learning MAGs that is both accurate and efficient compared to previous approaches.
