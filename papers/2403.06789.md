# [SPLADE-v3: New baselines for SPLADE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06789)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The authors released a newer version (v3) of the open-source SPLADE library for dense passage retrieval. They wanted to document the improvements in this new version and provide better baselines to the community.

Proposed Solution:
- They made several enhancements to the SPLADE training procedure, including using more hard negatives per batch, better distillation scores from an ensemble of cross-encoders, combining two distillation losses, and further fine-tuning.

- This led to a new model series called SPLADE-v3. The base model starts from a SPLADE++ checkpoint and is further trained with the improvements mentioned above.

- They also released 3 other variants: SPLADE-v3-DistilBERT (smaller model), SPLADE-v3-Lexical (no query expansion for efficiency), and SPLADE-v3-Doc (no query encoding).

Contributions:

- Extensive evaluations showing SPLADE-v3 statistically significantly outperforms BM25 and previous SPLADE iterations in most cases.

- It achieves over 40 MRR@10 on MS MARCO and 50+ average nDCG@10 on BEIR benchmark.

- It also compares competitively to cross-encoder rerankers like MiniLM and DeBERTaV3 when reranking SPLADE-v3's results.

- The 3 model variants provide different efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs.

Overall, this paper introduced impactful improvements to SPLADE training and established much stronger baselines with the SPLADE-v3 model series, available in the open-source library.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces SPLADE-v3, a new series of neural retrieval models that outperforms previous SPLADE iterations as well as BM25 across a wide range of datasets while comparing competitively to cross-encoder rerankers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

The release and evaluation of a new series of SPLADE models called SPLADE-v3. Specifically:

- SPLADE-v3 incorporates several improvements to the training procedure of SPLADE models, including using more negatives per batch, better distillation scores from an ensemble of cross-encoders, combining two distillation losses, and fine-tuning from a SPLADE++ checkpoint. 

- Through extensive experiments over 44 diverse query sets, SPLADE-v3 is shown to significantly outperform both BM25 and the previous SPLADE++SelfDistil model. It also compares competitively to cross-encoder rerankers like MiniLM and DeBERTaV3.

- In addition to SPLADE-v3, three variants are released - SPLADE-v3-DistilBERT, SPLADE-v3-Lexical, and SPLADE-v3-Doc - that make efficiency and effectiveness tradeoffs.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting SPLADE-v3 as a new strong baseline for the SPLADE family of models, with extensive experimentation demonstrating its improved effectiveness over prior versions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using an ensemble of cross-encoder re-rankers to generate distillation scores. What specific models were used in this ensemble and why were they chosen? How much does using an ensemble improve results over using scores from just a single cross-encoder model?

2. The paper trains models with a mix of KL divergence and margin MSE loss for distillation. Why does using both losses lead to better effectiveness compared to using just one? What is the intuition behind how each loss complements the other? 

3. The paper finds that starting from a SPLADE++SelfDistil checkpoint leads to better results compared to starting from a CoCondenser or DistilBERT checkpoint. Why might this curriculum learning approach be beneficial? Are there any hypotheses about the underlying reasons?

4. How many hard negatives per query are used during training? Is there an optimal number or does increasing negatives monotonically improve performance? What are the tradeoffs in using more negatives?

5. What query expansion techniques are used in SPLADE-v3 and how do they compare to the lexical variant without expansion? What types of queries benefit more from expansion in terms of effectiveness?

6. How much efficiency gain is there in SPLADE-v3-Lexical by removing query expansion? What other techniques could be used to improve efficiency further? 

7. The paper shows SPLADE-v3 outperforming BM25 significantly across many datasets. For which types of queries or datasets does SPLADE still underperform traditional BM25? Why might this be the case?

8. How well does SPLADE-v3 compare to state-of-the-art cross-encoder rankers for document re-ranking? In what scenarios does it outperform or underperform them?

9. The paper evaluates on 44 diverse query sets. Are there any consistent trends across query sets where SPLADE does well or poorly compared to other methods? How could SPLADE be improved for problematic domains?

10. For real-world search applications, what efficiency-effectiveness tradeoffs exist between different SPLADE model variations like the DistilBERT and lexical versions? How might production systems choose between them?
