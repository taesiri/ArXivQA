# [HOKEM: Human and Object Keypoint-based Extension Module for Human-Object   Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14260)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the research paper:

This paper presents HOKEM, a human and object keypoint-based extension module to improve the accuracy of human-object interaction (HOI) detection models. HOKEM introduces a novel object keypoint extraction method to accurately represent the shapes of varied objects using instance segmentation and contour information. It also proposes a human-object adaptive graph convolutional network (HO-AGCN) to capture relationships between human and object keypoints. Specifically, HO-AGCN optimizes the predefined graph topology while featuring an attention mechanism to focus on informative keypoints. Experiments demonstrate HOKEM's ability to boost an appearance-based HOI detection baseline by approximately 5 mAP on the V-COCO dataset. The proposed module can be conveniently integrated into existing models by multiplying output probabilities. Main advantages include strong performance gains, wide model compatibility as an extensible module, effective object shape representation, and relational reasoning via graph convolutions across keypoints. In summary, HOKEM advances the state-of-the-art in HOI understanding through robust object modeling and relational graph networks for increased detection accuracy.
