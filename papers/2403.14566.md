# [A survey on Concept-based Approaches For Model Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14566)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A survey on Concept-Based Approaches for Model Improvement":

Problem:
With the increasing use of deep learning models, there is a need to make them more interpretable and explainable to humans. Concept-based approaches have emerged as a promising direction where models are explained in terms of human-understandable "concepts". The landscape of concept representations and discovery methods is rich and varied. Some recent works have also focused on using concepts to improve model performance. 

Solution:
This paper provides a systematic taxonomy and review of concept representation methods including non-hierarchical (concept vectors, prototypes, etc.) and hierarchical (graphs, trees). It also categorizes concept discovery methods into post-hoc (based on superpixels, causality, etc.) and ante-hoc (saliency maps, slot attention, GANs). 

The paper introduces the paradigm of Concept-Oriented Deep Learning (CODL) which uses concept supervision to enhance interpretability and performance. It provides a categorization of CODL techniques for model improvement into:
(i) Better interpretability - Concept conditioned prediction, concept reasoning, interaction-based
(ii) Better generalization - CAV-based, causality-based, latent space disentanglement

Contributions:
- Taxonomy of concept representations and discovery algorithms
- First comprehensive survey of concept-based model improvement literature 
- Introduction to evaluation metrics for discovered concepts
- Categorization of model improvement methods by goal (interpretability vs generalization)
- Discussion of applications of CODL in vision and future directions

The paper provides a broad overview connecting the areas of concept-based interpretability, concept discovery, and concept-oriented learning for model improvement.
