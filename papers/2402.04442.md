# [Evaluating Embeddings for One-Shot Classification of Doctor-AI   Consultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04442)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Effective communication between doctors and patients is important for quality healthcare. AI-assisted medical consultations are becoming more common.
- Text generated from doctor-AI consultations needs to be classified for various applications like authorship identification, medical record management, and evaluating legitimacy of online medical advice. 
- Developing text representations (embeddings) that can capture semantic features from medical consultations without much training data is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate various embedding techniques like bag-of-words, character n-grams, Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText and GPT2 embeddings using one-shot classification systems.
- Test combination of these embeddings with classification models like logistic regression, SVM, random forest, Naive Bayes, decision trees, gradient boosting and MLP. 
- Analyze model performance using accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores on three Doctor-AI consultation datasets.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of how different embeddings impact one-shot classification of Doctor vs AI generated text in medical consultations. 
- Development of multiple one-shot classification systems to distinguish doctor and AI text without needing much training data.  
- Evaluation of both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
- Identification of Word2Vec, GloVe and Character n-grams as well-suited embeddings, and GPT2 as promising for this task. 
- Demonstrated machine learning architectures can significantly improve quality of health conversations when training data is scarce.

In summary, the key innovation is leveraging various embeddings with one-shot classification systems to model doctor-AI consultations, enhancing communication and online medical advice.
