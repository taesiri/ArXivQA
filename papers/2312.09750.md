# [Attention-Based VR Facial Animation with Visual Mouth Camera Guidance   for Immersive Telepresence Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09750)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Facial animation in virtual reality (VR) is challenging due to limited and occluded camera views from VR headsets. This makes it difficult to generate realistic and temporally consistent facial animations.
- Existing VR facial animation methods require significant operator-specific training data and preprocessing which limits instant applicability.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose a facial animation pipeline that works for unseen operators with only a quick enrollment step.
- They use an attention mechanism over multiple fixed source images of the operator to improve temporal consistency. 
- A visual mouth camera guidance mechanism is introduced to resolve ambiguities in mouth movements by warping the mouth camera image into the source view. This allows modeling a broader range of mouth expressions.
- Mouth camera emulate is used during training on large-scale datasets to simulate the VR headset effects.

Main Contributions:
- Source image attention mechanism that improves temporal consistency and accuracy.
- Efficient way to incorporate visual mouth camera information to expand range of facial expressions modeled. 
- Method to emulate mouth camera data during training to enable use of available large-scale datasets.

- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art facial animation quality and temporal consistency benchmarks. It contributed to the first place victory of Team NimbRo in the ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition finals.

In summary, the paper presents an effective VR facial animation pipeline using attention and mouth camera guidance that generalizes to unseen operators with minimal data requirements. The high quality and low latency results showcase its applicability for realistic VR avatar systems.
