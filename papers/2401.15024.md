# [SliceGPT: Compress Large Language Models by Deleting Rows and Columns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15024)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have billions of parameters, making them expensive to deploy and use. Model compression techniques like pruning can reduce the size of models to make them more efficient, but most techniques hurt performance or are still inefficient to run. 

Solution - SliceGPT:
The paper proposes SliceGPT, a new compression technique that directly reduces the embedding dimension of each layer in a transformer model. It works by:

1) Exploiting a "computational invariance" property of transformers connected with RMSNorm, which allows applying an orthogonal transform to signals between layers without changing model predictions. 

2) Using this property to transform each layer's signals onto their principal components and truncate insignificant components. This is done by computing a different orthogonal transform matrix per layer using PCA on calibration data.

3) Replacing each original weight matrix with a smaller one by slicing away rows/columns corresponding to truncated components. This reduces all weight matrices rather than introducing unstructured sparsity.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the idea of computational invariance in transformers and shows how it can enable structured compression

- Proposes SliceGPT, which exploits this to directly reduce embedding dimensions and replace matrices with smaller dense ones

- Shows sliced OPT, LLama and Phi models maintain 99%, 96%, 90% dense performance even when removing 25% of parameters

- Demonstrates inference speedups, e.g. compressed LLama-70B runs 1.55x faster on consumer GPUs without extra optimization

- Shows recovery fine-tuning can further improve performance of sliced smaller models like Phi-2

Overall, SliceGPT provides an effective new compression technique for large transformers, directly reducing dimensions and model size while maintaining high performance and efficiency. The computational invariance insight may inspire more advanced transformer compression approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

SliceGPT compresses large language models by deleting rows and columns of weight matrices using principal component analysis to reduce computational requirements while maintaining high performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the idea of "computational invariance" - that orthogonal matrix transformations can be applied to the weights of a transformer network without changing the model output.

2. It uses this idea to compute different orthogonal transformations at each layer of the network using PCA on the layer outputs. This projects the signals onto their principal components.

3. It then deletes minor principal components, which corresponds to removing rows/columns from the weight matrices. This method, called SliceGPT, reduces the embedding dimension and model size.

4. Through experiments on OPT, LLama, and Phi models, the paper shows SliceGPT can compress these models by up to 30% while maintaining over 90% of task performance. The sliced models also run faster due to reduced computation and can run on fewer GPUs.

5. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of structured pruning on very large language models without requiring extensive fine-tuning. The compute cost to slice models is just a few GPU hours.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and demonstration of SliceGPT, a new single-shot pruning method that leverages computational invariance to reduce model size and improve efficiency of large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- SliceGPT - The name of the proposed compression method to reduce parameters and computation in transformer models by deleting rows and columns of weight matrices.

- Computational invariance - The idea that orthogonal transformations can be applied to transformer weight matrices without changing the model output. This allows transforming weight matrices before deleting rows/columns.

- Principal component analysis (PCA) - Used to compute the orthogonal transformations at each layer by finding the principal components of the layer activations on a calibration set. 

- Embedding dimension - The input/output dimension of the transformer layers. SliceGPT reduces this, shrinking weight matrices and activations.

- Recovery fine-tuning (RFT) - Additional fine-tuning done after slicing to recover some of the performance lost.

- Perplexity - Generation performance metric used to evaluate language models. Lower is better.

- Zero-shot evaluation - Evaluating model performance on unseen downstream tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning.

- Structured pruning - Methods like SliceGPT that prune blocks of parameters rather than individual weights. Gives more compute/memory savings.

- Throughput - Number of tokens processed per second. Used to measure speedup from compression techniques.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the SliceGPT method proposed in this paper:

1. How exactly does the idea of "computational invariance" allow the application of orthogonal transformations to transformer weight matrices without changing the model output? Can you walk through the mathematical details?

2. The paper mentions converting LayerNorm connections to RMSNorm connections before applying slicing. Why is this conversion necessary and what is the process for absorbing the LayerNorm operations into adjacent blocks?

3. How exactly is principal component analysis (PCA) used to compute the orthogonal transformation matrices $\mQ_\ell$ at each layer? Walk through the process and explain the motivations. 

4. Explain the slicing process in detail - how do you determine which rows/columns to remove from the weight matrices after applying PCA? What is the deletion matrix $\mD$ and how does it connect to the slicing?

5. What are the tradeoffs between using a larger calibration dataset vs a longer sequence length when collecting the signals for PCA? What influenced your choices for the experiments?

6. The results show OPT models can be compressed more effectively than LLMs - what differences between these model families contribute to this? Can you analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues?

7. How does varying the slicing ratios across layers based on the eigenvalue spectrum affect performance? Why does this improve OPT but not LLM results?

8. What are the computational and memory access advantages of your structured slicing approach compared to unstructured sparsity methods? Explain in detail.

9. What opportunities exist to further improve on your method - for example combining slicing with other compression techniques? Or using different methods to calculate $\mQ$?

10. The paper mentions the idea of "computational invariance" could inspire new theoretical insights - what types of analyses, proofs, or studies do you think would be valuable to formally characterize this property?
