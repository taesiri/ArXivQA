# Encouraging Divergent Thinking in Large Language Models through   Multi-Agent Debate

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is: How can we mitigate the "Degeneration-of-Thought" (DoT) problem in large language models to enable them to generate novel thoughts through self-reflection when their initial stance may be incorrect?The key points are:- The paper identifies and defines a new issue called the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem in self-reflection for large language models (LLMs). - DoT refers to the scenario where once an LLM establishes confidence in its answers, it struggles to generate new thoughts later through self-reflection even if its initial stance was wrong.- To address DoT, the paper proposes a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework to encourage divergent thinking in LLMs. - In MAD, multiple agents express arguments in a "tit for tat" state while a judge oversees the debate to reach a solution.- Experiments on challenging datasets show MAD helps mitigate DoT and improves performance over baseline methods.So in summary, the key research question is how to address the newly defined DoT problem in LLMs to improve their ability to generate novel thoughts through self-reflection when needed. The proposed MAD framework is presented as a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes and defines the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem in self-reflection, where LLMs stick to incorrect initial answers and fail to generate novel thoughts through later self-reflection. 2. It addresses the DoT problem by proposing a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, where multiple agents debate in a "tit for tat" state to encourage divergent thinking and exploration of different reasoning chains.3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of MAD on two challenging tasks - commonsense machine translation and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning. Experiments show MAD helps weaker models like GPT-3.5 outperform stronger models like GPT-4.4. It provides extensive analysis on MAD, suggesting an adaptive break strategy and a modest level of disagreement are needed for good performance. It also finds LLMs may exhibit bias and unfairness as a debate judge when using different models for agents.5. The proposed MAD framework is shown to be an effective technique to alleviate the identified DoT problem in LLMs and improve performance on complex reasoning tasks requiring deeper contemplation. The multi-agent debate encourages divergent thinking compared to self-reflection approaches.In summary, the core contribution is identifying the DoT problem in LLMs, and addressing it by proposing a novel MAD framework that outperforms existing methods and explores different chains of reasoning through debate between multiple agents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework to address the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem in self-reflection, where agents engage in "tit for tat" debates managed by a judge to encourage divergent thinking and obtain better solutions on complex reasoning tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in the field of improving reasoning abilities of large language models:- The paper focuses on addressing the "Degeneration of Thought" (DoT) problem specifically in self-reflection methods for LLMs. This problem and analysis of how self-reflection can fail due to biases or resistance to change is a novel contribution not explored in detail in prior work. - The proposed Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework is unique in leveraging debate between multiple agents to encourage divergent thinking. Other methods like self-consistency or chain-of-thought rely on single model self-generation. Using multiple models to evaluate and correct each other is an innovative approach.- The MAD framework builds on prior work on generative agents and debates, but tailors the approach specifically to handle the identified DoT problem and complex reasoning tasks. The goals and motivations are more targeted compared to general debate agents.- The paper demonstrates strong empirical results, with MAD + GPT-3.5 outperforming GPT-4 on a machine translation task. This shows the promise of MAD as a technique to boost reasoning for existing models. - The analysis provides useful insights, like the importance of adaptive debate length and a balanced "tit-for-tat" dynamic. This helps inform design of effective debate systems.Overall, the identification of the DoT problem, proposal of MAD to address it, and thorough empirical validation on challenging tasks helps advance the understanding and techniques for improving reasoning in LLMs. The multi-agent debate approach appears to be a promising direction not fully explored in prior literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions the authors suggest:- Exploring the use of more agents in the debate framework, beyond just two debaters and a judge. The authors mention that scheduling more agents could help generate even more diverse perspectives and chain-of-thoughts. - Applying the multi-agent debate framework to other tasks beyond commonsense machine translation and arithmetic reasoning. The authors suggest board games as another potential application area that could benefit from the divergent thinking encouraged by debate between multiple agents.- Using different LLMs as the agents in the debate framework, rather than just copies of the same base LLM. The authors find that LLMs may exhibit bias towards agents implemented with the same base LLM, suggesting further exploration is needed into how to make LLMs effective and fair judges/moderators when diverse agents are involved.- Incorporating human feedback into the training of agents to improve alignment and performance, beyond just debate between LLMs. The multi-agent debate framework could potentially be enhanced by human input.Overall, the authors propose multi-agent debate as a promising approach to address inherent issues like degeneration of thought in large language models. But further research is needed to fully explore variations of the framework, evaluate different task applications, and improve the capabilities of LLMs as debaters and judges through methods like human feedback. The approach opens up many avenues for further exploration.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework to address the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem in self-reflection for large language models (LLMs). The DoT problem refers to LLMs getting stuck on incorrect solutions during self-reflection due to biases, rigid thinking, and lack of external feedback. To encourage divergent thinking, MAD involves multiple LLM agents debating in a "tit for tat" state, with a judge managing the process to reach a solution. Experiments on commonsense machine translation and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning tasks show MAD helps LLMs explore different perspectives and outperforms baselines including self-reflection. Analyses indicate adaptive debate stopping and a modest disagreement level between agents are beneficial. An interesting finding is LLMs may exhibit in-group bias as judge when different LLMs are used for debaters. Overall, MAD mitigates issues like distorted thinking and resistance to change in self-reflection and demonstrates the promise of leveraging multi-agent debate for complex reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:Paragraph 1: This paper proposes a multi-agent debate framework called MAD to address the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem in large language models (LLMs). The DoT problem refers to LLMs getting stuck on incorrect answers during self-reflection due to biases and distorted thinking. To encourage divergent thinking, the MAD framework has multiple agents debate in a "tit for tat" state managed by a judge to reach the final solution. Experiments on commonsense machine translation and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning show MAD outperforms baselines like self-reflection and chain of thought methods. Analyses suggest the adaptive debate stopping and a modest disagreement level between agents are needed for good performance.Paragraph 2: The MAD framework has agents that can correct each other's mistakes, overcome stubbornness to change, and provide external feedback. This makes MAD more resilient to the factors behind DoT compared to self-reflection. The authors find the judge favors the negative side, which helps improve performance by correcting the affirmative side's errors. Interestingly, the judge shows bias towards agents built on the same backbone LLM. Future work is suggested in using more agents, applying MAD to games, and exploring AI feedback for alignment. Overall, the proposed MAD framework demonstrates how multi-agent debate can effectively address deficiencies in solo self-reflection for complex reasoning tasks. The idea of constructive disagreement and perspective-taking holds promise for improving reasoning in LLMs.
