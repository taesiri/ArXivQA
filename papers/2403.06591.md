# [Academically intelligent LLMs are not necessarily socially intelligent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social intelligence is an important dimension of human intelligence and a milestone towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, evaluating social intelligence in large language models (LLMs) remains limited.  
- Existing benchmarks have limitations such as using contrived social contexts, focusing on only certain aspects of social intelligence, or being static datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a Situational Evaluation of Social Intelligence (SESI) benchmark grounded in an established framework of social intelligence, covering both social consciousness and social facility.
- SESI comprises 100 questions for each of 5 abilities under social consciousness and facility: empathy, social cognition, self-presentation, influence and concern. 
- The contexts and questions in SESI are derived from real requests for assistance posted on Reddit, with correct answers based on consensus of top responses. This ensures genuine, complex situations and flexible solutions.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive assessment of all core aspects of social intelligence in LLMs using SESI across 13 popular LLMs.
- Findings that social intelligence is distinct and not well correlated with academic intelligence in LLMs.  
- Identifying key error causes such as superficial friendliness patterns as reasons for poor LLM performance.
- Demonstrating LLMs cannot comprehend what social intelligence means based on varying prompt levels.
- Showing social factors like personality and perspective influence LLM social intelligence, similar to humans.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in benchmarking and evaluating the social intelligence of LLMs through the development of SESI and investigation of correlates. The findings highlight significant room for improvement in LLM social abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the social intelligence of large language models, finding their performance is still limited and distinct from academic intelligence, with superficial friendliness as a main error cause and social factors like personality and perspective influencing the social intelligence similar to humans.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a social intelligence framework with two key categories (social consciousness and social facility) to comprehensively evaluate the social intelligence of large language models (LLMs). 

2) Developing a new benchmark called Situational Evaluation of Social Intelligence (SESI) to assess LLMs' social intelligence. SESI uses real-world social scenarios from Reddit to create test questions across 5 abilities under the social intelligence framework.

3) Conducting an extensive evaluation of 13 popular LLMs on SESI which shows:
- Significant room for improvement in social intelligence of LLMs (best model gets 55.2%)  
- Social intelligence is distinct from academic intelligence for LLMs
- Main error cause is LLMs being "superficially friendly"
- LLMs can't fully understand the concept of social intelligence
- Social factors like personality and gender affect LLM social intelligence

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a way to evaluate social intelligence of LLMs using a new comprehensive benchmark grounded in a theoretical framework, and providing insights into the current state and open challenges around improving social intelligence of large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on a review of the paper content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Social intelligence
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Situational Evaluation of Social Intelligence (SESI) benchmark
- Social awareness
- Social facility  
- Empathy
- Social cognition
- Self-presentation
- Influence 
- Concern
- Academic intelligence
- Distinct construct
- Superficially friendly

- Perspective

The paper proposes a framework and benchmark (SESI) to evaluate the social intelligence of large language models. It conducts experiments showing social intelligence is distinct from academic intelligence in LLMs. The paper also examines how factors like personality, emotions, gender, social roles, and perspective impact the social intelligence exhibited by LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a social intelligence framework comprising social consciousness and social facility. Could you elaborate on why this framework was chosen over other existing social intelligence theories and how it aligns with evaluating social intelligence in LLMs? 

2. The Situational Evaluation of Social Intelligence (SESI) benchmark draws inspiration from real-world social scenarios on Reddit. What was the rationale behind using Reddit data versus other sources and what steps were taken to ensure the quality and suitability of the collected scenarios?

3. The correct answers in SESI are determined based on the consensus of top Reddit responses. Could you discuss the limitations of using consensus for ground truth and whether any additional verification was done on the selected responses? 

4. The paper analyzes common failure modes of LLMs on SESI, including being "superficially friendly." What are some hypotheses on the underlying reasons behind this behavior? Are there techniques that can mitigate this issue?

5. It was found that social intelligence exhibits low correlation with academic intelligence measures in LLMs. What are the implications of this finding for how we should evaluate progress in areas like common sense and general intelligence?

6. The paper demonstrates social factors like personality and emotion affect LLM social intelligence, similar to humans. How was the impact of these complex social variables successfully isolated and measured? 

7. What are some limitations of the semi-automated pipeline used for generating SESI questions? Could the methodology be expanded to develop even more dynamic, adaptive datasets?  

8. The 21 social roles tested provide limited coverage. What considerations determined this curated set and what plans are there to cover a more exhaustive range of occupational/interpersonal roles?

9. The implications state SESI can automatically update over time. Does this refer to potential incremental learning, or updates to the situational contexts sampled? What are long term plans for benchmark maintenance?

10. Were there any surprising or counterintuitive results uncovered over the course of analysis? What findings warrant deeper future investigation?
