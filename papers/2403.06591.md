# [Academically intelligent LLMs are not necessarily socially intelligent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social intelligence is an important dimension of human intelligence and a milestone towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, evaluating social intelligence in large language models (LLMs) remains limited.  
- Existing benchmarks have limitations such as using contrived social contexts, focusing on only certain aspects of social intelligence, or being static datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a Situational Evaluation of Social Intelligence (SESI) benchmark grounded in an established framework of social intelligence, covering both social consciousness and social facility.
- SESI comprises 100 questions for each of 5 abilities under social consciousness and facility: empathy, social cognition, self-presentation, influence and concern. 
- The contexts and questions in SESI are derived from real requests for assistance posted on Reddit, with correct answers based on consensus of top responses. This ensures genuine, complex situations and flexible solutions.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive assessment of all core aspects of social intelligence in LLMs using SESI across 13 popular LLMs.
- Findings that social intelligence is distinct and not well correlated with academic intelligence in LLMs.  
- Identifying key error causes such as superficial friendliness patterns as reasons for poor LLM performance.
- Demonstrating LLMs cannot comprehend what social intelligence means based on varying prompt levels.
- Showing social factors like personality and perspective influence LLM social intelligence, similar to humans.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in benchmarking and evaluating the social intelligence of LLMs through the development of SESI and investigation of correlates. The findings highlight significant room for improvement in LLM social abilities.
