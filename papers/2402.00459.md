# [Genetic-based Constraint Programming for Resource Constrained Job   Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Resource constrained job scheduling (RCJS) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem arising from mining supply chains that aims to schedule and sequence jobs subject to constraints like limited shared resources, precedences between jobs, etc. 
- Exact methods struggle to solve the problem optimally in reasonable times. Metaheuristics and matheuristics can find good solutions but cannot guarantee optimality and require extensive low-level customization.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a genetic programming (GP) based method to automatically design effective variable ordering heuristics to enhance the performance of constraint programming (CP) solvers for RCJS. 
- Representation: The GP individuals are variable ordering heuristics (priority functions) that guide the CP solver's search process. These priority functions are expression trees with job characteristics as terminals and arithmetic/logical operators as functions.
- Fitness: Based on the solution quality obtained by the CP solver using the priority function over training instances. Aims to find good solutions quickly rather than optimal solutions.
- Operators: Uses standard subtree crossover and mutation. Also employs a pre-selection technique to filter out poor individuals.

Main Contributions:
- Novel GP representation of variable ordering heuristics for RCJS.
- New fitness evaluation based on CP solution quality over instances rather than optimality.
- Faster identification of quality solutions compared to custom metaheuristics and matheuristics.
- Competitive performance to state-of-the-art RCJS algorithms especially for large instances, with significantly lower runtimes. 
- Simple integration with CP solvers instead of problem-specific low-level heuristics.
- Generalizable approach for enhancing CP solvers with learned variable ordering heuristics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a genetic programming algorithm to evolve efficient variable ordering heuristics for constraint programming to improve its performance in solving the resource-constrained job scheduling problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a genetic programming (GP) algorithm to evolve efficient variable selectors to improve the performance of constraint programming (CP) for solving the resource-constrained job scheduling (RCJS) problem. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A new representation of variable selectors for RCJS using expression trees with job characteristics as terminals and arithmetic/logical operators as functions. This allows evolving a wide range of priority functions for variable ordering in CP.

2) A new fitness evaluation scheme based on the solution quality obtained by CP using the variable selectors on a subset of training instances. This avoids expensive optimality proving and overfitting issues. 

3) A pre-selection technique to filter out poor variable selectors before fitness evaluation to improve efficiency. 

4) Experimental results showing that CP assisted by the evolved variable selectors can outperform default CP, existing GP methods, and specialized optimization algorithms for RCJS, especially on large problem instances.

In summary, the key novelty is developing an automated way to learn efficient variable ordering heuristics to enhance CP for solving RCJS using GP. This shows promise in improving performance over default CP and competing methods.
