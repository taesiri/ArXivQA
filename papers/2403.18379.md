# [IIP-Mixer:Intra-Inter Patch Mixing Architecture for Battery Remaining   Useful Life Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is challenging but critical for battery management systems. Existing physics-based and data-driven methods have limitations in accuracy, efficiency and generalization. Attention-based deep learning models are effective but computationally expensive. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a simple yet effective MLP architecture called "Intra-Inter Patch Mixer" (IIP-Mixer) for battery RUL prediction. Key ideas:

1) Transform input time series into patches to capture local and global temporal patterns 

2) Use parallel dual-head mixers: intra-patch MLP to capture short-term patterns within each patch and inter-patch MLP to capture long-term patterns across patches

3) Aggregate outputs from dual-head mixers and input via skip connections 

4) Introduce weighted loss function to account for different feature importance

Main Contributions:

1) Novel IIP-Mixer architecture using only MLPs to capture multi-scale temporal patterns 

2) Parallel dual-head mixer design to integrate information from both local and global views

3) First employment of weighted loss in MLP architecture for RUL prediction

4) Achieves state-of-the-art results on battery RUL forecasting with high efficiency

The experiments on real-world battery datasets demonstrate that the proposed IIP-Mixer architecture outperforms Transformer, Informer and other baseline methods in prediction accuracy and efficiency for battery RUL estimation.
