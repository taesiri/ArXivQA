# [Comparison of Waymo Rider-Only Crash Data to Human Benchmarks at 7.1   Million Miles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing the real-world safety performance of automated driving systems (ADS) is important but methodologically challenging. Prior studies comparing ADS crash rates to human benchmarks have had limitations such as biases or improper statistical comparisons.

- This paper examines the safety performance of the Waymo Driver ADS used in a rider-only ride-hailing service by analyzing its crash data reported to NHTSA and comparing to human driving benchmarks.

Methods:
- The study analyzed the first 7.14 million miles of Waymo's rider-only service across Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles using crashes reported to NHTSA's Standing General Order.

- Crashes were categorized as: all reported, in-transport vehicles only, excluding minor crashes (delta-V < 1mph), police-reported, and any injury reported.

- Waymo crash rates per million miles were compared to human driving benchmarks from literature, using valid statistical methods for rate ratios and confidence intervals. Benchmarks were selected to match geography and reporting criteria.

Results:
- The Waymo ADS had statistically significantly lower rates of police-reported crashes (57% lower) and any injury crashes (85% lower) compared to human benchmarks, when considering all locations together.

- For any property damage crashes, Waymo rates were generally lower than human benchmarks but there was greater uncertainty due to data limitations on crash reporting thresholds.

- The Waymo ADS had a 6.8 times lower any injury crash rate and 2.3 times lower police-reported crash rate compared to human drivers overall.

Conclusions: 
- The study shows the Waymo ADS operating in rider-only mode has a lower crashed vehicle rate for injury and police-reported crashes compared to human drivers over 7.14 million miles.

- This helps demonstrate safety improvements from the ADS technology. However, there are still data limitations in assessing any property damage crash performance.

- As ADS exposure increases, additional retrospective analyses will further understanding of real-world ADS safety. Benchmarking crash rates is one part of the overall safety case approach.
