# [Cannabis Seed Variant Detection using Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately identifying and detecting different cannabis seed variants is important for agriculture to enable precision breeding, ensure regulatory compliance, and improve crop quality and yield.  
- However, the ability of deep learning models to discriminate between cannabis seed varieties has not been well explored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using Faster R-CNN, a state-of-the-art deep learning object detection model, to detect and classify 17 distinct cannabis seed variants.

- They implement and evaluate 6 different Faster R-CNN models with varying training configurations:
  1) Baseline model
  2) With image augmentation and L1 loss (mL1)  
  3) With image augmentation and IoU loss (mIoU)
  4) With image augmentation and Generalized IoU loss (mGIoU) 
  5) With image augmentation and Distance IoU loss (mDIoU)
  6) With image augmentation and Complete IoU loss (mCIoU)

- The models are trained on a dataset of over 3000 high-resolution cannabis seed images categorized into 17 classes.

Key Results:
- The mL1 model achieves the best overall performance, with highest mean Average Precision (mAP) of 94.08% and F1 score of 95.66%.

- The mL1 model shows consistently higher mAP across 9 out of 17 cannabis seed classes, demonstrating its strength in localizing objects with varying spatial overlap.

- Analysis reveals a tradeoff between accuracy and inference speed. mIoU model strikes the best balance, achieving 2nd highest mAP with faster speed than top mL1 model.

Main Contributions:
- First known application of Faster R-CNN models for visually detecting and classifying cannabis seed variants
- Creation and public release of first open-access dataset of cannabis seeds with 17 categories
- Detailed analysis illuminating the performance tradeoffs between different loss functions and model architectures

In summary, the paper demonstrates that deep learning object detection models can accurately discriminate between cannabis seed types to enable precision agriculture applications. The comprehensive evaluation provides guidance for model selection based on accuracy, speed and use case constraints.
