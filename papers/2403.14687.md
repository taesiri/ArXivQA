# [On the Performance of Imputation Techniques for Missing Values on   Healthcare Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world datasets, especially healthcare data, often contain missing values which can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models. 
- There is a need to find appropriate techniques to handle these missing values and obtain optimal results from data analysis.
- There is also some debate on whether it is better to perform feature selection before imputation of missing values or vice versa when dealing with such data.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare performance of 7 missing data imputation techniques - Mean, Median, LOCF, KNN, Interpolation, MissForest, and MICE - on 3 healthcare datasets - breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease.
- Introduce 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% missing values in each dataset and use the techniques to impute the missing values. 
- Evaluate performance using RMSE and MAE error metrics. 
- Also determine if better to do feature selection before imputation or vice versa using recall, precision, f1-score, accuracy metrics.

Key Results:
- MissForest imputation performs best overall based on lowest RMSE and MAE errors, followed by MICE.
- For all 3 datasets, imputing missing values before feature selection leads to better classification performance than vice versa.

Main Contributions:
- Performance comparison of 7 imputation techniques on real healthcare datasets with introduced missing values.
- Finding that MissForest and MICE are most effective for imputing healthcare data.
- Showing empirically that it is better to impute missing values prior to feature selection for higher model accuracy.
- Providing guidance to researchers on optimal order of imputation and feature selection when analyzing healthcare datasets with missing values.

In summary, the paper examines imputation techniques for handling missing healthcare data and shows the superiority of MissForest and MICE approaches. It also demonstrates the benefits of imputing missing values before feature selection to build more accurate models.
