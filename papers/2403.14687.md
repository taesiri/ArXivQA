# [On the Performance of Imputation Techniques for Missing Values on   Healthcare Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world datasets, especially healthcare data, often contain missing values which can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models. 
- There is a need to find appropriate techniques to handle these missing values and obtain optimal results from data analysis.
- There is also some debate on whether it is better to perform feature selection before imputation of missing values or vice versa when dealing with such data.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare performance of 7 missing data imputation techniques - Mean, Median, LOCF, KNN, Interpolation, MissForest, and MICE - on 3 healthcare datasets - breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease.
- Introduce 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% missing values in each dataset and use the techniques to impute the missing values. 
- Evaluate performance using RMSE and MAE error metrics. 
- Also determine if better to do feature selection before imputation or vice versa using recall, precision, f1-score, accuracy metrics.

Key Results:
- MissForest imputation performs best overall based on lowest RMSE and MAE errors, followed by MICE.
- For all 3 datasets, imputing missing values before feature selection leads to better classification performance than vice versa.

Main Contributions:
- Performance comparison of 7 imputation techniques on real healthcare datasets with introduced missing values.
- Finding that MissForest and MICE are most effective for imputing healthcare data.
- Showing empirically that it is better to impute missing values prior to feature selection for higher model accuracy.
- Providing guidance to researchers on optimal order of imputation and feature selection when analyzing healthcare datasets with missing values.

In summary, the paper examines imputation techniques for handling missing healthcare data and shows the superiority of MissForest and MICE approaches. It also demonstrates the benefits of imputing missing values before feature selection to build more accurate models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares the performance of seven missing data imputation methods on three healthcare datasets and determines that imputing missing values before feature selection leads to better model performance than doing feature selection first.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Comparing the performance of 7 different missing data imputation methods (Mean, Median, LOCF, KNN, Interpolation, Missforest, and MICE) on 3 healthcare datasets (breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease). The performance was evaluated using RMSE and MAE error metrics.

2) Determining whether it is better to do feature selection before imputation or vice versa on the datasets. This was tested using the Missforest and MICE imputation methods along with a Random Forest classifier, and evaluating performance with recall, precision, F1 score and accuracy.

The key findings were:

- For imputation performance, Missforest performed the best followed by MICE. 

- For the order of feature selection and imputation, doing imputation before feature selection gave better classifier performance overall based on the evaluation metrics.

So in summary, the main contributions are benchmarking various imputation techniques on real-world health data, and providing guidance on whether imputation should precede feature selection.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper compares 7 different imputation techniques for handling missing values. Can you explain in detail how the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) imputation method works to fill in missing values? What are some key parameters that need to be configured when using KNN imputation?

2. The paper evaluates performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these evaluation metrics? Why might an analyst choose one metric over the other?

3. The Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) approach creates multiple imputed datasets. Why is this useful compared to single imputation methods? What are some potential downsides of using multiple imputed datasets?

4. MissForest performed the best overall in this analysis. Can you explain in detail how the MissForest algorithm works? What allows it to outperform other methods like KNN and MICE? 

5. The paper introduces missing values under a Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) assumption. How would your imputation strategy differ if values were Missing at Random (MAR) or Not Missing at Random (NMAR)?

6. For the second analysis, why do you think imputing missing values before feature selection works better than vice versa? What issues could arise from doing feature selection first?

7. The paper uses a simple classification metric (random forest accuracy) to compare selection before versus after imputation. What other more advanced model evaluation approaches could be used instead? What are the tradeoffs?

8. What other imputation methods exist beyond the 7 evaluated? Under what conditions might alternative methods like matrix factorization or GAN imputation outperform?

9. All analyses are done using python. What R packages provide similar missing data capabilities? What are relative strengths and weaknesses of using R versus Python for this analysis? 

10. The authors evaluate performance over an arbitrary range of 10-25% missing values. Over what range of missingness do you think these results would still hold? When would you expect the relative performance of methods to change?
