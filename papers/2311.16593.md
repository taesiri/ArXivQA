## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel approach for accurate COVID-19 and lung disease detection using fine-tuned deep transfer learning models. The authors evaluated several state-of-the-art models including Xception, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetB4 on two medical image datasets containing COVID-19 and lung X-ray images. After meticulous fine-tuning using global pooling, batch normalization, dropout, and dense layers, the models were optimized to enhance COVID-19 detection capabilities. Extensive experimentation, leveraging performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and error rates, revealed EfficientNetB4 with 100% COVID-19 detection accuracy and 99.17% lung disease detection accuracy as the clear superior performer. The exceptional diagnostic potential of fine-tuned EfficientNetB4 is thus demonstrated through its precise identification of both COVID-19 and lung abnormalities from X-ray images. This approach provides an automated and economical solution to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals with accurate early diagnosis, contributing significantly to global pandemic management. Its clinical utility warrants further exploration with expanded multi-modal medical imaging datasets.
