# [Boosting LLM Reasoning: Push the Limits of Few-shot Learning with   Reinforced In-Context Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with mathematical reasoning, despite efforts to optimize prompts and fine-tuning. 
- The potential of using more few-shot examples to improve reasoning has been unexplored. 
- Challenges include limited context window length restricting number of examples, and difficulty selecting helpful examples.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose CoT-Max, a novel approach to push limits of few-shot learning to improve LLM math reasoning.
- CoT-Max has a pruner module with two steps:
   1) Shot pruner selects most useful chain-of-thought (CoT) examples
   2) Token pruner removes redundant tokens from examples
- To train pruner, collected diverse math reasoning dataset (MRD^3). 
- Uses reinforcement learning to train pruner module with a tailored reward function.

Key Contributions:
- CoT-Max significantly boosts reasoning capability of various LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.
- Remarkably, LLaMA2-70B with CoT-Max surpasses GPT-3.5 and other larger models without fine-tuning.  
- MRD^3 dataset enables generalizability across wide range of math problems.
- Novel training approach addresses challenges of selecting discrete tokens and unstable training.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective approach to improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning by optimally utilizing the context window for more informative few-shot examples via a learned pruning module.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel approach called CoT-Max that pushes the limits of few-shot learning to improve language model reasoning capabilities in mathematical problem solving by using a coarse-to-fine pruner to identify and retain only the most crucial chain-of-thought examples and tokens as input context.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach called CoT-Max that pushes the boundaries of few-shot learning to improve the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) CoT-Max introduces a coarse-to-fine pruner module that identifies and removes redundant chain-of-thought (CoT) examples and tokens from lengthy few-shot inputs. This allows more informative context to be fit within the LLM's context window limit. 

2) The paper collects a diverse math reasoning dataset called MRD^3 to train and evaluate the pruner module. MRD^3 has math problems of varying difficulty levels and reasoning steps.

3) A novel training approach with reinforcement learning is used to train the pruner module, using a tailored reward function that measures both effectiveness for math reasoning and length constraints.

4) Experiments show CoT-Max boosts LLM reasoning capability significantly, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, LLaMA2-70B with CoT-Max surpasses much larger models like GPT-3.5 on mathematical reasoning.

In summary, the key innovation is the proposed CoT-Max approach that pushes the limits of few-shot learning to unlock LLM reasoning potential by identifying and retaining only the most useful CoT examples and tokens as input context.
