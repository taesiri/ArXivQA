# [DynMF: Neural Motion Factorization for Real-time Dynamic View Synthesis   with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00112)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurately and efficiently modeling dynamic 3D scenes and their motions is very challenging due to the complexity of temporal dynamics and motion. Existing methods have limitations in quickly training models, achieving real-time rendering speeds, and synthesizing high-quality novel views of complex dynamic scenes. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes DynMF, a compact and efficient neural representation that decomposes a dynamic scene into a small set of shared neural trajectories. The key ideas are:

- Represent the motion of each 3D point as a linear combination of a globally shared set of B learned trajectory basis functions modeled by a time-based MLP. This motion factorization constrains the ill-posed dynamic scene modeling problem.

- Bind this motion representation with 3D Gaussian splatting scene representation for efficient and expressive novel view synthesis. The mean and rotation of each Gaussian follows the trajectory basis functions over time.

- Apply sparsity loss on motion coefficients to disentangle motions and enable controllable synthesis of new scenes.

Main Contributions:

- Expressively models complex non-rigid deformations and scene dynamics through simple and interpretable neural motion factorization into just a few shared basis trajectories.

- Extremely efficient, enabling real-time 120FPS rendering of 1K resolution images after quick 30 minute training. Outperforms state-of-the-art in speed and quality.

- Enables disentangling of motions to independently control scene dynamics and generate novel motions. Demonstrates video editing capabilities.

- Effectively handles ill-posed monocular dynamic scene modeling without prior scene knowledge or dense correspondences. Achieves high quality results on challenging real and synthetic datasets.

In summary, the paper introduces a compact neural representation DynMF that achieves state-of-the-art real-time rendering of dynamic scenes by factorizing motions into a small set of shared neural trajectories. The motion disentanglement also enables controllable generation of new scenes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes DynMF, a neural representation that factorizes the dense motion field of a dynamic 3D scene into a set of globally shared learnable motion bases and per-point motion coefficients, enabling real-time photorealistic novel view synthesis and controllable motion decomposition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes a compact and interpretable neural representation called DynMF that can effectively model complex dynamics and motions in 3D dynamic scenes. This is done by factorizing the motion into a small set of shared neural trajectory bases that are linearly combined with motion coefficients to represent deformations and displacements of scene points over time.

2. The method is extremely efficient, allowing for very fast training (photorealistic results in less than 5 minutes, superior results in 30 minutes) and real-time rendering (over 120 FPS) of dynamic scenes. This efficiency comes from the compact trajectory basis representation and use of 3D Gaussian splatting.

3. The method can effectively constrain the ill-posed problem of reconstructing 3D dynamic scenes from monocular videos or sparse input, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. It does not require strong supervision or prior scene knowledge.

4. By enforcing sparsity on the motion coefficients, the framework can disentangle different motions in the scene, enabling controllable reconstruction and synthesis of novel motions and dynamic scenes.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient neural representation for modeling complex dynamic scenes that enables real-time rendering, accurate novel view synthesis, and controllable motion decomposition/synthesis.

7. Discuss the tradeoffs in the number of basis trajectories. What factors need to be considered when selecting this hyperparameter? How does the ablation study explore this?

8. Explain how positional encoding of the time input to the MLP trajectory basis aids in learning expressive dynamic motions. Why are high frequencies important here?

9. The method achieves compelling decomposition and disentanglement of complex motions in dynamic scenes. How could this capability be utilized in potential applications like video editing, animation, etc.?
