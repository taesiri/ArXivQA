## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of plant disease recognition datasets to facilitate research progress and real-world deployment of deep learning methods. First, it proposes an informative taxonomy to describe datasets based on application objective, input modality, image acquisition, image variation, dataset splitting, and annotation strategies. Current public RGB image datasets for plant disease recognition are then surveyed, with analysis on crop type, class numbers, image counts, backgrounds, tasks, and performance. Key future research directions are presented: creating deep learning challenge-oriented datasets that violate simplifying assumptions, collecting application-oriented datasets tailored to agricultural needs, leveraging multi-observation datasets with spatial/temporal diversity, and scaling up datasets to improve generalization. Additional insightful discussion touches on the need for public benchmarks, incorporating metadata, automatically analyzing datasets, and connecting plant disease recognition to downstream agricultural applications. Overall, this paper makes valuable contributions towards bridging the agriculture and machine learning communities to produce superior datasets and translate accuracy gains into impactful field deployment of AI techniques.
