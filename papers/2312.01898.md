# [Unlocking optimal batch size schedules using continuous-time control and   perturbation theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01898)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops a theoretical framework for deriving optimal batch size schedules in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for minimizing expected risk. It approximates the discrete SGD updates using a family of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) indexed by the learning rate. To handle the complexity arising from state-dependent noise, the SDE solution is further expanded using perturbation theory into a series with respect to the learning rate. This allows formulation of a continuous-time optimal control problem to find a quasi-optimal batch size schedule. Under reasonable assumptions, the paper shows the approximation error is quadratic in the learning rate. It applies the framework to derive an explicit optimal schedule for SGD applied to linear regression problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate significantly improved performance over constant batch sizes, especially for longer training durations. Theoretical limitations include being restricted to one dimension and requiring knowledge of population parameters. Overall, it provides an innovative optimal control perspective for tuning batch size in SGD, with ample opportunity to build upon the approach in future work.
