 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DPMesh: Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Occluded Human Mesh Recovery":

Problem:
Recovering 3D human meshes from monocular images is an important but challenging task, especially when the human is occluded by other objects or people. Existing methods rely on vanilla feature extractors like convolutional neural networks which do not perform well under severe occlusions. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising image generation capabilities, but how to effectively adapt them for complex perception tasks like occluded human mesh recovery remains an open question.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes DPMesh, a framework that exploits the rich generative priors learned by text-to-image diffusion models for occluded human mesh recovery. Unlike previous iterative diffusion-based methods, DPMesh employs a pre-trained denoising diffusion model as a backbone to extract occlusion-aware features from the input image in just a single inference step. To enhance its perception capability, spatial guidance is provided to the backbone via conditional inputs like heatmaps and 2D joint coordinates. Furthermore, a noisy keypoint reasoning approach is introduced to improve robustness against erroneous 2D observations under occlusions.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes to transfer knowledge from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to the task of occluded human mesh recovery by using the denoising model as a backbone
- Performs efficient single-step inference for mesh recovery instead of expensive iterative sampling
- Designs conditional inputs to guide the backbone for extracting informative occlusion-aware features 
- Enhances robustness to noisy 2D observations via a self-supervised keypoint reasoning approach

Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple occlusion datasets like 3DPW-OC, 3DPW-PC and 3DOH. The framework demonstrates accurate and robust mesh recovery under heavy occlusions and crowded scenes.
