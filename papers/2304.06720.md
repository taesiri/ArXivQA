# [Expressive Text-to-Image Generation with Rich Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06720)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we leverage rich text formatting options, such as font style, size, color, and footnote, to enable more precise control over text-to-image generation? Specifically, the paper proposes using a rich text editor as the interface for text-to-image generation, rather than just plain text. The key hypotheses are:- Font styles, colors, sizes, and footnotes can convey additional information beyond just the text content, like precise colors, artistic styles, object sizes, and supplementary descriptions. - Existing text-to-image models struggle to interpret this extra information from plain text prompts.- By extracting text attributes from rich text inputs, and applying region-specific diffusion processes and guidance, the extra information can be used to enable local style control, precise color rendering, token reweighting, and detailed region generation.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that rich text contains valuable formatting information that can improve text-to-image generation if properly extracted and applied through region-based diffusion. The paper aims to demonstrate this through quantitative and qualitative experiments.
