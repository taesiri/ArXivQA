# [Advancing Large Language Models to Capture Varied Speaking Styles and   Respond Properly in Spoken Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Speech is the most natural form of human communication, but existing language models (LLMs) focus mostly on text and do not effectively model speaking styles in conversational speech. 
- Modeling speaking styles is important to convey information beyond just words, properly understand human intent, and generate more natural speech responses.
- No existing datasets have speech conversations with the same sentence spoken in different styles along with corresponding responses.

Proposed Solution:
- Collect a new speech-to-speech dataset called StyleTalk with dialogue context, current speech in different styles but same words, and different corresponding response speeches.
- Propose Spoken-LLM framework to model response speech using a two-stage training approach - first align speech embeddings with LLM, then train to generate response text and style.
- Leverage emotion2vec as the speech encoder and Llama 2-Chat as the LLM backbone. 

Main Contributions:
- StyleTalk dataset with characteristic of same sentence in different styles leading to different responses, enabled by prompting GPT-4 and using expressive TTS.
- Spoken-LLM method that outperforms text-only LLM baselines in properly responding based on speaking style.
- Analysis showing style transitions patterns and impact of styles on response diversity.
- Overall advancement towards humanizing spoken conversational agents by modeling expressiveness.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in data and methods to teach LLMs to listen to and respond properly based on speaking styles in conversational speech.
