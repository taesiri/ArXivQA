# [HyenaPixel: Global Image Context with Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19305)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) typically require many stacked layers to accumulate a large receptive field and global context. In contrast, attention layers inherently support global interactions.
- Recent works have tried to replace attention with efficient alternatives like convolutions, but their application to computer vision tasks remains limited.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two extensions of Hyena, a gated convolution operator for modeling long sequences:
  1) Bidirectional Hyena (Hb): Removes causality and enables full bidirectional context.
  2) HyenaPixel (Hpx): Extends Hb to 2D feature maps to enable modeling of images.
- Hb and Hpx use extremely large convolution kernels, up to 191x191, to cover the entire input space. This approximates global context like attention, while maintaining efficiency.
- The operators are embedded into the hierarchical MetaFormer vision Transformer.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of Hb and Hpx as efficient attention approximations for images
- Achieves competitive 83.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy using only Hb convolutions
- Analysis shows Hb captures more complex patterns than Hpx with spatial bias
- Demonstrates vision Transformers can work well without positional bias when given global context
- Establishes convolutional Hb as promising new technique for global interactions in vision

In summary, the paper presents Hb and Hpx, two non-causal convolution operators that efficiently approximate global attention, and shows their strength for image classification in the MetaFormer framework, outperforming other large-kernel CNNs. The analysis provides insights into the effects of bidirectional modeling and spatial bias.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The authors extend the convolution-based attention replacement Hyena to images with extremely large kernels up to 191x191 pixels to provide global context, achieving competitive image classification accuracy, but find spatial bias slightly hurts performance compared to bidirectional modeling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's content, the main contributions are:

1) Extending the causal convolution-based Hyena operator to non-causal bidirectional sequence modeling (H$_{\text{b}}$) and to 2D images (HyenaPixel or \hypx{}) while maintaining training stability, sub-quadratic complexity, and enabling large effective receptive fields.

2) Evaluating the resulting token mixers H$_{\text{b}}$ and \hypx{} in the MetaFormer framework for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The token mixers achieve competitive results outperforming other large-kernel networks. 

3) Analyzing the learned features of \hypx{}, elaborating on the importance of global context, bidirectional modeling and spatial bias with convolution, and comparing the approach with different token mixer configurations.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating non-causal bidirectional Hyena (H$_{\text{b}}$) and 2D Hyena (HyenaPixel or \hypx{}) as efficient replacements for attention in vision transformers, while providing insights into the effect of global context, bidirectional modeling, and spatial bias.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Hyena operator - The convolutional gated operator originally proposed for sequence modeling that is extended in this work.

- HyenaPixel (\hypx{}) - The proposed 2D extension of the Hyena operator to image data. Uses large 2D convolutional kernels with spatial bias.

- Bidirectional Hyena (H$_{\text{b}}$) - The proposed non-causal, bidirectional extension of Hyena to remove the constraint of causality.

- Effective receptive field (ERF) - The region of the input image that affects a particular output, used to analyze different models.

- Global context - The goal of using very large convolutional kernels, similar to the global context provided by attention.

- Spatial bias - The bias induced by treating images as 2D spatial data rather than 1D sequences. This work analyzes the effect of spatial bias.

- Token mixing - The general term for mechanisms that integrate information across representational tokens, including attention and alternatives like Hyena.

- Vision transformers - Transformer models adapted for computer vision tasks. Used as baselines to benchmark performance.

So in summary, the key ideas are around using Hyena convolutions to provide global context for images, analyzing the effects of spatial bias, and comparing to vision transformers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes extending the Hyena operator to handle 2D images instead of just 1D sequences. What modifications were made to the original Hyena formulation to enable processing 2D inputs? How is the 2D positional encoding different?

2. The paper introduces bidirectional Hyena (Hb) that can process inputs in a non-causal manner. What changes were made to the original causal Hyena to make it bidirectional? How is the filter size and evaluation region adapted? 

3. The paper evaluates Hb and HyenaPixel in the MetaFormer framework. What are the key architectural differences between MetaFormer and other Transformer models like Swin that make it more suitable to evaluate different token mixers?

4. The paper shows HyenaPixel and Hb can match or exceed the performance of other large kernel convolutional networks on ImageNet while being more parameter efficient. What properties of the Hyena formulation enable training such large kernels effectively? 

5. The analysis shows Hb outperforms HyenaPixel, indicating spatial bias actually hurts performance. Why might the added bias be detrimental even though prior works emphasize its importance? What differences in the learned filters support this finding?

6. The paper shows an ensemble of HyenaPixel and ConvFormer leads to better accuracy than either individually. What factors might cause them to learn incompatible representations causing the ensemble to be more effective?

7. For downstream tasks requiring localization, HyenaPixel underperforms relative to convolutional baselines. What differences in the effective receptive field and visual explanations shed light on why this might occur?

8. What modifications could be made to HyenaPixel to improve localization ability while retaining its strong categorization performance? Could residual connections help balance global and local interactions?

9. The findings show global context from Hyena/Hb can largely replace fine-grained attention in the MetaFormer framework. What advantages might attention still provide over the proposed approaches in certain applications?

10. Could the ideas of extremely large kernels and non-causal modeling in Hyena be applied effectively in modalities beyond vision such as speech or video? What adaptations would need to be made?
