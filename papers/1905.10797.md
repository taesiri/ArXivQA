# [Why do These Match? Explaining the Behavior of Image Similarity Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10797)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goal is to develop a method to explain the behavior of image similarity models by identifying important attributes and image regions. Specifically, the paper introduces an approach called "Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE)" that generates explanations for image similarity models by producing a saliency map paired with an attribute that helps explain why two input images are deemed similar by the model. 

The key hypothesis is that combining saliency maps with attribute-based explanations can lead to more informative and interpretable explanations compared to using saliency maps alone. The paper validates this hypothesis through quantitative experiments showing their approach better aligns explanations with model decisions and improves user understanding in a study. Overall, the main research contributions are:

1) Providing the first study of explaining decisions made by image similarity models. 

2) Introducing a novel explanation method combining saliency maps and attributes tailored to image similarity models.

3) Demonstrating their SANE approach produces better explanations than saliency maps alone via automatic metrics and a user study.

4) Showing that using saliency maps to supervise attribute prediction not only improves explanations but also boosts attribute recognition performance.

In summary, the central research goal is developing an interpretable explanation approach specifically for image similarity models and validating that it provides more useful explanations than prior saliency-based methods. The key hypothesis is that combining saliency maps and attributes leads to better explanations for these models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper introduces a new method called Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE) to explain image similarity models. This is the first work on explaining similarity models, whereas most prior work has focused on explaining image classification models. 

2. The SANE approach combines saliency maps that highlight important image regions with attribute-based explanations that identify key properties of the images. This pairing of saliency maps and attributes provides more interpretable explanations than saliency alone.

3. The paper provides quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach using both automatic metrics and a user study. The results demonstrate that SANE explanations improve understanding of a similarity model's behavior compared to baseline explanations using random or predicted attributes. 

4. The approach is shown to generalize across two diverse datasets - Polyvore Outfits (fashion) and Animals with Attributes 2 (natural images). Qualitative examples validate that the SANE explanations pass important sanity checks.

5. An additional finding is that using saliency maps as supervision when training the attribute predictor not only improves the attribute explanations, but also boosts performance on the standard attribute recognition task.

In summary, the main contribution is a new explanation method designed specifically for image similarity models, which is comprehensively evaluated and shown to provide human-interpretable explanations that improve upon baseline approaches. The design and evaluation methodology established in this work helps advance the field of explainable AI for similarity models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a method called Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE) to explain image similarity models by identifying important attributes paired with saliency maps indicating significant image regions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on explaining image similarity models compares to other related research:

- Focus on image similarity models: Most prior work on explaining deep learning models has focused on image classification models. This paper tackles the more challenging problem of explaining similarity models, where the output depends on the relationship between two or more input images rather than just categorizing a single input.

- Saliency maps + attributes: The proposed approach combines saliency maps that identify important image regions with attribute-based explanations. Using both together provides more interpretable and useful explanations than saliency maps alone. Other methods tend to use one or the other, but not both.

- Model-agnostic: The proposed SANE approach can explain any pre-trained image similarity model, regardless of its architecture. It only relies on observing changes in similarity scores when inputs are perturbed. In contrast, some other interpretation methods are designed for specific model architectures.

- Quantitative evaluation: The paper provides extensive quantitative experiments evaluating the proposed saliency maps and attribute explanations. This includes metrics designed to test if the explanations correlate with model behavior as well as a user study. Most prior work focuses on qualitative results. 

- Improves standard tasks: An interesting finding is that using saliency maps to supervise attribute learning improves attribute recognition performance. So the explanations help provide insight into the model while also boosting its standard accuracy.

- Generalizes across domains: The method is evaluated on two diverse datasets - fashion outfits and animal images. The consistency of results across domains helps demonstrate the generalization of the approach.

In summary, this paper makes both methodological and empirical contributions to the nascent field of explaining image similarity models. The model-agnostic approach combined with quantitative evaluation of explanations sets it apart from much of the closely related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- More closely integrating the saliency map generator and attribute explanation model components of their approach. The authors mention that enabling each component to take advantage of the predictions of the other could help improve overall performance.

- Evaluating the approach on more complex tasks and datasets. The paper focuses on image similarity, but the authors suggest the method could potentially be applied to other tasks like visual question answering where both the question and image would need to be considered. Evaluating on more complex datasets could reveal limitations.

- Exploring different ways to discover or obtain attribute explanations automatically when human annotations are not available. The authors provide some initial ideas using saliency-based clustering, but suggest more work is needed in this area.

- Extending the approach to use multiple attributes jointly to explain a model's predictions, rather than just a single top attribute. The current approach ranks and selects the top attribute, but using multiple complementary attributes could provide a richer explanation.

- Integrating textual or natural language explanations in addition to visual saliency maps and attribute explanations. The authors suggest their attribute explanations could help generate textual explanations for model behavior.

- Evaluating the approach on additional modalities beyond images, such as on multi-modal tasks that involve both images and text.

- Developing more rigorous methods to evaluate the quality of explanations and their usefulness to human users. The authors use both automatic metrics and a human study, but suggest additional work is needed in developing standardized evaluation procedures.

In summary, the main directions seem to be improving the individual components of the approach, extending it to more complex tasks and data, integrating textual explanations, using multiple attributes jointly, and developing better evaluation methods for explanations. Overall the authors position this work as an initial approach for explaining image similarity models that can serve as a foundation for much future research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE) to explain the predictions of image similarity models. Image similarity models take two or more images as input and output a score indicating how similar they are, unlike image classification models which take a single image and predict a class label. Explaining these models is challenging since changing one of the input images can change which features are considered salient. The SANE method combines three components - an attribute predictor, a saliency map generator, and an attribute explanation suitability prior. The attribute predictor identifies attributes present in an image and also produces an activation map indicating important regions for each attribute. These activation maps are encouraged to match saliency maps produced by the generator which highlight image regions important for the similarity score. At test time, attributes are ranked by how well their activation map matches the similarity saliency map, the likelihood the attribute is present, and a learned prior on how useful each attribute is for explaining similarity decisions. The method is evaluated on fashion (Polyvore Outfits) and natural image (Animals with Attributes 2) datasets. Both automatic metrics and a user study demonstrate SANE's ability to produce useful explanations consisting of both attributes and saliency maps. The approach also improves standard attribute recognition performance when using saliency maps as supervision.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a method called Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE) to explain image similarity models, where the model outputs a score measuring the similarity of two input images rather than a classification label. Existing explanation methods designed for image classification models do not apply directly, as they produce a saliency map highlighting important pixels in a single input image. Image similarity models require two images as input, so the interaction between them determines which features are most important. The paper introduces an approach to generate both a saliency map and an attribute explanation identifying key image properties for a pair of input images. Their SANE approach combines an attribute classifier, an attribute explanation suitability prior learned over the similarity embedding, and a saliency map generator adapted from prior work. During training, SANE encourages overlap between the similarity saliency map and attribute activation maps. At test time, attributes are ranked as explanations based on matching with the saliency map, the likelihood the attribute exists in the image, and the attribute explanation prior. Experiments on fashion (Polyvore Outfits) and animal (Animals with Attributes 2) datasets demonstrate SANE's ability to generalize across domains. A user study validates that the approach produces sensible, human-interpretable explanations that improve understanding of an image similarity model's behavior over baseline methods.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) Providing the first quantitative study of explaining image similarity models where decisions depend on relationships between two inputs; 2) Introducing a novel explanation approach combining saliency maps and attribute explanations; 3) Validating the method's ability to produce useful explanations through automatic metrics linked to model performance and a human user study; 4) Demonstrating the discovered attribute explanations can further improve standard attribute recognition.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE), a method to explain image similarity models by identifying important attributes paired with saliency maps indicating significant image regions. The approach consists of three components: an attribute predictor to produce confidence scores and activation maps for attributes in an image, a saliency map generator to identify important image regions for a match, and an attribute explanation suitability prior. During training, the attribute activation maps are encouraged to match the saliency maps. At test time, attributes are ranked as explanations by a weighted combination of the attribute-saliency map matching score, the attribute likelihood, and the attribute explanation suitability prior. The method allows explaining any pretrained image similarity model in a “black box” manner without needing model access or gradients. SANE combines saliency maps that lack interpretability with human-understandable attributes to produce more informative explanations than either alone.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of explaining image similarity models. Specifically, it notes that most prior work has focused on explaining image classification models, which make predictions about a single input image. However, image similarity models make predictions based on the relationship between two or more input images. So the authors propose a new method, called Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE), to explain the behavior of image similarity models by identifying important attributes and image regions.

The key questions the paper seems to be addressing are:

- How can we extend explanation methods designed for image classification models to work for image similarity models?

- What kinds of explanations, in terms of important attributes and image regions, are most useful for understanding the behavior of image similarity models?

- How can identifying salient attributes and image regions not only explain a model's predictions but also improve the model's performance on tasks like attribute recognition?

So in summary, the paper is introducing a new approach to generate explanations specifically tailored for image similarity models, as opposed to just adapting image classification explanation techniques. The proposed SANE method identifies important attributes and saliency maps to explain model predictions.
