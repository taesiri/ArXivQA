# [Reasoning in Transformers -- Mitigating Spurious Correlations and   Reasoning Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11314)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transformer models like BERT have shown promise for reasoning tasks, but can learn "shortcuts" - spurious correlations in the data that allow guessing the right answer without logical reasoning. 
- Prior work by Zhang et al. showed a BERT classifier exploits correlations between number of rules/facts and query truth values rather than learning to reason.
- It's unclear if transformers can be trained to do robust reasoning while avoiding such shortcuts.

Methods:
- Use the SimpleLogic dataset of reasoning problems with known spurious correlations (between rules/facts and truth). 
- Extend dataset with full proofs to provide more supervision.
- Train two models: 
   - WP-BART: generative transformer producing whole proofs
   - SIP-BART: neuro-symbolic model generating proof steps, combined with symbolic checker
- Evaluate on accuracy of query truth value and consistency of proof steps.

Results: 
- SIP-BART avoids shortcuts and achieves 99.9% accuracy, unlike BERT and WP-BART. Proof steps help model reason properly.
- Analysis reveals 4 new types of subtle errors SIP-BART makes, like generating non-existent rules or prematurely ending proofs.

Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates that step-by-step reasoning supervision helps transformers avoid spurious correlations/shortcuts.
- SIP-BART architecture combines strengths of neural and symbolic methods for improved reasoning.
- Identifies and categorizes 4 new reasoning errors transformers can make, suggests mitigation strategies.
- Provides insights into remaining challenges for achieving robust reasoning in neural models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates how training neural network models to generate step-by-step proofs helps mitigate reliance on spurious correlations and improves logical reasoning ability, finding that a neuro-symbolic model iteratively producing and checking single proof steps avoids statistical shortcuts most effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides empirical evidence that training transformers to generate proofs step-by-step helps them better approximate logical reasoning and avoid learning spurious correlations in the data. This builds on prior work showing that step-wise reasoning improves transformer performance on reasoning tasks.

2) It introduces a neuro-symbolic architecture called SIP-BART that combines a transformer model for selecting inference steps with a symbolic system for tracking the proof state. This model is shown to avoid spurious correlations in the data even better than transformers trained on full proofs.

3) It identifies and analyzes four additional types of reasoning errors made by the transformer models, even when trained on step-wise proofs. These include using synonyms, locality bias, and prematurely concluding the proof. Potential mitigation strategies are suggested for these errors.

4) It creates an augmented benchmark dataset called SimpleLogicPS that extends an existing propositional logic benchmark with machine-generated proof steps. This can enable more in-depth analysis of reasoning approximations in models.

In summary, the key contribution is providing both empirical evidence and analysis explaining why step-wise reasoning helps transformers approximate logical deductions, through experiments using both standard and neuro-symbolic transformers.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Transformers - The neural network architecture used in models like BART and BERT. The paper investigates reasoning capabilities of transformers.

- Reasoning - Approximating logical reasoning is one of the key goals examined in the paper. In particular propositional logic reasoning. 

- Spurious correlations - The paper investigates if transformers learn actual reasoning patterns or rely on shortcuts based on spurious statistical correlations in the data.

- Neuro-symbolic models - The SIP-BART model combines a neural module with a symbolic system to better approximate reasoning and avoid spurious correlations. 

- Proof steps - Training the models to produce proof steps sequentially rather than just a final true/false label is a key aspect explored.

- Consistency - The paper analyzes the soundness and completeness of the proof steps generated.

- SimpleLogic dataset - The propositional logic reasoning problems dataset used in the experiments.

- BART/BERT - The transformer models fine-tuned and analyzed.

So in summary, key concepts are transformers, reasoning, spurious correlations, neuro-symbolic architectures, proof steps, consistency, and the SimpleLogic dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper trains two models - WP-BART which is trained to generate whole proofs, and SIP-BART which generates proofs step-by-step. Why does SIP-BART perform better at avoiding spurious correlations in the data? What specifically about the step-by-step training helps mitigate this?

2. The SIP-BART model combines a neural module with a symbolic module. What is the purpose of each module and how do they interact during inference? What strengths does this neuro-symbolic architecture provide?

3. Four types of consistency errors made by SIP-BART are identified - non-existing rules, inapplicable rules, spurious matches and unexhausted search space. Can you describe each error type? What underlying causes lead to these errors? 

4. Three mitigation strategies are suggested - dealing with synonyms, dealing with locality bias, and dealing with search space issues. Explain each strategy in detail and how it would address the identified error types.

5. The paper analyzes two potential reasoning shortcuts - correlations between number of rules/facts and truth values, and increased proof depth correlating to more false queries. How exactly could these features allow "guessing" the truth without logical reasoning?

6. What specifically about the step-by-step training methodology restricts the neural model's access to global statistical patterns, and how does this force better approximation of deductive reasoning?

7. The locality of training data is noted as an important factor. Explain what is meant by locality in this context and how proof-step training increases locality.

8. Could the identified error types potentially propagate through more complex logical reasoning if the model was scaled up? How might this affect reliability and trustworthiness?

9. The model still makes some errors even with step-by-step training - what implications does this have for how we should view and use neuro-symbolic systems for reasoning? What role should the symbolic module play?

10. If you were to extend this work, what specific forms of more complex reasoning would you test the SIP-BART model on to further analyze its capabilities? What potential issues may arise as complexity increases?
