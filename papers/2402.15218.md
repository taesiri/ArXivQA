# [BSPA: Exploring Black-box Stealthy Prompt Attacks against Image   Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image generators can be vulnerable to exploitation by adversaries to generate harmful/NSFW content. 
- Prior work has limitations in crafting stealthy prompts that can bypass filters and feasibly simulate real attacks. Manual design of prompts is labor-intensive and lacks diversity. Direct use of LLMs struggles to ensure threat level and diversity.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Black-box Stealthy Prompt Attack (BSPA) method to automatically generate diverse, stealthy and malicious prompts. 
- It uses a retriever to match sensitive words to input text. Pseudo-labeling and loss functions enhance prompt relevance and diversity. It transforms zeroth-order to gradient-based optimization.

Key Contributions:
- BSPA framework to effectively simulate attacks from API users by creating stealthy, offensive and diverse malicious prompts.
- NSFWeval benchmark with 3000 prompts that expose vulnerabilities in APIs like Stable Diffusion XL, Midjourney and DALL-E.
- A resilient text filter that can suppress 84.9% of prompt attacks to improve safety.
- A security verification framework for generative models to evaluate and address their vulnerabilities against misuse.

In summary, the paper introduces an automated and effective framework for evaluating vulnerabilities in image generators against stealthy prompt attacks. The benchmark and analysis provide valuable insights to advance more secure and ethical image generation technologies.
