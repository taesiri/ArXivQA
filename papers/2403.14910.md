# [Defying Imbalanced Forgetting in Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14910)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The paper reveals a phenomenon called "imbalanced forgetting" in class incremental learning (CIL), where the accuracy between classes of the same old task becomes highly imbalanced due to catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. 
- This issue has not been identified previously as most CIL methods rely on average incremental accuracy as the evaluation metric which assumes uniform accuracy within each task.

- The paper shows through analysis that imbalanced forgetting stems from varying semantic similarity between old and new classes, where representation conflicts cause more forgetting for similar classes.

Proposed Solution:
- A framework called CLAss-Aware Disentanglement (CLAD) is proposed to tackle imbalanced forgetting. It has two components:
   - Forgetting Prediction (FP): Identifies vulnerable old classes likely to suffer more forgetting when learning a new class, based on semantic similarity.
   - Representation Disentanglement (RD): Encourages new class representations to stay away from representations of predicted vulnerable old classes.

- CLAD is formulated as a regularization term that can be readily integrated into existing CIL methods.

Main Contributions:
- Reveals the issue of imbalanced forgetting between classes in CIL for the first time.
- Establishes connection between inter-class similarity and imbalanced forgetting through analysis. 
- Proposes CLAD framework to identify and mitigate representation conflicts between vulnerable old and new classes.
- Shows consistent improvements by CLAD over state-of-the-art CIL methods on various benchmarks.
- Provides a new perspective to stimulate further research on class-level analysis in CIL.
