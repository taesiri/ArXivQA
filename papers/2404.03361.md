# [nicolay-r at SemEval-2024 Task 3: Using Flan-T5 for Reasoning Emotion   Cause in Conversations with Chain-of-Thought on Emotion States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03361)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on the problem of emotion cause analysis in conversations, specifically identifying which utterance causes a particular emotion in another utterance in the conversation context. This is part of SemEval-2024 Task 3.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a two-stage training methodology to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to solve this problem. 

- In Stage 1, they use a "Chain-of-Thought" (CoT) approach called THoR to preliminarily tune the LLM to predict emotion states of utterances. 

- In Stage 2, they adapt THoR for identifying emotion causes between utterance pairs. They also propose a "reasoning revision" technique to leverage predicted emotion states from Stage 1 to better determine caused emotions.

- Their overall methodology is called THoR_cause-rr and uses prompting to guide the LLM through multiple reasoning hops to reach the final prediction.

Main Contributions:

- Adaptation of the THoR framework for emotion cause analysis in conversations and proposal of a two-stage training methodology.

- Introduction of a reasoning revision technique to integrate predicted emotion states into determining caused emotions between utterances. 

- Experiments showing improved performance from applying THoR versus prompt-based tuning, and the reasoning revision enhancement.

- Analysis of predicted emotion causes showing similarity in correlations between speaker states and caused emotions to the training data annotations.

- The methodology and framework implementation have been open-sourced to support further research.
