# [HuBERT: Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning by Masked   Prediction of Hidden Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question addressed in this paper is:How can we learn high quality speech representations in a self-supervised manner, without relying on large volumes of labeled data or text-only material?The key challenges outlined are:1) Speech signals contain multiple sound units in each input utterance, unlike images which contain a single object instance. 2) There is no lexicon of input sound units available during pre-training, unlike in NLP where word or word piece vocabularies exist.3) Sound units have variable lengths and no explicit segmentation boundaries.To address these challenges, the authors propose a self-supervised model called Hidden Unit BERT (HuBERT) that utilizes an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like masked prediction loss. The key hypothesis seems to be that this approach can learn effective speech representations by forcing the model to predict properties of masked regions based on unmasked context.In summary, the central research question is how to develop an effective self-supervised learning method for speech that does not rely on labeled data or text resources. The proposed HuBERT model aims to address this by using clustered units and masked prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing HuBERT, a self-supervised speech representation learning approach. Key points:- HuBERT relies on predicting k-means cluster assignments of masked segments of continuous speech input, similar to masked language modeling in BERT. This forces the model to learn acoustic and language representations from raw speech.- HuBERT deals with challenges in self-supervised speech representation learning: multiple sound units per utterance, no lexicon during pretraining, variable length units.- Iterative refinement of cluster assignments using latent representations from previous iterations dramatically improves representation quality.- HuBERT matches or exceeds state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 results on Librispeech and Libri-light benchmarks over various low-resource fine-tuning setups.- Scales well to 1B params, reducing WER by up to 13% relative to smaller models.In summary, the key contribution is presenting HuBERT, a novel and effective self-supervised approach for speech representation learning, which leverages masked prediction and iterative refinement of k-means clustering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes HuBERT, a self-supervised speech representation learning approach that relies on predicting k-means cluster assignments of masked segments from continuous speech inputs, and shows it matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on Librispeech and Libri-light benchmarks when fine-tuned on subsets ranging from 10 mins to 960 hours.
