# [Dual-Teacher De-biasing Distillation Framework for Multi-domain Fake   News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-domain fake news detection aims to identify fake news across different topics/domains. However, existing methods suffer from domain bias due to the imbalanced distribution of real/fake news across domains in datasets.  
- This leads to models discriminating news from different domains, e.g. more likely to classify disaster news as fake and finance news as real.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Dual-Teacher De-biasing Distillation (DTDBD) framework with two teachers - an unbiased teacher and a clean teacher.

- The unbiased teacher uses an improved domain adversarial training method to learn domain-invariant features and transfer this as knowledge to the student model. This helps reduce domain bias.

- The clean teacher leverages state-of-the-art multi-domain fake news detection models as teachers to transfer their effective domain knowledge to the student. This maintains detection performance.

- A momentum-based dynamic adjustment algorithm balances the effects of the two teachers on the student model.

Main Contributions:
- Novel dual-teacher distillation framework to mitigate domain bias in multi-domain fake news detection while maintaining performance.

- Adversarial de-biasing distillation method using an unbiased teacher to transfer knowledge of domain-invariant features.

- Domain knowledge distillation method using a clean teacher to transfer knowledge of effective domain representations.

- Momentum-based dynamic adjustment algorithm to balance the two distillation objectives.

- Extensive experiments on Chinese & English datasets show state-of-the-art performance in reducing domain bias while maintaining competitive detection accuracy.
