# [KDMCSE: Knowledge Distillation Multimodal Sentence Embeddings with   Adaptive Angular margin Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for learning multimodal sentence embeddings using contrastive learning take random negative samples from the batch without reviewing when forming contrastive pairs. This results in many suspicious and noisy negative examples that significantly affect the methods' performance. 
- Current contrastive learning objectives do not consider the distinctions between negative sample pairs and simply treat them the same. However, negative pairs can have varying degrees of similarity which needs to be modeled.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel framework called KDMCSE that utilizes CLIP as a teacher model to transfer knowledge from both visual and textual modalities via contrastive learning. This enhances discrimination of representations and ability to detect noisy negative samples.
- Introduce a new contrastive learning objective called AdapACSE that captures varying semantics within negative pairs by strengthening the margin within the angular space in an adaptive way based on similarity scores predicted by the teacher model.

Main Contributions:
- Novel multimodal framework KDMCSE that transfers knowledge from CLIP teacher model spanning both text and visual data to improve sentence embeddings.
- New adaptive angular margin contrastive learning technique AdapACSE that accounts for diversity in negative pairs by flexibly finding the margin based on teacher model's soft labels.
- Evaluations on semantic textual similarity tasks and transfer learning benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed KDMCSE method.

In summary, the paper proposes a teacher-student contrastive learning framework to learn better multimodal sentence embeddings, along with an adaptive margin objective to handle varying semantics in negative pairs. Evaluations demonstrate effectiveness.
