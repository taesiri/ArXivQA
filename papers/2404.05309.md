# [CLIPping the Limits: Finding the Sweet Spot for Relevant Images in   Automated Driving Systems Perception Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Perception systems like cameras are critical for automated driving systems (ADS). Testing them thoroughly is important to ensure robustness and reliability. 
- To test perception systems, relevant test image data sets need to be compiled. However, it is challenging to find specific, relevant images within large data sets.
- Methods like CLIP can search images based on textual queries by mapping images and texts to a common latent space. However, CLIP only provides a similarity-sorted list without indicating the threshold of relevant images.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a method to automatically determine a relevance threshold in the CLIP-sorted list to extract the most relevant images for a textual query. 
- They model the distribution of image-text similarity scores as a sum of two gaussians (relevant and irrelevant images) or a single gaussian distribution. By fitting these models, a threshold can be derived.
- A fallback procedure based on outliers of a single gaussian is used when the two-gaussian model does not fit well.

Contributions:
- The key contribution is the automated determination of a relevance threshold for CLIP-based image search that balances false positives and false negatives.  
- This reduces manual effort in extracting relevant image sets, helping accelerate ADS testing and development.
- The method is robust with a fallback solution and tested on a automotive image dataset with weather variations.
- Precision and recall comparable to optimal F1 score threshold is demonstrated, while extracting subsets with 10-25% of total dataset.

In summary, the paper presents a way to leverage CLIP-based searching to automatically create targeted test data sets for ADS perception systems by finding a relevance threshold.
