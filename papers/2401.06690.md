# [Embedded Planogram Compliance Control System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Planogram compliance control is crucial in retail stores to maintain proper product placement and stock levels. Manual checking is labor-intensive and error-prone. Existing automated solutions can be expensive, intrusive or impractical. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a complete embedded system for automated planogram compliance control with four key components:
  1) Image acquisition and transfer module using ESP-EYE camera
  2) Object detection module using YOLOv5 on single board computers (SBCs)  
  3) Planogram compliance control module using a modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm on SBCs
  4) Energy harvesting and power management module using solar and RF harvesting

- The ESP-EYE camera captures and transfers shelf images when changes are detected. The SBCs run object detection using YOLOv5 and planogram compliance checking using sequence alignment. Energy harvesting extends system battery life.

- Object detection is done in two steps - YOLOv5 generates bounding boxes, then a local feature matching step filters object candidates. Compliance checking aligns the detected and reference planograms using a modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

- An iterative, focused search technique is used to improve detection by relaxing constraints and focusing on undetected regions.

Main Contributions:

- Complete embedded system architecture for automated retail planogram compliance control addressing cost, power and space constraints

- Use of YOLOv5 for object detection outperforming prior methods

- Modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for planogram alignment and compliance checking  

- Analysis of multiple SBCs demonstrating system scalability and hardware flexibility

- Solar and RF energy harvesting framework to enable long-term stand-alone operation  

- Experimental validation indicates high accuracy (F1 Score = 1) and efficiency of the proposed system

In summary, the paper presents a practical embedded vision system leveraging innovations in object detection, sequence alignment and energy harvesting to effectively automate the planogram compliance control process in retail environments.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a complete embedded system for planogram compliance control in retail stores. The key aspects of the system are:

1) An image acquisition and transfer block using ESP-EYE camera modules to capture shelf images and transmit them when changes are detected. This block operates in a stand-alone manner using a battery supplemented by solar and RF energy harvesting.

2) Object detection on single board computers using YOLO models, replacing the previous ISM method. This brings improved object detection performance.

3) Planogram compliance control using a modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for sequence alignment and comparison. An iterative search method is also used to improve compliance checking. 

4) Analysis of different hardware configurations like Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson boards to demonstrate the system's flexibility in meeting diverse performance and cost constraints.

5) Experimental validation on public datasets that shows the proposed system achieves higher object detection and planogram compliance performance compared to prior baseline methods.

In summary, the key contribution is a complete embedded vision system tailored for retail planogram control that is stand-alone, flexible, cost-effective and demonstrates improved accuracy.
