# [Visual Semantic Navigation with Real Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16623)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents ROS4VSN, a novel Robot Operating System (ROS) based framework for easily integrating and testing state-of-the-art visual semantic navigation (VSN) models on real robots. The authors embed two cutting-edge VSN methods, PIRLNav and VLV, into two distinct robotic platforms after making necessary technical adaptations. An extensive experimental evaluation is conducted, where the robots equipped with VSN models autonomously navigate in real-world environments targeting different object categories. The results demonstrate a considerable performance gap between simulation and the real world - the success rate of PIRLNav dropped from 65% to 21% while VLV dropped 10 percentage points. The VLV model, which uses a modular learning approach and incorporates an object detector, outperforms the end-to-end trained PIRLNav in real-world tests. This contrasts the simulation results where PIRLNav previously achieved much higher success. The study confirms that modular learning VSN methods can generalize better to real-world settings. By open-sourcing ROS4VSN, this research enables easy prototyping and validation of VSN techniques on physical robots, tackling the simulation-to-reality gap in embodied AI and advancing visual semantic navigation research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The authors present a ROS-based framework called ROS4VSN for easily testing and comparing visual semantic navigation models on real robots, integrate two state-of-the-art models into real platforms, and find that their performance is significantly lower in the real world compared to virtual environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The development of ROS4VSN, a novel ROS-based framework for visual semantic navigation that allows easy testing and comparison of different VSN models on real robots. ROS4VSN is model-agnostic, allowing integration of any VSN solution.

2) The integration of two state-of-the-art VSN models, PIRLNav and VLV, into two real robotic platforms using the ROS4VSN framework. This required technical adaptations to the models to allow them to work with real-world observations rather than simulated environments.  

3) A detailed experimental evaluation analyzing the performance of these VSN models on real robots, showing a significant drop in success rate compared to virtual environments. The experiments also demonstrated the stability of the system by having the robots autonomously navigate over 5km.

4) An analysis showing modular-learning VSN models like VLV perform better than end-to-end approaches like PIRLNav when deployed on real robots.

In summary, the main contribution is the development of the ROS4VSN software framework to facilitate testing and advancement of visual semantic navigation systems on real-world robotic platforms.

The paper proposes a ROS-based framework called ROS4VSN for testing and comparing visual semantic navigation models on real robots. It integrates two state-of-the-art VSN models, PIRLNav and VLV, into real robotic platforms using this framework. The key aspects analyzed are the performance difference of VSN models between simulation and the real world, and the comparison between modular learning (VLV) and end-to-end learning approaches (PIRLNav).
