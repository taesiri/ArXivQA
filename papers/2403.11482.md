# [SeisFusion: Constrained Diffusion Model with Input Guidance for 3D   Seismic Data Interpolation and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Seismic data often has missing traces due to geographic, physical or economic constraints. Reconstructing complete seismic data is an important step in seismic data processing.
- Traditional methods rely on manual parameter tuning and struggle with large-scale continuous missing data. Convolutional neural networks also have limitations in capturing the full data distribution.
- Existing diffusion models are unconditional generative models designed for 2D image generation, unsuitable for 3D seismic data reconstruction tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose SeisFusion, a 3D constrained diffusion model with input guidance for seismic data reconstruction. 
- Introduces conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model to constrain the generated outputs based on the input data.
- Employs a 3D UNet architecture with attention and time embedding as the backbone network to extend diffusion model from 2D to 3D.
- Incorporates missing data directly into the generation process via guided sampling, enhancing result consistency.

Main Contributions:
- Incorporates constraints into diffusion model for the first time to enable application to seismic reconstruction tasks.
- Extends diffusion model from 2D to 3D using a tailored 3D backbone network architecture.
- Achieves superior performance in reconstructing complex missing patterns in seismic data compared to previous methods.
- Learns actual data distribution unlike CNNs, avoiding performance degradation on complex missing data.
- Implementation publicly available to facilitate further research.

In summary, the paper successfully adapts the diffusion model for 3D seismic data reconstruction via constrained generation and guided sampling, outperforming previous approaches on complex missing patterns while avoiding their limitations.
