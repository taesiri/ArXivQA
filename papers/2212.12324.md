# [Shakes on a Plane: Unsupervised Depth Estimation from Unstabilized   Photography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12324)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The key research questions and contributions of this paper are:

1. Is it possible to estimate high-quality object depth and camera motion directly from a long-burst image stack captured with natural hand tremor on a mobile device?

2. Can this be done in an end-to-end unsupervised manner without requiring pose initialization or depth supervision? 

3. Can a neural RGB-D model be fit to long-burst data to jointly distill depth and pose through photometric consistency, rather than relying on separate feature extraction and matching steps?

The central hypothesis is that the small parallax motion from hand tremor in a long (2 second) burst contains enough multi-view information to recover geometrically accurate scene depth, if modeled appropriately. 

To test this, the authors propose an end-to-end approach to simultaneously estimate object depth and camera motion by fitting a continuous neural scene representation to the long-burst data. Their key contributions are:

1) A neural RGB-D model with implicit image and depth networks, trained via photometric consistency to long-burst frames.

2) A depth-on-a-plane decomposition to model foreground objects and background regions without parallax cues. 

3) Demonstrating state-of-the-art depth maps from only a single long-burst capture, validated on complex geometries.

In summary, they show high-quality depth reconstruction is possible from long-burst data alone, in an end-to-end framework requiring no hardware beyond a standard mobile camera.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing an unsupervised end-to-end approach to jointly estimate high-quality object depth and camera motion from unstabilized long-burst photography using only RAW image frames and gyroscope data. The key points are:

- They propose an end-to-end neural RGB-D scene fitting approach that distills depth and camera pose estimates directly from long-burst data by minimizing photometric loss through explicit 3D projection. This avoids the need for separate feature extraction, matching, and pose estimation steps.

- They introduce a depth-on-a-plane decomposition, with a learned planar component representing the background and an implicit MLP offset representing foreground object depth. This helps avoid spurious depth solutions. 

- They leverage the multiresolution hash encoding to perform coarse-to-fine reconstruction, first estimating smooth depth variations before refining details.

- They demonstrate high quality depth reconstruction on real data that outperforms existing learned, multi-view, and mixed methods. Comparisons to structured light scans validate the accuracy of reconstructed geometries.

- Their approach requires only a long-burst image stack and gyroscope data, with no need for specialized hardware, ground truth poses, or depth initialization. It can operate even without RAW or gyroscope data.

In summary, they show that an end-to-end trained neural volumetric scene representation can recover accurate object depth and camera motion from micro-baseline long-burst photography captured on commodity mobile devices.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised neural approach to jointly estimate high-quality object depth and camera motion from RAW long-burst image sequences captured on a smartphone, demonstrating improved performance over existing learned and multi-view depth estimation methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an unsupervised end-to-end approach for estimating high-quality object depth and camera motion from unstabilized long-burst mobile photography. Here are some key ways it compares to other research:

- It diverges from previous small motion works like Yu et al. and Im et al. that rely on feature extraction and matching or additional hardware. Instead, it proposes a single differentiable model trained end-to-end to distill depth from fitting to long-burst data.

- Compared to other multi-view stereo methods like BARF and DfUSMC that also estimate depth and motion directly from image stacks, this method outperforms them quantitatively and qualitatively on tests.

- Unlike recent neural radiance approaches that require pre-processed camera poses, this jointly estimates relative depth and pose with no pose initialization. It is most similar to Chugunov et al.'s approach but doesn't require a depth sensor or pose estimates.

- It demonstrates higher fidelity object reconstruction than state-of-the-art monocular methods like MiDaS by leveraging parallax from long-burst data. Comparisons to structured light scans validate the geometric accuracy.

- The depth on a plane decomposition produces better segmentations than learned priors and helps avoid artifacts in textureless regions that challenge other multi-view methods.

- It shows robustness to various input settings, gracefully handling RGB vs RAW input and gyroscope data removal. This demonstrates the flexibility of the approach.

In summary, this work pushes the boundary of what can be accomplished with readily available mobile photography data. By training an end-to-end model on long-burst captures, it achieves compelling depth reconstruction without specialized hardware or separate pose estimation steps. The comparisons validate it as a state-of-the-art approach in this setting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest some future research directions at the end of the paper:

\textbf{Forward Models:} Their static single-plane RGB-D representation could be extended to include differentiable models of object motion, deformation, or occlusion. 

\textbf{Image Refinement:} They currently use the learned image $I(u,v)$ to optimize depth, but it may be possible to instead use the learned depth $D(u,v)$ to refine the image (e.g. for denoising or deblurring).

\textbf{From Pixels to Features:} Low-texture or distant regions lack parallax cues for their ray-based depth estimation. Learned local feature embeddings could help aggregate spatial information in these areas.

The key suggestions are to extend the RGB-D representation to handle more complex scene dynamics, explore using the depth to refine the image instead of vice versa, and incorporate learned features to help with depth estimation in challenging areas like distant or textureless regions. The overall theme is enhancing the neural RGB-D model to handle more complex real-world imaging conditions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an unsupervised end-to-end approach to jointly estimate high-quality object depth and camera motion directly from unstabilized two-second captures of 12-megapixel RAW frames and gyroscope data acquired during long-burst photography. The authors formulate the problem as an image synthesis task, decomposed into explicit geometric projection through continuous depth and pose models inspired by recent neural radiance field approaches. In contrast to these methods, camera poses are jointly distilled with depth estimates by fitting the model to long-burst data and minimizing photometric loss. The depth model uses a planar decomposition to avoid spurious solutions in low-parallax regions. Evaluations demonstrate the approach outperforms existing single and multi-frame depth estimation methods, with comparisons to high-precision structured light scans validating accuracy of reconstructed geometries. The method requires only a long-burst capture to produce high-fidelity affine depth and pose estimates, with no additional hardware, stabilization, or pre-processing steps.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper proposes an unsupervised end-to-end approach to jointly estimate high-quality object depth and camera motion from unstabilized two-second captures of 12-megapixel RAW frames and gyroscope data. The method formulates the problem as an image synthesis task, similar to neural radiance methods, with explicit geometric projection through continuous depth and pose models. During test time, the neural RGB-D model is fit directly to long-burst data and simultaneously distills relative depth and pose estimates by minimizing photometric loss. The depth model uses a plane plus offset decomposition, with a learned planar component representing the background and an offset component capturing object depth. The camera motion model uses a low-parameter Bézier curve to model the smooth, continuous motion from natural hand tremor. The model is trained end-to-end, using a coarse-to-fine approach by controlling which volume features the network has access to during training. Experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing single and multi-frame depth estimation methods. Comparisons to high-precision structured light scans validate the accuracy of the reconstructed object geometries. The depth-on-a-plane decomposition also facilitates background masking, segmentation, and image compositing applications.

Overall, this paper makes the key contribution of showing that with a suitable neural RGB-D model and geometric projection constraints, high-quality and geometrically accurate depth estimates can be obtained solely from long-burst photography captures exhibiting natural hand tremor motion. The unified end-to-end approach distills both depth and camera motion in a single model, avoiding separate data processing and pose estimation steps. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on depth estimation from long-burst data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an unsupervised end-to-end method to jointly estimate high-quality object depth and camera motion from a stack of images captured during long-burst photography on a smartphone. The key ideas are:

- Formulate the problem as an image synthesis task, where a neural RGB-D representation is fit to the long-burst image stack to minimize photometric loss. 

- The RGB-D representation consists of an implicit image and an implicit depth model with a learned planar offset. This decomposes the scene into a background plane and foreground objects with parallax-derived depth offsets.

- Camera motion is modeled with continuous rotation initialized from device gyroscope data plus a learned translation spline. 

- The projection of points from the implicit RGB-D model to the image stack is fully differentiable. So the entire model including image, depth, and motion components is trained end-to-end by minimizing photometric loss through gradient descent.

- A coarse-to-fine training procedure reconstructs low-resolution depth first before refining details, by masking levels of the positional encoding given to the depth network.

- The plane plus offset depth decomposition allows segmentation of objects from the background using negligible depth offsets as a mask.

In summary, the key contribution is a single end-to-end trainable model that jointly estimates high-quality continuous depth and camera motion from RAW smartphone images and gyroscope data, without any separate pose estimation or depth initialization steps.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of estimating high-quality object depth from unstabilized (handheld) photography using mobile phone cameras. Specifically, it looks at estimating depth from "long-burst" image sequences, which are 2-second captures containing around 40 frames. 

The key questions the paper aims to address are:

1) Can millimeter-scale motion from natural hand tremor in long-burst captures provide enough parallax information to recover accurate object depth, despite the very small baselines? 

2) Can this be done in an unsupervised end-to-end manner using a neural scene representation, without needing specialized hardware like depth sensors or pre-processing steps like pose estimation?

The paper proposes a method to jointly estimate object depth and camera motion from long-burst RAW image data and gyroscope measurements, using an end-to-end differentiable model based on a neural representation of the scene. It shows this approach can outperform existing learned and multi-view stereo depth estimation techniques that operate on single or multi-frame data.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of leveraging tiny baseline parallax cues that are usually ignored, in order to reconstruct high-quality depth maps directly from a single long-burst capture taken with a standard mobile phone camera. It does this with an end-to-end model requiring no pose initialization or specialized hardware beyond a gyroscope.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Long-burst photography - Capturing a continuous sequence of images over several seconds from a handheld camera. This creates small view variations from natural hand tremor that can be leveraged for 3D reconstruction.

- Unsupervised depth estimation - Estimating scene depth in an unsupervised manner directly from image data, without ground truth depth supervision.

- Micro-baselines - The small (millimeter-scale) motion baselines created from natural hand tremor in long-burst photography.

- Implicit neural representations - Using deep neural networks like MLPs to represent 3D properties like color and depth as continuous implicit functions. 

- Photometric consistency - The assumption that color/brightness of points should stay constant across views. Violations of this can be used as a loss to optimize depth and pose.

- Coarse-to-fine reconstruction - Gradually increasing the resolution/complexity of the reconstructed depth representation during training for more robust optimization.

- Depth-on-a-plane decomposition - Modeling scene depth as a planar background plus a learned foreground depth offset. This helps separate object and background depths.

- End-to-end optimization - Jointly training all model components like image encoding, depth network, and pose model together rather than separate disjoint steps.

- Device motion data - Using onboard phone sensors like gyroscopes to provide auxiliary rotation motion data to aid camera pose estimation.

The core ideas are using long-burst image data and implicit neural representations to distill high quality depth and motion in an unsupervised end-to-end manner. The depth-on-a-plane decomposition also seems useful.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents an unsupervised end-to-end method for jointly estimating high-quality object depth and camera motion from long-burst photography. The authors leverage the small amounts of parallax created by natural hand tremor during two-second mobile captures to perform multi-view stereo depth reconstruction, without the need for active depth hardware or ground truth pose information. Their approach uses a neural scene representation, modeling each input frame as a deformation of a reference image projected through a continuous depth map with changing camera pose. The depth model itself is composed of a planar component representing the scene background, and a learned offset capturing object parallax. Through optimizing photometric consistency between the projected model outputs and input frames via gradient descent, both the scene depth and relative camera poses are refined. Compared to existing learned and multi-view methods on a range of real and synthetic scenes, this approach produces complete high-fidelity depth maps which accurately reconstruct object geometry. An additional benefit is the ability to leverage the planar depth component for foreground object segmentation and compositing onto new backgrounds. By combining implicit neural representations with an explicit geometric projection model, the proposed method effectively distills metric depth from challenging unstructured burst photography.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an unsupervised method for high-quality depth estimation from long-burst photography. The authors capture a two-second burst of RAW images from a handheld phone camera, producing small view variations from natural hand tremor. They formulate depth estimation as an image synthesis task, with a neural scene representation comprising an implicit RGB image and depth map projected through estimated camera poses. The depth uses a planar plus offset model to distinguish low-parallax background regions from foreground objects with multiview cues. This representation is trained end-to-end by minimizing photometric loss between rendered and real image frames. Without ground truth depth or poses, the method jointly estimates both as part of directly fitting the model to data. Evaluated on real and synthetic scenes, it outperforms previous multi-view and learning-based depth estimation techniques in accuracy and geometric consistency. The estimated plane plus offset depth enables background segmentation for editing and compositing applications.
