# [Scheduling Drone and Mobile Charger via Hybrid-Action Deep Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10761)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers a scenario with a drone that needs to fly through and observe multiple points of interest (PoIs) to gather data. However, drones have limited battery life, typically lasting only tens of minutes. To enable longer drone operations, the paper proposes using a mobile charger (e.g., a charging vehicle) that can move to designated charging points and wirelessly recharge the drone when it lands. The key challenge is to find an optimal schedule for the drone's flights and observations at PoIs, as well as the mobile charger's movements and charging times, in order to maximize the drone's data gathering utility within the shortest timeframe without running out of battery. This scheduling problem involves hybrid (discrete and continuous) actions for both the drone and charger and requires them to cooperate, posing challenges for existing reinforcement learning methods.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a hybrid-action deep reinforcement learning framework called HaDMC to address this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce a representation learning approach to convert the hybrid action space into a continuous latent space, allowing a standard policy learning algorithm (TD3) to be used.  

2) Design an "action decoder" module with two separate pipelines to translate the latent continuous actions into the original discrete and continuous actions that the drone/charger can execute.

3) Incorporate a mutual learning scheme between the two pipelines during training to learn coordinated actions for the drone and charger.  

4) Tailor the reward function to incentivize efficient observation utility and cooperation.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to address drone-charger scheduling problem with hybrid actions using deep reinforcement learning
- Novel action decoder design and mutual learning scheme to handle hybrid actions and encourage cooperation 
- Extensive experiments showing HaDMC outperforms baselines in observation efficiency and task completion time

The core concept of representing hybrid actions in a continuous latent space and decoding to original actions could provide useful insights for other multi-agent problems involving hybrid actions.
