# [InteraRec: Interactive Recommendations Using Multimodal Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00822)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional recommendation systems rely heavily on mining user weblogs, which requires extensive data engineering to extract useful features. This poses challenges for interpretation, especially for non-experts. 
- Weblogs also do not allow for real-time, concurrent recommendations as they reflect past user behavior.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes \rec{}, an interactive recommendation framework that uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze screenshots captured in real-time as users browse a website. 
- High frequency screenshots are input to a MLLM which summarizes user behavior and preferences based on predefined categories (e.g. price range, color preferences).
- The summary is input to a function-calling capable LLM that decomposes it into constraints and objectives to formulate an optimization problem. The LLM executes optimization scripts to generate recommendations.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces a novel framework, \rec{}, that generates recommendations in real-time based on screenshot analysis using MLLMs rather than reliance on historical weblogs.
- Demonstrates interpreting user behavior by summarizing screenshots using MLLMs across predefined preference categories. 
- Shows integrating optimization tools with LLM capabilities by transforming image-based behavioral summaries into mathematical formulations.
- Overcomes limitations of weblog-based systems through visually-grounded mechanism enabling real-time personalized recommendations.

In summary, the key innovation is using MLLMs and screenshots to understand user preferences combined with leveraging LLM abilities to connect the summaries with optimization tools for delivering dynamic recommendations.
