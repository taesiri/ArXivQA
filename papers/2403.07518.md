# [Open-Vocabulary Scene Text Recognition via Pseudo-Image Labeling and   Margin Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07518)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of open-vocabulary scene text recognition, where the goal is to recognize both in-vocabulary (IV) words seen during training as well as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words not seen before. Most prior works focus on recognizing IV words based on language models and dictionaries, but perform poorly on recognizing OOV words due to the lack of training data. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework called Pseudo-OCR that contains three main parts:

1) Pseudo label generation module: Uses a character detector and image inpainting to decompose real images into characters and backgrounds. Then generates pseudo OOV labels by randomly removing, adding or swapping characters. A semantic checking is used to filter meaningless pseudo labels. 

2) Text recognition network: Employs a Transformer-based encoder-decoder network to recognize text from images.

3) Quality-aware margin loss: Introduces a margin loss to enhance discrimination and a quality indicator based on detection confidence to identify and penalize low-quality samples.

Main Contributions:

1) A pseudo label generation method that creates more realistic OOV training data by leveraging real image components.

2) A semantic checking technique to reduce noises in the generated pseudo labels. 

3) A tailored margin loss for text recognition that handles low-quality training samples.

4) State-of-the-art performance on 8 datasets for both IV and OOV scene text recognition. The method secured 1st place in ICDAR2022 competition.

In summary, the key innovation is generating high-quality pseudo labels from real images to better recognize OOV words, along with a customized loss function. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed Pseudo-OCR framework.
