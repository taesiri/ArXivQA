# [External Knowledge Augmented Polyphone Disambiguation Using Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11920)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Polyphone disambiguation in Mandarin Chinese text-to-speech (TTS) systems is challenging when doing grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, as some Chinese characters have multiple pronunciations depending on context.  
- Existing methods lack sufficient supervised data and struggle to leverage deep semantic features.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate polyphone disambiguation as a text generation task using large language models (LLMs) augmented with external knowledge. 
- A multi-level semantic dictionary is constructed from the Internet as external knowledge to provide definitions, part-of-speech tags, phrases for each pronunciation candidate.
- The solution has 3 modules - Retrieval, Generation, and Postprocess:
  - Retrieval module converts input sentence into a natural language prompt incorporating dictionary info.
  - Generation module uses a decoder-only Transformer to output target pinyin sequence.
  - Postprocess handles invalid predictions by choosing closest valid candidate.

Main Contributions:
- First work to apply LLM techniques to polyphone disambiguation.
- Utilizes multi-level dictionary to improve performance and handle unseen characters.
- Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on public CPP dataset by 0.21% accuracy.
- Maintains strong performance across varying training set sizes.
- Qualitative evaluation shows the model can correctly disambiguate unseen polyphones using only the dictionary.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel LLM-based polyphone disambiguation approach for TTS that leverages external semantic knowledge to achieve new state-of-the-art results while also demonstrating better generalization capabilities.
