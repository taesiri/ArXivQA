# [Lifelong Intelligence Beyond the Edge using Hyperdimensional Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing machine learning techniques face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained IoT edge devices that need to continually learn and adapt to changing environments without supervision. Specifically, neural networks have high computational and memory demands. Most lifelong learning techniques rely on some form of supervision, replay buffers, or task boundaries, which are often unavailable in real-world edge deployments. There is a need for lightweight, unsupervised lifelong learning techniques suitable for edge devices.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LifeHD, the first end-to-end system for on-device unsupervised lifelong learning using Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). HDC is a bio-inspired computing paradigm that represents data using high-dimensional, low-precision distributed vectors called hypervectors. Computation is performed using simple element-wise operations on these hypervectors.

LifeHD has a two-tier memory architecture - a working memory to store temporary prototypes (cluster hypervectors) and a long-term memory to consolidate prominent prototypes. It processes streaming data via novelty detection, prototype update, and prototype merging modules. Novelty detection identifies new patterns. Non-novel patterns update existing prototypes. A spectral clustering-based algorithm merges similar prototypes to reduce memory and reveal relationships. Infrequent prototypes are forgotten.

The authors also propose SemiLifeHD to utilize scarce labels and EffiLifeHD for adaptive model pruning to reduce power.

Contributions:

1) Design and deployment of LifeHD - the first system for on-device, unsupervised, streaming lifelong learning using lightweight HDC.

2) A two-tier memory architecture and collaborative learning modules for optimal performance.

3) SemiLifeHD extension to harness limited labels. EffiLifeHD extension for adaptive pruning.

4) Improves accuracy over neural network baselines by up to 11.8% and energy efficiency by up to 34.3x on 3 real-world datasets deployed on edge devices. Approaches supervised HDC accuracy without any labels.
