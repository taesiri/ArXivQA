# [Optimal-Landmark-Guided Image Blending for Face Morphing Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Face morphing attacks pose a threat to face recognition systems (FRSs) by creating a morphed face image that matches multiple identities. 
- Existing morphing methods have limitations:
  - Landmark-based methods produce poor visual quality due to facial distortions and artifacts.
  - Generation-based methods fail to preserve identity information.

Proposed Solution:
- An optimal-landmark-guided image blending approach to generate high quality and realistic morphed faces that can effectively attack FRSs.

Key Points:
- A landmark blending module to generate optimized morphed landmarks that preserve facial structures of contributing subjects. Uses losses to enforce similarity to original landmarks.
- A landmark guided image blending module that uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model spatial relationships between landmarks and guide appearance feature modification.
- Landmarks represented as nodes in a fully connected bipartite graph. GCNs used to capture cross-long-range relationships. 
- Appearance features updated based on attention maps from GCN to enable smooth face warping.
- Adversarial training with landmark and appearance discriminators.

Main Contributions:
- Novel landmark blending to obtain better morphed landmarks.
- GCN-based guidance of appearance features during image warping.
- Achieves higher visual quality and better identity preservation compared to prior arts.  
- Generated morphed faces pose more threat to FRSs than previous methods.

In summary, the paper proposes an approach to generate realistic and high quality morphed faces that can attack state-of-the-art face recognition systems by blending optimized landmarks and using GCN-guided appearance feature updating.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new face morphing attack method that uses optimal-landmark-guided image blending with graph convolutional networks to generate high visual quality morphs that can evade face recognition systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new morphing attack method against face recognition systems (FRSs) that generates high-quality morphed images with both good visual quality and a high attack success rate. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) An optimal landmark blending module that adaptively generates morphed landmarks to better maintain the facial geometry of contributing subjects. 

2) A landmark guided image blending module that uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract morphing features from the morphed and contributing landmarks and aggregates them with appearance features to generate morphed images.

3) Qualitative and quantitative experiments showing the proposed method achieves better identity preservation, visual quality, and higher attack success rates against FRSs compared to state-of-the-art morphing attack methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a new morphing attack method that balances visual quality and attack success rate through optimal landmark blending and GCN-based image blending guidance. The experiments demonstrate the proposed method's improved performance over existing techniques.
