# [Deep Learning-based Image and Video Inpainting: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03395)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning based image and video inpainting methods. Inpainting refers to filling in missing or corrupted parts of images/videos with semantically plausible and visually realistic content. 

The paper first reviews deep learning based deterministic and stochastic image inpainting methods. Deterministic methods output a single completed result, while stochastic methods can generate multiple varied results. Key technical aspects are discussed, including single-shot models, two-stage coarse-to-refine models, progressive reconstruction, mask-aware convolutions, attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature fusion, losses like pixel reconstruction, perceptual, style, and adversarial losses etc. Applications like object removal, text editing, photo restoration, compression, and text-guided editing are described. 

For video inpainting, the paper categorizes methods into 3D CNN based, shift-based, flow-guided, and attention based. 3D CNNs extend image inpainting models. Shift-based methods propagate information temporally in a computationally cheaper way. Flow-guided approaches complete the optical flow first and then propagate pixels. Attention based methods model long range dependencies. Different losses, datasets and metrics are analyzed. Example applications include blind video decaptioning and dynamic object removal.  

The paper also proposes future research directions like leveraging large scale pre-trained generative models such as diffusion models, using text-guided inpainting with text-image models like CLIP for controllable synthesis, creating and training models on massive (5 billion scale) image and video datasets, and transferring learning from image to video inpainting.

In summary, this paper provides a very broad, detailed and up-to-date review of deep learning based image and video inpainting research, highlighting key technical concepts, losses, models, datasets, evaluation metrics and real world applications, as well as suggesting promising future work.
