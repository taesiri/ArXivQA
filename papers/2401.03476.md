# [Freetalker: Controllable Speech and Text-Driven Gesture Generation Based   on Diffusion Models for Enhanced Speaker Naturalness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing works on co-speech gesture generation focus on global style control and do not facilitate free movement of the speaker, such as walking around the stage. These motions are important in presentations/speeches.
- There has not been an effort that coherently integrates the generation of both spontaneous (e.g. co-speech gestures) and non-spontaneous (e.g. moving around the podium) speaker motions. Challenges arise from varied motion representations and multimodal learning intricacies.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a diffusion-based model for speaker motion generation, trained on heterogeneous data sourced from various motion datasets.
- Employ classifier-free guidance during inference for highly controllable style in the generated clips.
- Adopt DoubleTake to create smooth transitions between clips and ensure seamless motion blending.

Main Contributions:
- Propose FreeTalker, the first framework to the authors' knowledge for generating both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speaker motions trained on multiple datasets.
- Incorporate classifier-free guidance and DoubleTake in the diffusion-based model for enhanced flexibility and control in gesture generation.  
- Demonstrate improved naturalness in generated speaker motions through experiments, surpassing existing approaches in terms of motion quality.

The key ideas are using a diffusion model trained on diverse motion datasets, leveraging classifier-free guidance and DoubleTake for better control and transitions, and showing through both quantitative metrics and user studies that the framework generates more natural motions than prior works.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and conclusion sections, the main contribution of this paper is:

Proposing FreeTalker, the first framework to the authors' knowledge for generating both spontaneous (e.g. co-speech gesture) and non-spontaneous (e.g. moving around the podium) speaker motions trained on multiple datasets. Specifically, the key aspects are:

(1) Integrating heterogeneous motion data from various datasets into a unified framework for generating both types of motions. 

(2) Incorporating classifier-free guidance and DoubleTake method in the diffusion-based model to ensure enhanced flexibility and control over the generated gestures and motions.

(3) Demonstrating through experiments that the framework can generate natural and controllable speaker motions that surpass existing approaches in terms of motion quality.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel framework called FreeTalker that can generate high-quality and controllable spontaneous and non-spontaneous motions for virtual speakers/avatars by effectively combining heterogeneous training data and leveraging diffusion models, classifier-free guidance, and the DoubleTake method.
