# [HIP Network: Historical Information Passing Network for Extrapolation   Reasoning on Temporal Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12074)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) contain facts that evolve over time. Reasoning on TKGs to predict missing facts is an important problem. 
- Existing methods assume complete timestamped graphs are available during training, making it hard to predict future events with unknown timestamps. 
- Extrapolation reasoning aims to predict emerging facts over future unknown timestamps based on historical data. This is challenging as temporal patterns behind events are complex.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Historical Information Passing (HIP) network with three components:
   1) Structural information passing (SIP) module: Captures interactions between co-occurring events using a disentangled graph neural network.
   2) Temporal information passing (TIP) module: Models evolution patterns of events between entities using RNN and self-attention.
   3) History forward (HF) module: Predicts plausibility of events from repetitive, structural and temporal perspectives using three scoring functions.
- HIP network passes selective historical information and models temporal changes in both entities and relations.
- A multi-step reasoning algorithm is used with the three scoring functions to sequentially predict future graphs.

Main Contributions:
- Novel end-to-end learning framework for extrapolation reasoning on TKGs which models temporal, structural and repetitive patterns.
- Explicitly models dynamic evolution of relations using RNN and self-attention.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets, with significant gains in Hits@1 highlighting the method's accuracy in predicting future events.
