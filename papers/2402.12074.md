# [HIP Network: Historical Information Passing Network for Extrapolation   Reasoning on Temporal Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12074)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) contain facts that evolve over time. Reasoning on TKGs to predict missing facts is an important problem. 
- Existing methods assume complete timestamped graphs are available during training, making it hard to predict future events with unknown timestamps. 
- Extrapolation reasoning aims to predict emerging facts over future unknown timestamps based on historical data. This is challenging as temporal patterns behind events are complex.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Historical Information Passing (HIP) network with three components:
   1) Structural information passing (SIP) module: Captures interactions between co-occurring events using a disentangled graph neural network.
   2) Temporal information passing (TIP) module: Models evolution patterns of events between entities using RNN and self-attention.
   3) History forward (HF) module: Predicts plausibility of events from repetitive, structural and temporal perspectives using three scoring functions.
- HIP network passes selective historical information and models temporal changes in both entities and relations.
- A multi-step reasoning algorithm is used with the three scoring functions to sequentially predict future graphs.

Main Contributions:
- Novel end-to-end learning framework for extrapolation reasoning on TKGs which models temporal, structural and repetitive patterns.
- Explicitly models dynamic evolution of relations using RNN and self-attention.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets, with significant gains in Hits@1 highlighting the method's accuracy in predicting future events.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Historical Information Passing (HIP) network to predict future events in temporal knowledge graphs by modeling temporal evolution patterns, structural interactions, and historical repetition of events.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called HIP network for extrapolation reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). Specifically:

1) The HIP network passes historical information from three perspectives - temporal, structural and repetitive - to model the evolution patterns, neighborhood interactions, and repetition of events respectively. 

2) It considers the updating of both entity and relation representations in the information passing process.

3) It proposes a multi-step reasoning algorithm with three scoring functions to evaluate events from the above three perspectives and generate predictions sequentially.

4) Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art performance of the HIP network, especially significant improvements on Hits@1 metric, indicating its effectiveness in accurately predicting future events.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an end-to-end framework that selectively incorporates historical information and performs temporal reasoning from multiple views to address the challenging problem of extrapolation on TKGs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Historical Information Passing (HIP) network. What are the key components of this network architecture and how do they enable modeling temporal evolution patterns in knowledge graphs?

2. The HIP network contains structural and temporal information passing modules. How do these modules update entity and relation representations over time? What mechanisms allow capturing dynamic neighborhood interactions and evolution of events between entity pairs?  

3. What is the purpose of using disentangled graph convolution in the structural information passing module? How does it help selectively aggregate neighborhood information and update relevant parts of entity/relation embeddings?

4. Explain the temporal self-attention mechanism used in the temporal information passing module. How does it integrate entity representations across different time steps? Why is a masking approach used?

5. How does the paper model evolution of relations between entity pairs over time? What is the motivation behind using a GRU architecture for this modeling?

6. What are the three scoring functions proposed for evaluating plausibility of events in the History Forward module? How do they assess events from temporal, structural and repetitive perspectives?

7. Explain the multi-step reasoning algorithm used during test time inference. What is the purpose of generating candidate entity pairs and quadruples at each step? 

8. Why does the paper argue that modeling evolution patterns, neighborhood interactions, and repetition of events provides useful inductive biases for temporal knowledge graph reasoning? Provide examples.

9. The results show significant gains on Hits@1 metric over state-of-the-art methods. Why does this indicate that the proposed approach is better at predicting exactly what events will occur?

10. What empirical analysis is conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of different components like disentangled graph convolution, temporal self-attention, and scoring functions? How does it illustrate their roles?
