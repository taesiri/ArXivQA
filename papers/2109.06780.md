# [Benchmarking the Spectrum of Agent Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06780)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is:

How can we develop an efficient benchmark environment that evaluates a wide spectrum of general agent capabilities within a single environment?

The key goals and hypotheses appear to be:

- Crafter can pose substantial challenges in generalization, exploration, reusable skills, credit assignment, memory, representation learning, and survival to current RL methods.

- Evaluating agents based on their success rates at achieving semantically meaningful "achievements" can offer insights into the ability spectrum of both reward-driven and unsupervised/intrinsic motivation agents.

- Crafter can evaluate a variety of abilities in a single environment, reducing the compute requirements compared to benchmark suites that require separate training on many environments.

- Current RL algorithms will find Crafter challenging but not unsolvable, making it a good difficulty level to drive further research progress.

So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that Crafter can serve as an efficient and informative benchmark for researching and evaluating general agent capabilities across a spectrum of important skills. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the environment design, proposed evaluation protocol, baseline experiments, and analysis of emergent agent behaviors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is introducing Crafter, a new benchmark environment for evaluating a wide spectrum of agent abilities within a single environment. The key aspects highlighted are:

- Crafter is an open world survival game with visual inputs that requires agents to forage, craft tools, build structures, etc. 

- It procedurally generates a new world for each episode, requiring generalization.

- Agent abilities are evaluated through unlocking "achievements" during episodes, covering a range of difficulties.

- Experiments show current RL methods can make progress but have room for improvement, while the environment is still solvable by human experts.

In summary, the paper introduces Crafter as a new challenging but achievable environment that can efficiently evaluate progress on a variety of agent capabilities within a single task, rather than requiring training many separate tasks. The aim is to accelerate research by providing a benchmark that drives progress on core challenges like generalization, exploration, credit assignment, and long-term reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- The paper introduces Crafter, a new benchmark environment for evaluating reinforcement learning agents. Crafter aims to test a wide range of abilities within a single environment through procedurally generated worlds and a set of semantically meaningful achievements. This is in contrast to many existing benchmark suites like Atari or ProcGen which require training agents separately on multiple different environments. The unified environment approach of Crafter could enable more efficient experimentation.

- The paper provides baseline results from standard RL algorithms like PPO, Rainbow, and DreamerV2. The performance is far below human expert play, suggesting Crafter poses open challenges for future research. However, the paper lacks comparisons to other recently proposed challenging benchmarks like NetHack or MineRL. Direct comparisons on the same algorithms would better situate Crafter's difficulty.

- A key feature of Crafter is the set of 22 achievements that aim to measure diverse skills. This is more explicit and interpretable than just a raw score. However, a downside is the achievements may constrain agent behaviors. Other benchmarks like MineRL take a more open-ended approach by simply measuring how many items an agent collects.

- For unsupervised/intrinsic motivation RL, the paper shows some basic algorithms like RND can unlock several achievements. But there is a lack of comparison to more sophisticated algorithms tailored for exploration like Go-Explore. Comparisons could better demonstrate the challenges in Crafter's exploration component.

- The human expert dataset provides an estimate of human performance. But the data is limited to only 100 episodes from 5 players. More data from a wider pool of players could help better situate human performance and agent capabilities. 

Overall, Crafter makes interesting contributions as a new unified benchmark for RL research. But more in-depth comparisons to existing methods and benchmarks could better demonstrate its advantages and situate its challenges. The paper provides a solid starting point but leaves ample room for future work to further analyze Crafter's design and difficulty.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to solve the remaining challenges posed by the Crafter benchmark, such as achieving deep exploration of the technology tree, strong generalization across procedurally generated maps, long-term credit assignment, and learning reusable skills. The authors note there is still substantial room for progress on Crafter.

- Extending Crafter by adding new enemies, resources, items, and achievements once current challenges are solved. This could prevent the benchmark from becoming obsolete. The Python codebase facilitates such extensions. 

- Grouping the achievements in Crafter into more abstract categories like "memory", "generalization", and "exploration". This could allow for higher-level evaluation of agent abilities.

- Using Crafter to study hierarchical reinforcement learning, since progress requires repeating and combining skills.

- Leveraging Crafter to research representation learning, by predicting environment states from image observations.

- Taking advantage of the human demonstrations dataset provided with Crafter for imitation learning research.

- Comparing different unsupervised objectives and self-play approaches for making progress without extrinsic rewards.

- Developing new metrics beyond the current score to capture breadth vs depth of exploration.

- Studying emergence of complex skills like building structures within Crafter's simple world.

In summary, the authors suggest many promising research directions to further exploit Crafter's design for general agent intelligence, including solving its current challenges, extending its scope, applying it to study particular AI capabilities, and analyzing the behaviors that arise from playing it.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Crafter, a new benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning agents. Crafter is an open world survival game with procedurally generated 2D worlds featuring forests, mountains, caves, and lakes. Agents control a player that needs to collect resources, craft tools, find food and water, and defend against monsters. The key aspects of Crafter are: 1) It evaluates a diverse range of abilities like exploration, credit assignment, memory, and representation learning using a single environment and 22 semantically meaningful achievements. 2) Worlds are procedurally generated so agents must generalize instead of memorizing. 3) It offers a challenging but solvable environment to drive future RL research. Experiments show current RL algorithms achieve scores around 5%, compared to 50% for human experts, demonstrating room for progress. The code, human dataset, and baselines are available to facilitate research. Overall, Crafter accelerates RL research by quickly evaluating a spectrum of agent capabilities within a single environment.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Crafter, a new benchmark environment for evaluating general agent abilities in reinforcement learning. Crafter is an open world survival game with procedurally generated 2D worlds containing forests, mountains, caves, and lakes. The agent controls a player that must collect resources, craft tools, find food and water, and defend against monsters. The key contribution is that Crafter poses a wide range of challenges like exploration, credit assignment, memory, and representation learning within a single environment. Agents are evaluated based on their ability to unlock "achievements" during episodes, such as collecting resources or crafting tools. The achievements correspond to meaningful milestones in capability. Crafter provides a sparse reward signal that agents can optionally use, along with two benchmark protocols - one with rewards and one without for unsupervised learning. Experiments show current algorithms still lack behind human performance, leaving room for advances. Example agent behaviors include building bridges and tunnels, defending areas, and setting up resource production. In summary, Crafter accelerates research by evaluating many abilities in one environment and establishes baselines scores for future work.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is introducing a new benchmark environment called Crafter for evaluating reinforcement learning agents. The key problems/questions it aims to address are:

- Current RL benchmarks like Atari or ProcGen test narrow abilities on separate environments. This requires expensive training on many environments. Crafter evaluates a wide range of abilities within a single environment to accelerate research.

- Existing benchmarks lack dense, meaningful rewards and evaluation metrics. Crafter provides a set of semantically meaningful "achievements" that agents should aim to unlock, along with a scoring metric based on achievement success rates.

- Environments like Minecraft are too complex for current RL methods. Crafter distills the core mechanics of Minecraft into a simpler, faster environment of appropriate difficulty.

- General capabilities like exploration, memory, credit assignment, and representation learning remain key open challenges in RL. Crafter is designed to evaluate progress on these challenges through procedural generation, sparse rewards, partial observability, etc.
