# [An Emulator for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models using Small Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12962)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

What capabilities arise from independently scaling pre-training versus fine-tuning of language models?

The authors introduce a method called "emulated fine-tuning" (EFT) which allows them to combine the knowledge learned during pre-training of a model at one scale, with the knowledge learned during fine-tuning of a model at a different scale. 

Using EFT, they can directly study the impact of scaling up or down either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages. The main hypothesis appears to be that scaling up pre-training will lead to improved factuality, while scaling up fine-tuning will lead to improved task performance and helpfulness.

In summary, the central research question is: how do capabilities change when scaling pre-training versus fine-tuning independently? And the key hypothesis is that pre-training scale impacts factuality while fine-tuning scale impacts helpfulness/task performance. The paper introduces EFT to test this hypothesis through controlled experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a technique called "emulated fine-tuning" (EFT). EFT provides a way to decouple the scale of pre-training from the scale of fine-tuning in large language models. 

Specifically, EFT enables:

- Directly studying the capabilities that emerge from scaling up pre-training vs fine-tuning independently. Experiments using EFT provide evidence that scaling up pre-training improves factuality, while scaling up fine-tuning improves helpfulness.

- Approximating fine-tuning a large model using a small fine-tuned model and large pre-trained model, without actually having to fine-tune the large model. This is called "up-scaling" and can be practically useful when fine-tuning a small model is feasible but a large one is not. 

- Modifying the fine-tuning objective at test time without additional training, such as adjusting the tradeoff between helpfulness and harmlessness.

The key idea behind EFT is to factor a fine-tuned model's logits into a) base log probabilities from the pre-trained model and b) a "behavior delta" capturing the changes from fine-tuning. By substituting different scale base models and behavior deltas, the result of pre-training and fine-tuning at different scales can be emulated.

Overall, EFT provides a principled way to study and make use of the different knowledge gained in pre-training vs fine-tuning language models. The techniques enable new analyses and applications around scaling these different stages.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces a method called emulated fine-tuning (EFT) that allows decoupling the scale of pre-training and fine-tuning of language models. The key idea is to represent a fine-tuned model as a pre-trained base model reweighted by the ratio of the fine-tuned and base model probabilities. This allows combining a large pre-trained base model with adjustments learned from fine-tuning a small model, enabling study of their separate effects and approximating fine-tuning a large model without doing the expensive computation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of language model training:

This paper introduces a novel technique called "emulated fine-tuning" (EFT) for decoupling the scale of pre-training from the scale of fine-tuning in large language models. The key idea is to decompose a fine-tuned model into a pre-trained base model and a "behavior delta" capturing the changes from fine-tuning. This allows mixing and matching different scales of pre-training and fine-tuning. 

The EFT technique relates to other work on understanding scale effects in LM pre-training vs fine-tuning:

- It formalizes and generalizes some ideas from prior work like "contrastive decoding" which also subtracted log probabilities of different scaled models. However, EFT provides a more principled basis in reinforcement learning for this operation.

- Experiments on scaling pre-training vs fine-tuning align with findings in some prior studies, though EFT enables more direct attribution of capabilities to the training stages.

- The technique of "up-scaling" small fine-tuned models relates to other work on distilling or compressing large LM knowledge into smaller models. But EFT up-scaling doesn't require separate training.

So in summary, EFT contributes a novel technique for flexibly combining scale, enables clearer analysis of scale effects, and introduces efficient up-scaling without training a separate student model. The experiments confirm and strengthen some findings from prior work. Overall it represents an advance in methodology for studying scale in LM training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several possible directions for future work:

- Applying the emulated fine-tuning (EFT) framework to study additional dimensions of model capabilities beyond just helpfulness and factuality. For example, EFT could be used to analyze capabilities like summarization, open-endedness, consistency, etc. 

- Using EFT to interpolate between other test-time model behaviors without requiring additional tuning. The paper showed interpolating between helpfulness and harmlessness, but other tradeoffs could be explored as well.

- Exploring alternative methods for efficient sampling from EFT-structured models, beyond the speculative decoding approach they proposed. Other techniques may further improve efficiency or performance.

- Validating the approach on a broader range of models, datasets, and tasks. The paper focused on instruction-following capabilities, but EFT could likely provide insights in other domains like summarization, translation, etc.

- Studying the effects of different pre-training objectives and datasets when using EFT. The base models in the paper were all pretrained in the same default way.

- Analyzing the implicit "rewards" learned during fine-tuning more closely, to better understand what specific capabilities are being acquired.

- Extending the EFT framework to settings like conditional generation, where the prompts/inputs can provide additional signal.

In summary, the authors propose future work could both broaden the scope of analysis with EFT, and also refine the methodology itself to be more efficient, align better with human preferences, and provide more detailed insights into model capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a technique called emulated fine-tuning (EFT) to decouple the scale of pre-training and fine-tuning in language model training. EFT represents a fine-tuned model as a combination of a pre-trained base model and a "behavioral delta" that captures the changes from fine-tuning. By mixing and matching base models and deltas at different scales, EFT can emulate fine-tuning a large model with a small delta or a small model with a large delta. Experiments show that scaling up pre-training improves factuality while scaling up fine-tuning improves helpfulness. EFT also enables dynamically adjusting behavior tradeoffs at test time without retraining. A special case called up-scaling ensembles a large pre-trained base model with a small fine-tuned model to emulate large-scale fine-tuning, avoiding expensive actual fine-tuning of large models. Up-scaling is shown to improve performance across multiple model families.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a technique called emulated fine-tuning (EFT) to decouple the scale of pre-training and fine-tuning in large language models. EFT represents a fine-tuned model as a combination of a pre-trained base model and a "behavior delta" capturing the changes from fine-tuning. This allows mixing a base model trained at one scale with a behavior delta from fine-tuning at another scale. 

The authors use EFT to study the effect of independently scaling pre-training and fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple models and datasets provide evidence that scaling pre-training improves factual correctness, while scaling fine-tuning improves helpfulness. EFT also enables test-time adjustment of model behaviors like trading off helpfulness and harmlessness without retraining. The authors introduce a special case called "up-scaling" which combines a small fine-tuned model with a large pre-trained model to emulate fine-tuning the large model. Up-scaling improves performance without expensive large-scale fine-tuning. Overall, EFT provides a useful technique to analyze and improve scaling of different training stages.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a technique called "emulated fine-tuning" (EFT) to decouple the scale of pre-training from the scale of fine-tuning in large language models. EFT is based on a reinforcement learning interpretation of fine-tuning, where the fine-tuned model is viewed as a policy that maximizes an implicit reward function relative to the pre-trained base model. By factorizing the fine-tuned model's logits into the base model's logits plus a "behavior delta" representing the change from fine-tuning, EFT allows mixing the base knowledge from a model pre-trained at one scale with the fine-tuning knowledge from a model fine-tuned at a different scale. For example, a large pre-trained base model can be combined with the fine-tuning knowledge from a small fine-tuned model via this factorization. The paper shows this "up-scaling" through EFT improves factuality while maintaining helpfulness compared to just using the small fine-tuned model, without needing to actually fine-tune the large model. EFT also enables interpolating between different fine-tuning objectives at test time without additional training. Overall, EFT provides a way to study the effects of scaling pre-training versus fine-tuning independently.
