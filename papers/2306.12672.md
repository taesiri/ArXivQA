# [From Word Models to World Models: Translating from Natural Language to   the Probabilistic Language of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12672)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a computational framework that combines neural models of language with symbolic models of reasoning to achieve human-like language understanding and thinking?Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called "rational meaning construction" which uses probabilistic programming to represent a structured "language of thought", and large language models to translate from natural language into this language of thought. The key ideas seem to be:- Thinking and reasoning can be modeled as Bayesian inference in structured probabilistic programs that represent possible worlds. - Understanding language involves translating utterances into expressions in this "probabilistic language of thought" in a context-sensitive way.- Large language models can be used to implement the translation from natural language to code, amortizing the process of meaning construction.- This framework allows integrating language with core domains of reasoning like probabilistic inference, physical simulation, planning, etc.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that combining neural translation models with structured symbolic reasoning in a "language of thought" can lead to more human-like language understanding and thinking in machines. The paper aims to illustrate this framework across several reasoning domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new computational framework called "rational meaning construction" for relating language to thought. The key ideas are:- Formalizing thought as probabilistic programming in a "probabilistic language of thought" (PLoT). The PLoT allows representing generative models of domains, conditioning them on observations, and performing inference to answer queries.- Formalizing linguistic meaning as a context-sensitive mapping from natural language into the PLoT. This meaning function translates sentences into PLoT code that captures their meaning with respect to the generative domain model. - Using large language models trained on code as an implementation of the meaning function. LLMs can learn mappings from language to code based on the joint distribution over language and code.- Illustrating this framework on examples from four domains - probabilistic reasoning, relational reasoning, physical/visual reasoning, and social reasoning. The examples show how language can be translated into the PLoT to drive reasoning.- Discussing how this framework could be extended to grow knowledge and construct new models, as well as open questions around scaling inference, training the translation function, connections to linguistics and cognitive science, and implications for AI.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a computational architecture, based on probabilistic programming and large language models, for integrating language with reasoning across a variety of domains in a way that is inspired by human cognition. The examples aim to illustrate the potential of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a computational framework called "rational meaning construction" that integrates neural models of language with probabilistic models of reasoning to enable systems to understand natural language input and perform human-like commonsense reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on relating language and reasoning:- It proposes a computational framework called "rational meaning construction" to explicitly connect natural language to probabilistic reasoning via large language models and probabilistic programming. This differs from most prior work that focuses on either language models or reasoning models separately.- It aims to unify strengths of classical symbolic AI with modern statistical learning approaches for language. Many recent papers have explored augmenting LLMs with logic, knowledge bases, etc. but this paper frames those as plug-ins to a broader reasoning framework.- It provides a concrete architecture and code examples using the Church probabilistic programming language and Codex to translate language. This is more detailed than most conceptual papers and shows how the framework can be implemented. - It covers reasoning in multiple domains (probabilistic, relational, perceptual, social) to make the case this approach generalizes. Most papers focus on a single domain like commonsense reasoning.- It emphasizes cognitive inspiration and human-like thinking, in contrast to a lot of ML/NLP papers aimed at benchmarks. The end goal is more an AI assistant than a pattern extractor.- It explicitly targets compositional generalization and systematic reasoning, issues with LLMs. Many papers aim to scale up LLMs without addressing their core limitations.Overall, the paper differentiates itself by providing a comprehensive framework and architecture for language and reasoning, backed by concrete examples, rather than isolated applications or models. The scope is broader and more integrated than most current research in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several important future research directions in the paper:1. Developing systems that can build new world models "on the fly" to understand novel situations and concepts encountered in language. They note that most probabilistic programming languages assume a fixed world model, while human cognition seems more flexible. Future work could explore dynamically synthesizing and adapting probabilistic programs to incrementally construct situation-specific world models.2. Scaling up probabilistic inference capabilities to match the speed, efficiency and flexibility of human thought. The rejection sampling algorithm used in the examples has limitations, so research on more advanced Monte Carlo and variational inference methods tailored for probabilistic programs could help. The authors also suggest meta-programming approaches where inference strategies are synthesized dynamically. 3. Exploring the interplay between amortized/neural translation and more explicit probabilistic inference for pragmatics and world knowledge. Future systems could flexibly trade off learned neural predictions and structured symbolic operations. New training methods could compile explicit symbolic inferences into amortized neural networks over time.4. Extending the approach to language generation, by using world models and listener models to select utterances that provoke intended belief updates. This could address truthfulness problems in neural text generation.5. Leveraging the framework to build more sample-efficient models that acquire language from less data, possibly via a progression of symbolic and statistical models. This could better match human language learning trajectories.6. Using the approach as a tool to interpret other language systems, including brains and black-box neural models. The symbolic reasoning traces could shed light on implicit computations.7. Architecting more modular, transparent and verifiable AI systems for language understanding, by separating symbolic reasoning engines from neural translation modules. This could improve robustness.In summary, the authors lay out research directions focused on scalability, transparency, sample efficiency and biological plausibility that build on their rational meaning construction framework bridging neural translation and probabilistic programming.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a computational framework called "rational meaning construction" for modeling how humans understand language and relate it to thought. The key idea is to combine neural models of language (large language models like GPT-3) with symbolic models of reasoning (probabilistic programs). Specifically, they model linguistic meaning as a mapping from natural language into a "probabilistic language of thought" - a symbolic substrate for representing knowledge, beliefs, and inferences. Large language models can learn this mapping between language and symbolic code. The symbolic code can then be executed to perform coherent reasoning and inference. This combines the broad coverage and generalization of neural models with the systematicity and interpretability of symbolic reasoning. The authors illustrate the approach on examples of probabilistic reasoning, relational reasoning, physical/visual reasoning, and social reasoning. They argue this architecture could lead to more human-like AI systems that learn from less data and enable more robust reasoning. The paper lays out connections to cognitive science theories of language and cognition and suggests directions for future work in improving inference, translation, and learning in this framework.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:Paragraph 1: This paper proposes a computational framework called "rational meaning construction" for relating language to thought. The key idea is to model linguistic meaning as a context-sensitive mapping from natural language into a "probabilistic language of thought" that supports probabilistic inference for reasoning. The framework combines neural models of language (large language models like GPT) with probabilistic models for inference (probabilistic programming languages like Church). The large language model acts as a meaning function, translating natural language into code expressions in the probabilistic language. The probabilistic programming language then performs reasoning and inference conditioned on the translated language. Paragraph 2: The paper illustrates this framework through examples in four core domains - probabilistic reasoning, logical/relational reasoning, visual/physical reasoning, and social reasoning. In each domain, natural language is translated into probabilistic programs that interface with relevant reasoning engines like graphics renderers or physics simulators. This allows the system to answer queries and make inferences about situations described in natural language. The paper argues this approach combines strengths of classical symbolic AI and modern neural networks - the broad coverage and neural efficiency of large language models for translating language, with the systematic inferential capacities of probabilistic programs for reasoning. It outlines open questions around improving inference, translation, and learning under this paradigm.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a framework called "rational meaning construction" for relating language to thought. The key idea is to translate natural language into a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT) in order to perform reasoning. The PLoT is implemented using probabilistic programming, which allows expressing generative models over possible world states. These world models support coherent probabilistic inference to answer queries and condition on observations expressed in natural language. Translation from natural language into the PLoT is performed by a large language model (LLM) trained on language-code pairs, which serves as a flexible mapping from sentences to program expressions. The framework is illustrated through examples in several domains, including probabilistic reasoning, relational reasoning, visual/physical reasoning, and social reasoning. In each case, natural language is translated into probabilistic programs that define the relevant world models and queries/conditions. The resulting system integrates the broad coverage and generalization abilities of LLMs with the structured reasoning afforded by probabilistic programs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the question of how language relates to and informs human cognition and thought. More specifically, it is proposing a computational framework for modeling how humans make meaning from language and use language to drive reasoning and inference across different domains like probabilistic reasoning, logic, visual perception, intuitive physics, and social reasoning. Some key problems and questions the paper seems to be tackling:- How can we computationally model the process of constructing meaning from language in a way that interfaces language with core domains of human reasoning and cognition?- How can we leverage insights from classical symbolic AI as well as modern neural language models to build integrated models of language understanding?- How can neural translation models be used to map language into structured symbolic representations to support logical, coherent reasoning?- How can probabilistic programming languages serve as a general "language of thought" to represent meanings and drive inference?- How can we model the acquisition of new concepts and construction of new world models based on language input?- How can neural models be trained more efficiently to acquire language in a more human-like way?- How can neural models be incorporated into more interpretable, verifiable, and systematic reasoning architectures?So in summary, the key focus seems to be on developing a unified computational theory and framework that brings together neural and symbolic approaches to model human-like language understanding and reasoning. The paper aims to address limitations of both classical symbolic systems and modern neural models when used in isolation.
