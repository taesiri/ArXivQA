## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents MorpheuS, a method for reconstructing 360-degree surfaces of dynamic objects from monocular RGB-D video. The approach represents the scene using a canonical field encoding geometry and appearance, along with a deformation field that warps points from the current frame to this canonical space. To achieve realistic completion of unobserved regions, MorpheuS incorporates a view-dependent diffusion prior (Zero-1-to-3) and distills knowledge from it using score distillation sampling. A temporal view-dependent strategy is proposed for this sampling to capture object motion over time. Experiments demonstrate that MorpheuS produces high-fidelity 360-degree reconstructions on various real-world and synthetic datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods like NDR, MorpheuS achieves more accurate surface reconstruction in observed regions and significantly more realistic completion in unobserved areas thanks to guidance from the diffusion prior. Key components analyzed include the benefits of the diffusion prior, temporal view conditioning, surface normal smoothing, and canonical space regularization. Limitations still exist for very challenging poses and motion. Overall, the integration of implicit neural representation with data-driven diffusion priors enables compelling 360-degree dynamic scene reconstruction from RGB-D video.
