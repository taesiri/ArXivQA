# [Mitigating Dialogue Hallucination for Large Multi-modal Models via   Adversarial Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10492)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large multi-modal models (LMMs) are prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or nonsensical outputs inconsistent with the given inputs. 
- Prior work mainly focused on object hallucinations. However, the effect of preceding user-system dialogues on exacerbating hallucinations has not been studied.

Key Ideas:  
- The authors introduce the notion of "dialogue hallucination", where preceding dialogues cause LMMs to generate hallucinated and incorrect answers to subsequent questions.
- They construct EvalDial, an evaluation benchmark covering 7 multi-modal datasets, to precisely measure dialogue hallucination. It prepends 3 types of dialogues (general, random, adversarial) before each test example.
- They propose Adversarial Question Generator (AQG) which automatically generates subtle yet adversarial image-related questions that can hallucinate LMMs.

Analysis:
- Input token attention analysis reveals prediction bias towards dialogues rather than visual input causes dialogue hallucination.  

Proposed Solution - Adversarial Instruction Tuning (AIT):
- Augments instruction datasets by prepending hallucinatory dialogues and fine-tunes LMM in a robust manner.
- Uses masked loss to avoid training on hallucinated dialogues.  

Results:
- AIT reduces dialogue hallucination, maintaining or even improving performance on EvalDial.
- Analyzed impact of number of adversarial dialogues and size of augmented dataset.

Main Contributions:  
- Identify and formulate dialogue hallucination problem
- Construct EvalDial benchmark and propose AQG method  
- Perform analysis revealing prediction bias causes hallucinations
- Propose AIT method that successfully mitigates dialogue hallucination


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new evaluation benchmark and adversarial training method to mitigate dialogue hallucination of large multi-modal models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1) The authors find that large multi-modal models (LMMs) are prone to hallucination when preceded by dialogues from prior user-system interactions. 

2) They present EvalDial, an evaluation benchmark built on top of popular VQA and image captioning datasets, along with a novel adversarial question generator (AQG) to precisely measure dialogue hallucination.

3) Through input token attention analysis, they reveal that dialogue hallucination is mainly caused by LMMs' over-reliance or bias towards preceding dialogues rather than visual input. 

4) They propose Adversarial Instruction Tuning (AIT), a robust fine-tuning method that trains LMMs on augmented visual instruction datasets containing adversarial dialogues. AIT uses masked loss to reduce LMMs' bias towards adversarial dialogues.

5) Extensive experiments show AIT successfully mitigates dialogue hallucination while maintaining or even improving LMMs' performance on VQA and captioning tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a method (AIT) to make large multi-modal models more robust against hallucinations induced by preceding dialogues. The EvalDial benchmark and analysis into causes of dialogue hallucination also represent significant contributions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Dialogue hallucination - The phenomenon where preceding user-system dialogues cause large language models to generate unfaithful or incorrect responses. This is the main problem investigated in the paper.

- Adversarial Question Generator (AQG) - A method proposed in the paper to automatically generate adversarial, image-related dialogues that can be used to evaluate dialogue hallucination. 

- EvalDial - An evaluation benchmark constructed by the authors to precisely measure dialogue hallucination of large multimodal models, using datasets for VQA and image captioning.

- Dialogue Tokens Attention Ratio (DTAR) - A proposed attention-based metric to analyze the contribution of preceding dialogues to model predictions and understand when dialogue hallucination happens.

- Adversarial Instruction Tuning (AIT) - The main method proposed to mitigate dialogue hallucination. It robustly fine-tunes models by injecting hallucinatory dialogues into the training data and masking their loss.

- Large multimodal models (LMMs) - Refers to large language models that have been aligned with visual foundations models to support instruction-following in visual domains. Evaluated models include LLaMA, MiniGPT, and InstructBLIP.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose an adversarial instruction tuning (AIT) method to mitigate dialogue hallucination in large multi-modal models (LMMs). Can you elaborate on why existing instruction tuning methods are not sufficient to handle this problem? What specific aspects make dialogue hallucination more challenging to address?

2. The paper introduces a new metric called Dialogue Tokens Attention Ratio (DTAR) to analyze the root cause of dialogue hallucination. Can you explain the intuition behind using gradient-based attention to quantify the reliance on dialog history versus visual input? How does this provide insight into the hallucination phenomenon?  

3. The adversarial question generator (AQG) is a key component for creating augmented adversarial training data in AIT. What threat model guided the design of AQG? Why is it important to generate questions that are not only adversarial but also image-related and natural sounding?

4. The paper shows AIT is effective at mitigating hallucination while maintaining or even improving overall performance. What is the hypothesized mechanism by which masked loss enables more robust learning? Does the model essentially learn to disregard unreliable dialog history?

5. Ablation studies reveal that injecting more rounds of hallucinatory dialog per example and using more augmented adversarial data both enhance AIT's effectiveness. Is there a risk that too much artificial noise could hurt generalization? If so, how can that tradeoff be managed?  

6. Could the ideas in AIT extend to other modalities besides vision+language, for example to mitigate audio or video based hallucinations? What challenges might arise in those settings?

7. The paper focuses on zero-shot evaluation of hallucination mitigation. Would you expect similar gains in a fine-tuned setting? Could AIT complement other techniques like self-supervised verification pre-training?

8. What other analysis could further confirm that AIT reduces reliance on dialog history specifically? For example, how might input or hidden state perturbations reveal if dialog sensitivity is reduced?

9. The hallucination problem studied arises from dialog interactions with an LMM system. Do you think similar issues could manifest even for a single user query if the model has been polluted by prior dialogs? 

10. Beyond the classification and language generation tasks studied, how might hallucination from historical dialogs impact an LMM's performance on dialog state tracking, consistency, or multitask capabilities? Could AIT also be beneficial in those areas?
