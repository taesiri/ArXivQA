# [WoVoGen: World Volume-aware Diffusion for Controllable Multi-camera   Driving Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02934)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating high-quality, multi-camera street view videos with consistency across sensors and time is critical for autonomous driving but challenging. Rendering-based methods lack diversity while diffusion-based methods using sparse inputs like bounding boxes struggle to ensure complete scene understanding and coherence.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes World Volume-aware Multi-camera Driving Scene Generator (WoVoGen) which incorporates an explicit 4D world volume representation to guide video generation. It has two key stages:

1) Future World Volume Generation: An autoencoder compresses world volumes (occupancy grids + HD maps) into 2D latents which are fed into a temporal diffusion model conditioned on past world volumes and vehicle actions to predict future world volumes.

2) Multi-Camera Video Generation: The predicted 4D world volumes are encoded into features using CLIP and 3D convolutions. These features are projected onto each camera view and serve as conditional inputs alongside text prompts to a panoptic diffusion model which ensures consistency across views. Temporal attention blocks also enforce frame coherence.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel framework to incorporate explicit world volume representation into diffusion-based driving video generation for consistency.

2) Two-phase strategy of first forecasting future world then generating videos conditioned on it. 

3) State-of-the-art multi-camera video generation quality. Also enables controllable editing by modifying world volumes.

In summary, WoVoGen advances the state-of-the-art in consistent and high-quality driving scene video synthesis by integrating structured world knowledge into conditional diffusion models.
