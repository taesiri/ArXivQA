# [Guiding drones by information gain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03947)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately estimating the location and emission rate (flux) of greenhouse gas sources is important for climate projections and emissions monitoring. However, directly observing these "source term" parameters is challenging. 
- Instead, they must be inferred from gas concentration measurements, which provide incomplete and noisy observations. Determining optimal sampling trajectories for mobile sensors to constrain uncertainty in source term estimates remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores and compares two approaches for informative path planning of drones to address the source term estimation (STE) problem:
  1. Infotaxis: An online greedy search strategy that aims to maximize immediate information gain at each step.
  2. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL): Develops a far-sighted sampling strategy to maximize cumulative information gain over the full trajectory.  
- Both methods utilize Bayesian inference to maintain a belief (probability distribution) over possible source locations and fluxes. They incentivize actions that reduce uncertainty in this belief through an information-based reward.

Key Contributions:
- Applies DRL with information-based rewards for joint source localization and flux estimation under field constraints (limited flight time, noisy observations).
- Compares DRL (using a convolutional neural network) against infotaxis in non-isotropic turbulent plumes.
- Shows DRL attains higher success rate and lower uncertainty in source term belief across varying source flux values and wind speeds.
- Discusses implementation challenges and future work to extend to heterogeneous sources and realistic atmospheric conditions.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that a DRL approach guided by information gain as a reward signal can outperform greedy infotaxis for source term estimation using mobile gas sensors. This is a promising step towards optimal planning of greenhouse gas measurement campaigns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates and compares two drone sampling strategies - an information-gain based deep reinforcement learning approach and infotaxis - for inferring source location and emission rate of gas plumes from atmospheric concentration measurements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are summarized in the Introduction section:

(a) Application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address the source term estimation (STE) problem under pertinent constraints for greenhouse gas mapping in the field - considering unknown source locations, fixed flight time due to battery limitations, and noisy observations by the sensor. 

(b) Comparing the performance of DRL with an information-based reward to infotaxis, a greedy policy that maximizes expected information gain at each step.

(c) Comparison between two neural network architectures for approximating the DRL policy: a feed forward structure with fully connected layers and a convolutional neural network.

In essence, the key contribution is using DRL to develop an informative path planning strategy for a drone to efficiently estimate source locations and emission rates of greenhouse gases under real-world constraints, and showing that this DRL approach can outperform a myopic infotaxis policy. The paper also provides insights into suitable neural network architectures for this problem.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using Bayesian inference to maintain a probability distribution over the unknown source term parameters. Could you expand more on how the Bayesian updating works in this context? What are the challenges with scaling the Bayesian computations as the number of parameters increases?

2. The paper compares an information-greedy infotaxis strategy with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based strategy that considers long-term rewards. Could you explain more about why the DRL agent is able to develop a more far-sighted strategy compared to infotaxis? What are the key mechanisms and network architecture choices that enable this?

3. The paper demonstrates superior performance of DRL over infotaxis for non-isotropic plumes. Could you discuss more deeply the reasons why infotaxis struggles in such scenarios? What specifically about the infotaxis assumptions and formulations causes it to falter? 

4. The paper mentions using an information entropy based reward function for both infotaxis and DRL. What are the benefits of using an information-theoretic reward versus a more traditional distance-based reward? What are some of the challenges in implementing and optimizing for an information entropy reward?

5. Could you expand more on the key differences between the convolutional neural network (CNN) and fully connected (FC) network architectures explored? Why does the CNN perform slightly better than the FC network in this application? What are some ways the networks could be improved further?

6. The paper assumes a single source parameterization. How could the method be extended to account for multiple interacting sources? What changes would need to be made to the observation and plume models? How does the problem complexity grow with additional sources?

7. What forms of uncertainty are considered in the plume model and observations? What additional uncertainties could exist in real-world deployment that are not modeled here? How sensitive are the results to different uncertainty assumptions and levels?

8. How was the discretization of source locations and fluxes chosen? Could the results be sensitive to the spacing of this discretization? What are some ways the discretization could be adapted or improved?

9. The paper mentions the possibility of combining mobile and static sensors. How specifically could observations from fixed sensors be incorporated into the modeling and inference? What benefits might this provide over a purely mobile sensing approach?

10. What are the most significant challenges and bottlenecks that need to be addressed to transition this work from simulation to real-world implementation on drone platforms? Could you discuss any needed modifications or enhancements to the methodology?
