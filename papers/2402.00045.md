# [Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00045)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper provides the first comprehensive survey on detecting multimedia content generated by large AI models (LAIMs), including text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal media. 

LAIMs like diffusion models and large language models can generate highly realistic fake multimedia content, which brings many benefits but also risks of misuse and harm. Effective detection of AI-generated content is crucial for ensuring information integrity and ethics. 

However, there is currently a lack of systematic analysis specifically focused on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. This paper aims to fill that gap and support the advancement of research in this important area.

The authors first give a brief technical background on how LAIMs generate various types of multimedia content. They summarize key public datasets available for training detection models. 

A novel taxonomy is then introduced to categorize detection methods for each modality into "Pure Detection" (improving accuracy) and "Beyond Detection" (adding attributes like robustness and explainability). Subcategories provide more fine-grained classification based on common features.  

Current popular online detection tools are evaluated, highlighting strengths and limitations. Challenges faced in reliable and fair detection are pinpointed, like lack of model generalizability, interpretability, and robustness against attacks.

Future directions are proposed to address gaps, including building multimodal foundation models, utilizing generative discrepancies for detection, prioritizing detector reliability and fairness, accelerating multimodal research, and enhancing tool interpretability.

By providing organized analysis spanning detection data, models, tools and challenges, this survey meaningfully contributes to research aligned with ensuring authenticity in our increasingly AI-integrated digital information ecosystem.
