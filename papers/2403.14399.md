# [Building Accurate Translation-Tailored LLMs with Language Aware   Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on translation data show promising translation capabilities, even outperforming some supervised models. However, they suffer from a significant "off-target translation" problem, especially for low-resource languages, where the model fails to generate translations in the correct target language as instructed. 

- This paper attributes the off-target problem to the weak ability of LLM models to follow the language direction instructions properly during translation.

Method:  
- A two-stage fine-tuning approach is proposed to enhance the model's ability to follow translation instructions:
  1) Pre-tune the LLM on multilingual translation data to unlock its translation capability
  2) Construct "instruction-conflicting" samples by replacing translation directions in the instructions with incorrect ones, and use these samples for unlikelihood training to emphasize the effect of instructions

- Unlikelihood training encourages lower model probability on unlikely samples, while maintaining high probability on real samples. This emphasizes the importance of following instructions properly.

Contributions:
- Reveals and analyzes the significant off-target translation problem with LLMs for low-resource zero-shot translation
- Attributes the problem to weak translation instruction following capability of LLMs  
- Introduces instruction-conflicting samples and unlikelihood training to improve instruction following ability
- Achieves much lower off-target ratios and improved translation quality across 16 zero-shot directions. Effectiveness persists with increasing model size.
- Maintains supervised translation quality and general capabilities on other tasks.

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights into the weaknesses of LLMs for translation, and proposes an effective fine-tuning technique to enhance their instruction following capability, significantly improving zero-shot translation performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-stage finetuning strategy with unlikelihood training on instruction-conflicting samples to enhance the instruction-following ability of LLMs for translation, effectively reducing the off-target translation ratio and improving translation quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It reveals the heavy off-target problem in LLM-based zero-shot translation settings, and attributes this problem to the weak instruction (translation direction) following ability.

2. To fundamentally improve the translation direction following ability, it introduces a two-stage fine-tuning algorithm for LLMs that leverages instruction-conflicting samples.

3. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating the off-target problem and producing better translations. Analyses show that the method does not affect the general ability of LLM on other tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Zero-shot translation
- Instruction tuning
- Off-target translation
- Unlikelihood training
- Instruction-conflicting samples
- Translation-tailored LLMs
- Multilingual translation dataset 
- IWSLT and WMT benchmarks
- SacreBLEU, BLEURT metrics
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) loss
- Likelihood updates and unlikelihood updates

The paper proposes a two-stage fine-tuning algorithm to improve the instruction-following ability of LLMs for translation tasks, especially adhering to the correct translation direction specified in the instructions. The key ideas involve creating instruction-conflicting samples by changing translation directions, and using an unlikelihood loss to train the model to avoid producing translations that conflict with the instructions. Experiments on 16 zero-shot translation directions demonstrate reductions in off-target translations and quality improvements.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces instruction-conflicting samples for unlikelihood training. What are other potential ways to create effective negative samples for enhancing instruction following in large language models?

2. How does the mixing parameter Î± allow balancing between likelihood and unlikelihood losses? What adaptive or automated approaches could be used to set this parameter instead of manual tuning?  

3. The two-stage fine-tuning approach first unlocks translation capabilities then enhances instruction following. Would reversing the order of these stages be equally or more effective? Why or why not?

4. Could the unlikelihood training approach be applied to multilingual translation models based on an encoder-decoder architecture? What modifications would need to be made? 

5. The method is evaluated on 16 zero-shot translation directions. How could the approach be extended to even lower resource languages not seen during pretraining?

6. What other decoder-only architectures besides LLaMA could this approach be applied to? Would modifications be needed to adapt it?

7. How does performance compare when applying the method to larger versus smaller pretrained language models? Is there a point of diminishing returns?

8. Could this unlikelihood training approach help mitigate other types of hallucinations like fact-conflicting or context-conflicting?

9. For supervised translation directions, does retaining translation ability come at a cost to performance after unlikelihood training? How could any declines be prevented?

10. How does unlikelihood training for translation instruction following compare against other techniques like prompt/instruction engineering methods? What are the tradeoffs?
