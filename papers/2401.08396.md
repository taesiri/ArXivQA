# [Hidden Flaws Behind Expert-Level Accuracy of GPT-4 Vision in Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08396)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Recent studies showed that GPT-4 Vision (GPT-4V), a multimodal AI model, outperforms human physicians on medical challenge questions. However, these evaluations primarily focused on multi-choice accuracy alone and did not thoroughly analyze the rationales behind GPT-4V's responses.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of GPT-4V's performance on 100 NEJM Image Challenge questions. Specifically, the authors evaluate GPT-4V's image comprehension, recall of medical knowledge, and step-by-step reasoning when answering these questions. They also compare GPT-4V's performance to that of a senior medical student and a team of 9 physicians under closed-book and open-book settings.

Key Findings:
- GPT-4V significantly outperforms physicians in closed-book settings on multi-choice accuracy (88% vs 77%). It also answers correctly over 80% of questions physicians got wrong.  
- However, in 27% of cases where GPT-4V made the right final choice, it had flawed rationales - most prominently in image comprehension (22% error rate).
- Image comprehension was the most problematic area for GPT-4V (21% error rate), while medical knowledge recall was the most reliable (12-15% error rate).
- For hard questions, open-book physicians significantly outperformed GPT-4V, suggesting its utility for complex cases may be limited.

Main Contributions:
- First study to systematically evaluate GPT-4V's rationales across image comprehension, knowledge recall, and reasoning.  
- Identified image comprehension as a key challenge for GPT-4V despite high multi-choice accuracy.
- Showed the need to go beyond accuracy alone when evaluating these models before clinical integration.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4V's performance and rationales on 100 NEJM image challenge questions, finding it surpasses physicians in closed-book accuracy but has flawed rationales in over 20% of cases, especially in image comprehension.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4V's rationales when solving medical image challenge questions. Specifically:

1) The paper evaluates GPT-4V's performance on 100 NEJM image challenge questions across 3 capabilities - image comprehension, recall of medical knowledge, and step-by-step reasoning. This is more extensive than prior work which primarily focused only on multi-choice accuracy. 

2) The study finds that while GPT-4V achieves higher multi-choice accuracy than human physicians in closed-book settings (88% vs 77%), it still makes flawed rationales in 27.3% of cases even when answering correctly. This highlights the need to evaluate the rationales, not just the final choices.

3) Image comprehension is identified as the most problematic area, with a 21.6% error rate. In contrast, recall of medical knowledge has a lower 10.2% error rate. This suggests directions for future improvement.

4) The study includes systematic annotation and evaluation of GPT-4V's rationales by a team of 9 physicians across specialties. Prior works mainly conducted ad-hoc or limited rationale analysis.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive rationale-based evaluation methodology and findings that provide insights into GPT-4V's true reasoning abilities in medical visual tasks.

The paper evaluates GPT-4V on its accuracy and rationales in answering multimodal medical challenge questions from NEJM Image Challenge. It compares GPT-4V's performance to that of medical students and physicians in both closed-book and open-book settings. The key focus is assessing whether GPT-4V's correct final choices are based on sound underlying rationales across image comprehension, knowledge recall, and reasoning. The end goal is evaluating if such models can be integrated into clinical decision support workflows.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. Why was the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Image Challenge chosen as the dataset for evaluating GPT-4V's capabilities? What are the key advantages and limitations of using this dataset?

2. The paper mentions using a specifically designed prompt to elicit structured responses from GPT-4V. Can you explain the rationale behind the design of this prompt and how it facilitates the evaluation? 

3. What are the potential biases introduced by having the medical student and physicians annotate the rationales of GPT-4V? How could the evaluation procedure be improved to reduce annotation biases?  

4. What additional analyses could be performed on the collected dataset to further assess GPT-4V's capabilities and limitations (e.g. correlation of errors with question attributes)?

5. The paper identifies image comprehension as the most problematic area for GPT-4V. What deficiencies in vision capabilities could contribute to this? How might GPT-4V be enhanced to improve image comprehension?

6. Could the high performance of GPT-4V on multiple choice questions give a false sense of its true reasoning capabilities? What changes to the evaluation methodology could better assess reasoning?

7. How robust is the evaluation result to variations in the prompt design? What experiments could be conducted to test prompt dependence? 

8. What are the limitations of evaluating performance on questions with a single correct answer? How should the model be evaluated for clinical scenarios with multiple reasonable diagnoses?

9. The paper does not evaluate model calibration. How could the rationales be used to assess whether GPT-4V knows when it doesn't know? 

10. What additional in-depth analyses could be performed to compare GPT-4V's capabilities and reasoning approach to that of physicians? What might this reveal about the differences?
