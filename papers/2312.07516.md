# [Learning finitely correlated states: stability of the spectral   reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07516)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper develops a learning algorithm to reconstruct the marginal states of translation invariant finitely correlated quantum states on spin chains. Finitely correlated states have efficient tensor network representations and arise naturally when a quantum channel is applied repeatedly on a finite-dimensional quantum memory system. The algorithm estimates a marginal state of the spin chain from measurement samples, uses matrix algebra to construct a tensor network, and recursively propagates errors to bound the trace distance between the reconstructed and true marginals. The number of measurement copies scales quadratically with chain length, with explicit dependence on memory dimension and singular values of certain correlation matrices. This spectral learning technique applies directly to matrix product states and operator-theoretic quantum stochastic processes with memory, providing the first rigorous error bounds for this quantum generalization of hidden Markov models. Generalizations to finite chains, Gibbs state approximations, and robustness to states that are only close to finitely correlated are discussed. The algorithm's sample complexity and computational tractability make it a promising avenue for learning quantum many-body states.
