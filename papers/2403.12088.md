# [TMU at TREC Clinical Trials Track 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper describes Toronto Metropolitan University's participation in the TREC 2023 Clinical Trials Track. The goal of the track is to retrieve the most relevant clinical trials for a given patient profile summarized in a topic template. The topic templates consist of fields related to the patient's disorder (e.g. glaucoma, COPD) such as symptoms, medications, test results, etc. The retrieved clinical trials are from ClinicalTrials.gov and have inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine patient eligibility.

The paper proposes using neural language models to match the patient profiles in the topic templates to the clinical trial descriptions. They extract the summary, description, eligibility criteria from the XML data of the clinical trials. They compare two methods for feature extraction and similarity computation between topics and trials: Sentence Transformers (RoBERTa-large encoder) and Doc2Vec. 

After embedding the topics and trials, they compute cosine similarity between them to retrieve the top 1000 most similar clinical trials per topic. They submit 4 runs using different configurations and evaluate using standard IR measures like NDCG, Precision and Recall. The Sentence Transformer runs achieve substantially better performance than Doc2Vec, with the best run achieving NDCG@10 of 0.1748.

In conclusion, they demonstrate the ability of state-of-the-art neural language models to effectively match patient profiles to relevant clinical trials for recruitment purposes. The Sentence Transformer methods can differentiate between eligible, excluded and non-relevant trials based on semantic similarity. This has the potential to improve clinical trial recruitment and precision medicine through automated profile matching.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper describes Toronto Metropolitan University's approach of using neural language models like Sentence Transformers and Doc2Vec to retrieve and rank relevant clinical trials for given patient profiles based on similarity between the patient profile text and clinical trial text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be the authors' participation in the TREC Clinical Trials Track 2023. Specifically:

- They utilize advanced natural language processing techniques and neural language models to retrieve the most relevant clinical trials for given patient topic templates. 

- They extract features from the topics and trials using Sentence Transformers (RoBERTa-large model) and Doc2Vec to compute similarity scores between topics and trials.

- They submit 4 different runs using these methods and evaluate the results. The Sentence Transformer runs achieve better performance in terms of NDCG scores compared to Doc2Vec.

- They present their overall methodology, experiments, results, and analysis around using these neural models for clinical trial retrieval for the TREC track.

So in summary, the key contribution is participating in the track, applying neural IR techniques, and analyzing their relative effectiveness for this clinical trial retrieval task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes two different techniques for feature extraction - SentenceTransformers and Doc2Vec. What are the key differences in the underlying architecture and objective functions between these two methods? What could potentially make SentenceTransformers more suitable for this task compared to Doc2Vec?

2. The SentenceTransformers model uses a RoBERTa-large architecture. What are some of the architectural differences between RoBERTa and the original BERT model? Why does using a larger model like RoBERTa-large lead to better sentence embeddings? 

3. The paper computes the similarity between the topic template and trial documents using cosine similarity. What are some limitations of using cosine similarity? Could other similarity metrics like Manhattan or Jaccard distance work better for matching patient profiles to trials?

4. For data preparation, the paper extracts specific XML tags like brief_summary and eligibility from the trial corpus. What kind of important information could be missed by only using these select tags? Would incorporating other tags lead to better trial retrieval?  

5. The paper reports overall performance across all topics. Is there significant variability in performance across different disease topics? If so, what factors related to the topic template design could contribute to this?

6. How optimal are the NDCG cut-offs used for evaluation, i.e. 5, 10 15 and 20? Would changing these cut-offs significantly impact the relative performance of the different runs? 

7. The paper computes similarity between the full topic template and complete trial documents. Would a two-stage approach - first narrowing down by similarity between eligibility criteria help improve results?

8. For translating profiles to queries, what are some limitations of relying only on the textual narrative without any structured data? Would incorporating other data help?

9. The trial data set is derived from ClinicalTrials.gov. How well would this approach work for other proprietary trial data sources with less standardized metadata/eligibility criteria?

10. The paper reports aggregate evaluation metrics for the methods. What additional evaluation is needed to assess utility in suggesting trials for individual patients in a real clinical setting?
