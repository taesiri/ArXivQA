# [TMU at TREC Clinical Trials Track 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper describes Toronto Metropolitan University's participation in the TREC 2023 Clinical Trials Track. The goal of the track is to retrieve the most relevant clinical trials for a given patient profile summarized in a topic template. The topic templates consist of fields related to the patient's disorder (e.g. glaucoma, COPD) such as symptoms, medications, test results, etc. The retrieved clinical trials are from ClinicalTrials.gov and have inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine patient eligibility.

The paper proposes using neural language models to match the patient profiles in the topic templates to the clinical trial descriptions. They extract the summary, description, eligibility criteria from the XML data of the clinical trials. They compare two methods for feature extraction and similarity computation between topics and trials: Sentence Transformers (RoBERTa-large encoder) and Doc2Vec. 

After embedding the topics and trials, they compute cosine similarity between them to retrieve the top 1000 most similar clinical trials per topic. They submit 4 runs using different configurations and evaluate using standard IR measures like NDCG, Precision and Recall. The Sentence Transformer runs achieve substantially better performance than Doc2Vec, with the best run achieving NDCG@10 of 0.1748.

In conclusion, they demonstrate the ability of state-of-the-art neural language models to effectively match patient profiles to relevant clinical trials for recruitment purposes. The Sentence Transformer methods can differentiate between eligible, excluded and non-relevant trials based on semantic similarity. This has the potential to improve clinical trial recruitment and precision medicine through automated profile matching.
