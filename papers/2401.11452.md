# [Towards Reliable and Factual Response Generation: Detecting Unanswerable   Questions in Information-Seeking Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11452)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models used for conversational response generation face the issue of hallucinations, which can undermine users' trust. 
- Simply retrieving relevant passages does not guarantee the presence of the actual answer to the user's question.
- There is a need for detecting unanswerable questions in conversational information seeking where the answer is not contained in the corpus or could not be retrieved. This is an open problem without existing solutions or datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- Treat conversational search as a two-step process - first retrieve relevant passages, then summarize into a final response.
- Introduce an additional step of answerability prediction after passage retrieval and before response generation.
- Employ a sentence-level classifier to detect if the answer is present in each sentence.
- Aggregate predictions at passage level and across top retrieved passages to estimate overall answerability.

Main Contributions:
- New dataset called CAsT-answerability, based on TREC CAsT, with answerability labels at sentence, passage and ranking levels.
- Controlled rankings with varying difficulty levels for answerability prediction.
- Baseline approach using sentence-level classifier and multi-level aggregation that outperforms ChatGPT on answerability detection. 
- Analysis showing sentence-level augmentation helps but does not directly translate to better ranking-level predictions.
- Strong baselines for a novel task with potential for more advanced solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for detecting unanswerable questions in conversational information seeking by using a sentence-level classifier to identify sentences containing answers, aggregating these predictions to assess answerability at the passage and ranking levels, and demonstrates that this approach outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 on the answerability prediction task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would summarize the main contributions as follows:

1) The authors develop a new dataset, called CAsT-answerability, for training and evaluating methods for question answerability prediction in conversational information seeking. The dataset is built on top of the TREC CAsT benchmark and contains binary answerability labels at the sentence, passage, and ranking levels.

2) The authors propose a baseline method for answerability prediction that employs a sentence-level classifier to identify sentences that contribute to the answer. These sentence-level predictions are aggregated at the passage and then ranking levels to arrive at a final answerability estimate for a given question and set of retrieved passages. 

3) The authors demonstrate that their proposed baseline method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5, a state-of-the-art large language model, on the ranking-level answerability prediction task. This indicates that their method provides a strong baseline for future work on this novel task of answerability detection in conversational search.

In summary, the key innovations presented in the paper are: (1) a new benchmark dataset for answerability, (2) a baseline method for answerability prediction, and (3) experimental results showing the promise of their approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step process for conversational response generation - passage retrieval followed by summarization. What are some challenges or limitations of this approach compared to end-to-end generative models?

2. The core of the proposed method is a sentence-level classifier to detect whether a sentence contains part of the answer. What are some ways this classifier could be improved, for example by incorporating semantic similarity measures between the question and sentence? 

3. The paper experiments with max and mean aggregation functions to combine sentence-level predictions. What are some other aggregation methods that could be explored and what are their potential advantages?

4. For training the sentence-level classifier, the paper experiments with augmenting the CAsT data with SQuAD 2.0 data. Why does this augmentation help sentence-level prediction but not passage or ranking-level? What other external datasets could be used?

5. The ranking-level results are obtained by generating rankings with varying degrees of answerability. What impact could the ranking generation strategy have on model performance? What other strategies could be used?

6. The paper frames answerability prediction as a binary task. How could a more nuanced scale for answerability (e.g. partial vs full) impact the problem formulation and proposed methods?

7. The paper compares against ChatGPT for answerability prediction. What other model architectures or approaches would be useful to benchmark against? What are limitations of the ChatGPT comparison?

8. Beyond improving answerability prediction itself, how could the predictions be utilized, for example to communicate uncertainty or trigger clarification questions in a conversational system?

9. What additional annotations could augment the dataset to support answerability prediction, for example marking information that provides supporting evidence?

10. The paper focuses on extractive methods for identifying answers in text. How could the proposed ideas extend to a generative response generation setup? What additional challenges might arise?
