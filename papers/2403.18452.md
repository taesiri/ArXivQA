# [SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18452)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There are five main trajectory prediction tasks: stochastic, deterministic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot prediction. Despite taking sequential coordinates as input and outputting future paths, specialized architectures are still needed for each task leading to generality issues and sub-optimal performance. 

Solution - SingularTrajectory Framework:
The paper proposes a universal trajectory prediction framework called SingularTrajectory to reduce the performance gap across tasks. The main ideas are:

1) Build a Singular space to project motion patterns from all tasks into one unified embedding space representing human dynamics. This is done using truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the trajectory dataset.

2) Propose an adaptive anchor in Singular space to generate prototype paths. It corrects wrongly located prototypes based on a traversability map from the scene image.

3) Adopt a diffusion model to refine the prototype paths into socially-acceptable trajectories using a cascaded denoising process. Historical paths, interactions, and environment context guide this process.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce the Singular space to unify representations of human dynamics across tasks.
- Develop an adaptive anchor system to incorporate environmental context. 
- Design a diffusion-based model architecture for trajectory prediction that leverages the Singular space and adaptive anchor.
- Achieve new state-of-the-art results across five public benchmarks covering the major trajectory prediction tasks.

The unified framework ensures generalizability across tasks without specialized tuning. Experiments demonstrate superiority over existing specialized models, highlighting effectiveness in modeling general human motion dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework that unifies representations of human dynamics across different trajectory prediction tasks by projecting motions into a shared embedding space and refining prototype paths using a diffusion model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing SingularTrajectory, a universal trajectory prediction framework that can achieve strong performance across five different trajectory prediction tasks: stochastic, deterministic, momentary observation, domain adaptation, and few-shot learning. The key ideas are:

1) Introducing a Singular space to unify representations of human motion dynamics across different tasks. This space allows projecting input/output trajectories of varying lengths from all tasks into a shared embedding. 

2) Proposing an environment-adaptive anchor in the Singular space to generate prototype trajectory predictions. This anchor leverages scene images to adapt the prototypes to traversable areas.

3) Using a diffusion model to refine the prototype predictions in a cascaded denoising process, resulting in accurate and socially-acceptable predictions. 

The unified framework ensures generalizability across tasks and prediction modalities. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of SingularTrajectory in modeling human motion dynamics for diverse trajectory prediction problems.
