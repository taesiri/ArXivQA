# [CFDNet: A Generalizable Foggy Stereo Matching Network with Contrastive   Feature Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18181)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Stereo matching networks trained on clean images suffer significant performance degradation when tested on foggy images. While some methods have incorporated image dehazing, simply removing fog may not help depth estimation as fog itself provides useful depth cues. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Contrastive Feature Distillation (CFD) framework to enhance model generalization across both clean and foggy conditions. It has two main components:

1) Teacher Model: Adaptively fuses features from clean and foggy images using an attentive feature converter, providing superior features for stereo matching.

2) Student Model: Learns from the teacher via feature distillation incorporated with contrastive learning. This ensures balanced reliance on fog depth hints and clean matching features, preventing over-dependence on either one.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces contrastive feature distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from teacher's fused clean-foggy features to guide student model optimization across domains.

- Proposes an attentive feature converter for adaptive fusion of complementary clean and foggy features in teacher model.

- Implements contrastive learning on student model to maintain balanced emphasis on depth cues from fog vs. clean images after distillation.

- Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate CFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in both foggy and clean conditions. Highlights excellent generalization strength.

In summary, the key innovation is the contrastive feature distillation framework that allows knowledge transfer from teacher's superior cross-domain features to guide student model's balanced optimization for foggy and clean stereo matching. This achieves excellent generalization across conditions.
