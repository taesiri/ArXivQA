# [DreamFlow: High-Quality Text-to-3D Generation by Approximating   Probability Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent works have shown promising results in generating creative 3D content from text prompts by utilizing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. However, existing methods based on score distillation suffer from high variance gradients, requiring lengthy optimization to generate high-quality 3D models. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes DreamFlow, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that approximates the probability flow ODE of diffusion models to enable faster and higher quality 3D optimization. The key ideas are:

(1) Frame text-to-3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem and derive the solution using probability flow ODE.

(2) Match the trajectory of the probability flow ODE to that of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to leverage its rich generative prior. 

(3) Approximate the probability flow ODE and use amortized sampling to update the 3D scene. This results in more stable optimization compared to score distillation.

(4) Propose a 3-stage coarse-to-fine optimization strategy - first optimize NeRF, extract and tune 3D mesh, and refine it using a high-resolution diffusion model.

Main Contributions:

- Propose a new text-to-3D optimization algorithm, Approximate Probability Flow ODE (APFO), that approximates probability flow to enable faster and higher quality 3D generation.

- Design an effective 3-stage coarse-to-fine optimization framework, DreamFlow, that utilizes APFO to generate high quality 3D content from text.

- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to prior arts, while being 5x faster.

- Show the promise of using ideas from diffusion model sampling to improve creative 3D content generation.
