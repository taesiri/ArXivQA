# [Interpreting Grokked Transformers in Complex Modular Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Prior work on grokking has focused on analyzing simple modular addition, but the dynamics and learned representations may differ for more complex modular arithmetic operations like subtraction, multiplication, and polynomials. 
- Understanding these differences is important to gain more insight into real-world applications which have more complex data structures.

Methods & Contributions:
- The paper analyzes grokking dynamics across full modular arithmetic, using Fourier analysis and pre-grokked models (pre-trained on similar tasks) as analysis tools.

Key Findings - Elementary Arithmetic:
- Addition and subtraction learn distinct sparse Fourier representations, while multiplication uses dense cosine-biased representations across all frequencies.  
- Subtraction poses an asymmetry on Transformer, making transfer from addition models fail.
- Despite their differences, co-grokking and coexisting representations are possible when training jointly on multiple operations.

Key Findings - Polynomials:  
- Learned representations exhibit superpositions of elementary arithmetic patterns.
- Factorizability and symmetry determine ease of grokking. Sums of powers and factorizable polynomials (using +/-) grok easily. Non-factorizable polynomials with cross-terms do not.
- Pre-grokked models accelerate grokking for simpler polynomials but not higher degree ones.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of full modular arithmetic - addition, subtraction, multiplication and polynomials
- Identified asymmetry, sparsity and frequency bias in learned representations
- Demonstrated possibility of co-grokking across operations
- Proposed Fourier Frequency Sparsity and Fourier Coefficient Ratio as progress measures for grokking
- Showed factorizability and pre-grokking can accelerate polynomial grokking

The analysis provides significant new insights into differences in dynamics and representations across modular arithmetic tasks, highlighting the need for more holistic analysis.
