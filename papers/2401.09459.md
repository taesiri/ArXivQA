# [What's my role? Modelling responsibility for AI-based safety-critical   systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI-based safety-critical systems (AI-SCS), like autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis tools, are increasingly being deployed in the real world. However, these systems pose challenges around attributing responsibility when things go wrong, due to factors like:
	- Complex development lifecycles with many actors 
	- Unpredictable behavior of black-box AI components 
	- Lack of established standards for developing safe AI
- This makes it hard to hold developers/manufacturers responsible for AI-SCS behavior leading to harm (responsibility gap)
- Instead, human operators often unfairly absorb blame as a "liability sink" for system failures they did not create and may not understand

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a practical modeling and analysis method to capture and clarify different types of responsibility (role, moral, legal, causal) for actors in AI-SCS development and operation
- Uses a core formulation "Actor (A) is responsible for Occurrence (O)" to link actors to tasks, decisions, actions etc.  
- Method has two main phases:
	1) Gather information to build graphical model showing key actors, roles, resources, relationships
	2) Iteratively analyze model to identify issues like conflicts, gaps, overloaded roles  

Main Contributions:
- Extended previous responsibility modeling notations to incorporate multiple responsibility types and provide more clarity
- Demonstrated method on two example case studies: 
	1) Retrospective analysis of 2018 Uber crash
	2) Forwards-looking analysis of AI medical diagnosis tool 
- Showed how modeling can uncover responsibility issues leading to incidents, help demonstrate due diligence, highlight increased burden of risk for operators
- Proposed extensions like richer causal analysis and criteria for determining certain responsibility attributes 

In summary, the paper offers a practical approach to capture and analyze responsibility that provides clarity on risk distribution for AI-SCS, with the goal of preventing unfair blame and using insights to improve safety.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method for modeling and analyzing responsibility relationships between actors in the development and operation of AI-based safety-critical systems, in order to clarify responsibility gaps and prevent unfair blame.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Extending earlier work on responsibility modelling and task analysis to develop a notation and method for modelling role responsibility and role relationships for AI-based safety-critical systems (AI-SCS). This can be used to describe and link actors, occurrences and resources across AI-SCS lifecycle phases.

2. Applying the notation to two different AI-SCS scenarios, showing how the models can illuminate issues (e.g. gaps, conflicts) of responsibility and provide greater clarity on risk distribution and safety impact. The paper particularly focuses on how engineering roles and technical challenges during AI development can lead to burden of risk for operational roles.

3. Proposing an analysis method to review the models for safety impacts. 

4. Demonstrating the utility of the approach with two practical examples - a retrospective analysis of the fatal Uber self-driving car accident, and a predictive role-responsibility analysis for an AI-based diabetes comorbidity prediction system.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and demonstration of a practical method for modelling and analyzing responsibility for the development and operation of AI-based safety-critical systems, in order to clarify responsibility issues and reduce unfair blame.

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- AI-based systems
- Safety
- Responsibility
- Role responsibility 
- Moral responsibility

- Causal responsibility
- Responsibility gaps
- Responsibility modelling
- Safety-critical systems
- Machine learning
- Accountability

- Safety assurance cases

The paper discusses modelling different types of responsibility (role, moral, legal, causal) for AI-based safety-critical systems. It uses responsibility modelling to analyze two case studies - an autonomous vehicle collision and an AI-based medical diagnosis system. The goal is to clarify responsibility to help prevent incidents in the future and avoid unfair blame placed on operators or developers of these AI systems. Key themes include responsibility gaps, burden of risk, safety assurance, accountability, and using modeling to uncover issues early during system development.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes both a notation and a method for modeling responsibility. What are the key elements of the notation and how do they capture the different aspects of responsibility?

2) The method consists of two main phases - gathering information and analyzing the model. What are the key steps in each phase and what types of expertise would be required from the analysts at each step? 

3) The paper argues that analyzing hypothetical failures helps uncover potential issues. How exactly does considering failures allow analysts to identify problems such as conflicts, overloads, and gaps? Can you provide examples from the paper?

4) The Uber case study demonstrates a backwards-looking analysis after an accident has occurred. How does this differ from the forward-looking analysis conducted for the diabetes case study? What are the relative advantages of each?

5) The paper introduces several new concepts and relationships between model elements, such as "uses", "subordinate to", and "acts as". What is the purpose of each and how do they provide additional semantic clarity? 

6) A key part of the analysis is the application of guidewords to model elements. Where have these guidewords been adapted from and why are new guidewords for occurrences proposed instead of using existing ones?

7) The analysis requires assessing the safety impact of issues uncovered. What criteria and considerations should the analysts use to determine severity and priority during this assessment? 

8) The diabetes case study uncovers situations where clinician workload seems likely increased rather than decreased. How could the proposed method be used to quantify and/or highlight such situations where risk is transferred or disproportionately concentrated rather than reduced?

9) Validating the models by comparison with actual incidents is suggested. What other means of validation could be employed if incidents don't occur? How else can the models be refined and improved?

10) How is the proposed modeling and analysis method different from existing responsibility analysis techniques for socio-technical systems? What are some key advantages over previous methods that make this approach well-suited for AI safety-critical systems?
