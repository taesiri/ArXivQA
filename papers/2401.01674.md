# [Transformer RGBT Tracking with Spatio-Temporal Multimodal Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing RGBT trackers either do not utilize temporal information or introduce entire historical frames/templates, which can disrupt original target appearance and cause error accumulation over time. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Transformer RGBT tracking approach that mixes "spatio-temporal multimodal tokens" from static multimodal templates and search regions to handle target appearance changes.  

- Introduce independent "dynamic template tokens" extracted from historical frames to focus on target variations, while retaining involvement of original static template tokens to preserve reliable target information.

- Enhance target features of multimodal template tokens by incorporating cross-modal cues, and make multimodal search region tokens interact with dynamic template tokens to convey target change information.

Main Contributions:

- Propose a "Spatio-Temporal Multimodal Tokens (STMT)" module that incorporates dynamic tokens and cross-modal enhanced tokens to handle target appearance changes, without compromising original target information.

- Extend ViT architecture with proposed STMT module for RGBT tracking and propose temporal sampling strategy for unified training.

- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3 benchmark RGBT datasets while running at real-time speed of 39.1 FPS. Outperform top existing RGBT trackers.

- Effectively address limitations of previous trackers in handling target appearance changes over time while retaining reliability of original target information.

In summary, the key innovation is mixing independent dynamic tokens with static multimodal tokens in Transformer architecture to focus on target changes without disrupting original target information. The proposed approach sets new state-of-the-art on multiple RGBT tracking benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Transformer RGBT tracking approach that mixes spatio-temporal multimodal tokens from static multimodal templates and search regions to handle target appearance changes, while retaining original target information to prevent accumulation of errors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Multimodal Tokens (STMT) module that incorporates independent dynamic tokens from the past as an additional source of information for target appearance changes. This allows the network to focus on target variations without compromising the integrity of the initial target information. The module also utilizes modality-enhanced cues from the original template to facilitate hierarchical modality interactions.

2) It extends the ViT architecture with the proposed STMT module for RGBT tracking. To meet the requirements of temporal training, it proposes a time-sampling training strategy to achieve a unified RGBT tracking network. 

3) Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms on three popular RGBT tracking datasets, while running at a real-time inference speed of 39.1 FPS.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel STMT module that handles target appearance changes by mixing spatio-temporal multimodal tokens, without disrupting the original target appearance information. This improves performance on RGBT tracking.
