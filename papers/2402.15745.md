# [GAOKAO-MM: A Chinese Human-Level Benchmark for Multimodal Models   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal benchmarks focus on primary perception abilities and commonsense knowledge, which are insufficient to comprehensively evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs).
- There is a need for a more human-level benchmark to test LVLMs on a wide range of capabilities including perception, understanding, knowledge and reasoning.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose GAOKAO-MM, a new Chinese multimodal benchmark based on the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO) questions.
- It covers 8 subjects (Chinese, Math, Physics, etc.) and comprises 646 multiple choice questions with 897 images across 12 types. 
- Questions are much longer (4x) than existing benchmarks and require fusing knowledge with visual and textual reasoning to answer correctly.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a human-level, comprehensive Chinese benchmark to evaluate LVLMs.  
- Tests 10 prominent LVLMs and finds accuracy lower than 50% for all, showing considerable room for improvement.
- Provides multi-dimensional analysis showing models still lack abilities in mathematical reasoning, comprehending long text+images, and robustness across different inputs.
- Believes GAOKAO-MM can facilitate development of LVLMs towards artificial general intelligence and their application in education.

In summary, the paper presents GAOKAO-MM, a new challenging Chinese multimodal QA dataset that requires human-level well-rounded capabilities from LVLMs, and shows current models still have significant limitations in skills needed for real-world reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes GAOKAO-MM, a new Chinese multimodal benchmark derived from the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO) that evaluates comprehensive human-level capabilities of large vision-language models, including perception, understanding, knowledge and reasoning across 8 subjects and 12 image types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing GAOKAO-MM, a new Chinese multimodal benchmark for evaluating the comprehensive capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Specifically:

1) GAOKAO-MM is derived from the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO) and comprises 8 subjects and 12 types of images, covering a wide range of knowledge and reasoning skills. 

2) It poses significant challenges for LVLMs in perceiving and understanding images and text, recalling knowledge, and conducting reasoning. Experiments show top LVLMs only achieve less than 50% accuracy on GAOKAO-MM.

3) Analysis reveals gaps in LVLMs' mathematical reasoning, comprehension of long texts and images, and model robustness. GAOKAO-MM provides insights to guide future LVLMs development towards artificial general intelligence.

4) As a native Chinese benchmark focusing on human-level tasks, GAOKAO-MM complements existing English-based benchmarks and facilitates multilingual LVLMs research.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a comprehensive and rigorous Chinese benchmark to evaluate LVLMs' abilities closer to the way humans process multimodal information and make decisions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes GAOKAO-MM as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models. What are some limitations of existing benchmarks that GAOKAO-MM aims to address? How does deriving questions from the GAOKAO help mitigate those limitations?

2. The average question length in GAOKAO-MM is much longer than in other benchmarks. Why is longer context important for properly evaluating vision-language models? What additional capabilities does longer context require? 

3. The paper categorizes model capabilities into perception, understanding, knowledge and reasoning. Can you expand more on the specific sub-skills needed in each of those categories to perform well on GAOKAO-MM?

4. The prompts designed for the experiments emulate a zero-shot setting to mirror human exam conditions. What are the advantages and potential limitations of this evaluation approach?

5. Analysis revealed weaker mathematical reasoning abilities across models. What specific aspects of mathematical reasoning do models struggle with? How might this ability be improved?

6. Models had difficulty comprehending long input texts paired with images. What strategies could be used to improve fine-grained, multimodal understanding over lengthy context?

7. What types of knowledge are required to answer questions in particular GAOKAO-MM subjects like history and politics? How was this knowledge acquired by humans and how can it be encoded in models?

8. The robustness analysis points to output instability across model generations. What factors contribute most to this observation? And how can robustness be improved?

9. The paper focuses evaluation on Chinese language models. What considerations would need to be made to adapt GAOKAO-MM to other languages and multilingual models?

10. Beyond evaluating existing capabilities, what opportunities does GAOKAO-MM create for using models directly in education applications? What other domains could benefit from this approach?
