# [Linear Dynamics-embedded Neural Network for Long-Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing models like RNNs and Transformers have limitations in effectively modeling long sequences due to challenges like vanishing gradients or high computational complexity. 
- Recent SSMs-based models address these issues but have some limitations: based only on SISO SSMs which require feature mixing layers; sensitive initialization and parameters; complex implementations.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a Linear Dynamics Embedded Neural Network (LDNN) based on multi-input multi-output (MIMO) SSMs which have fewer parameters and can directly model multivariate sequences.
- Derives convolutional form of SSMs to enable efficient parallel training. Introduces two strategies:
   - Diagonalization to reduce complexity from O(LN^3) to O(LN)
   - Disentanglement+FFT to reduce convolution complexity from O(L^2NH) to O(LNlogL)
- Parameterizes LDNN to make all parameters optional learnable, with flexible initialization strategies.   
- Introduces bidirectional LDNN and multi-head LDNN variants for broader applications.

Main Contributions:
- Novel LDNN architecture for long sequence modeling based on MIMO SSMs with efficiency and flexibility
- Two strategies to significantly reduce computational complexity and memory requirements
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrating LDNN matches state-of-the-art on LRA benchmark while being simpler to implement than other SSM models

The paper provides an efficient and flexible neural architecture for sequential modeling tasks involving long sequences, with strong empirical evidence for state-of-the-art performance. The integration of concepts from control theory and deep learning is a valuable contribution.
