# [Visual Prompting via Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00647)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can an image inpainting model serve as an effective tool for visual prompting, allowing a model to perform a variety of image-to-image computer vision tasks using only example input-output pairs at test time without any fine-tuning? The key hypothesis is that large-capacity image inpainting models, when trained on the right data, can successfully perform visual prompting for a range of tasks by filling in holes in "visual prompt" images constructed from task examples and query images. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability and analyze what factors contribute to the model's effectiveness at this form of few-shot generalization.In summary, the core research question is whether image inpainting can be used as a simple yet powerful approach to visual prompting, and the key hypothesis is that this is achievable if inpainting models are trained on a dataset designed to teach compositional reasoning over grid-like structures resembling the constructed visual prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and evaluation of a visual prompting method for adapting image inpainting models to new downstream computer vision tasks without any task-specific training. The key ideas are:- Proposing to formulate various computer vision tasks as image inpainting problems by constructing "visual prompts" - grid-like images containing input-output examples and new queries. - Creating a new large dataset of academic paper figures to train image inpainting models. This data better resembles the structure of the visual prompts compared to natural images.- Demonstrating that models trained on this new dataset can effectively perform visual reasoning when prompted at test time with new tasks framed as inpainting. Tasks evaluated include foreground segmentation, object detection, colorization, etc.- Showing the effect of model architecture, training data, and prompt engineering choices on prompting performance. The proposed MAE-VQGAN model trained on the new Figures dataset achieves the best results.In summary, the key contribution is presenting visual prompting as a simple yet effective approach for adapting pretrained image inpainting models to new tasks without any additional training or model modification. This is enabled by training on a large dataset of figures that exposes the model to more complex image structures resembling the visual prompts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the main points in the paper:The paper presents a new dataset called Computer Vision Figures, collected from Arxiv, and shows that image inpainting models trained on this dataset can be visually prompted at test time to perform well on various downstream computer vision tasks using only a few examples, without any fine-tuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in visual prompting and image inpainting:- The idea of using image inpainting models for few-shot visual task prompting is novel. Most prior work on few-shot learning in vision focuses on meta-learning techniques that require some amount of task-specific tuning. This paper shows that image inpainting can serve as a simple yet powerful approach for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks using only example inputs and outputs.- The authors introduce a new dataset called Computer Vision Figures for pretraining inpainting models. This dataset seems unique compared to other image datasets commonly used in vision research (e.g. ImageNet, COCO) in that it contains academic paper figures exhibiting greater compositional structure. Pretraining on this dataset is key to the success of the proposed visual prompting framework.- The MAE-VQGAN model combines ideas from prior work on masked autoencoders (MAE) and vector quantized models (VQGAN). Integrating discrete tokens from VQGAN with MAE appears to be an impactful design choice for visual prompting, compared to just using MAE or VQGAN alone.- The paper demonstrates the generality of their approach by showing promising results on a diverse set of vision tasks including segmentation, detection, colorization etc. The visual prompting setup requires minimal to no task-specific tuning.- Compared to few-shot learning methods, the performance of visual prompting is lower, but the prompting approach is more general and requires less supervision. The limits of visual prompting are also analyzed.Overall, the paper presents a novelconcept for adapting pretrained vision models to new tasks without finetuning, enabled by pretraining on a new dataset tailored for this goal. The results are intriguing but there is room for improvement compared to supervised approaches.
