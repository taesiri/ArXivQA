# [Federated Bayesian Deep Learning: The Application of Statistical   Aggregation Methods to Bayesian Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15263)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Remote sensors are generating huge amounts of data, making centralized training of ML models expensive. Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training without sharing local data. 
- However, most FL research uses deterministic models which lack uncertainty information needed for many applications. Bayesian deep learning (BDL) models provide uncertainty but have not been studied much for FL.
- Simple aggregation methods used in FL for deterministic models are often unsuitable for BDL since they ignore the statistical properties of weight distributions. How to best aggregate BDL models in FL is an open question.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze 6 aggregation strategies for BDL models in FL using IID and non-IID data splits from CIFAR-10 dataset. Strategies include Naive Weighted Averaging (NWA), Weighted Sum (WS), Linear Pooling (LP), Weighted Conflation (WC), Distributed Weight Consolidation (DWC) and conflation.  
- Also analyze Monte Carlo dropout as cheaper alternative to variational inference for BDL.
- Evaluate accuracy, calibration, uncertainty quantification and compute/communication tradeoffs.

Key Contributions:
- Show aggregation method is critical hyperparameter for BDL in FL, impacting accuracy, uncertainty, stability and client costs. 
- Strategies form two groups - WS/WC/conflation perform well with 1 local epoch while NWA/LP need 5 local epochs.
- With model pretraining, DWC performs very well on non-IID data.
- MC dropout is acceptable lightweight alternative to variational inference on IID data but lags on non-IID.
- Provide detailed uncertainty calibration analysis for BDL models in FL setting.
- Open source FL framework to facilitate further research.

In summary, the paper demonstrates aggregating BDL models for FL is non-trivial and analyzes multiple strategies using a rigorous uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology. The insights can inform design of remote sensing systems needing on-device FL with uncertainty information.
