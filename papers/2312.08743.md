# [FAPP: Fast and Adaptive Perception and Planning for UAVs in Dynamic   Cluttered Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08743)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Fast and Adaptive Perception and Planning (FAPP) system to enable UAVs to navigate safely in highly dynamic and cluttered environments. A key innovation is an efficient point cloud segmentation algorithm that distinguishes static and dynamic objects. To address multiple dynamic objects with different motions, an adaptive estimation method with covariance adaptation quickly and accurately predicts their motions. The planning algorithm efficiently optimizes trajectories while considering uncertainty in the predictions. Additionally, an adaptive re-planning strategy handles cases when a collision-free path cannot be found. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environments demonstrate FAPP's ability for real-time perception and planning. The system performs segmentation, tracking, estimation, planning and replanning within 20ms, enabling agile maneuvers among dense, fast-moving obstacles. By advancing UAV autonomy for such complex environments, this work helps pave the way for their safe and reliable deployment in crowded spaces.
