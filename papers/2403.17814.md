# [D-PAD: Deep-Shallow Multi-Frequency Patterns Disentangling for Time   Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17814)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Time series forecasting is crucial but challenging in many real-world applications due to the presence of multiple intricate temporal patterns that are entangled in the data. Existing methods have limitations in effectively disentangling these patterns into components for better analysis and modeling. Specifically, seasonal-trend decomposition methods like Autoformer focus only on few components and ignore other hidden patterns. Frequency domain methods like FEDformer lose details and adaptability. Other deep models using fully-connected layers also fail to separate mixed information across components.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Deep-shallow multi-frequency PAtterns Disentangling neural network (D-PAD) for time series forecasting. D-PAD introduces a Multi-Component Decomposing (MCD) block based on Morphological Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) to decompose the time series into multiple components capturing patterns of different frequency ranges ("shallow" disentanglement). To address information mixing, it uses a Decomposition-Reconstruction-Decomposition (D-R-D) module with guidance from Branch Guidance Generators (BGG) to progressively reconstruct and re-decompose components ("deep" disentanglement), separating mixed frequencies and gathering same frequencies scattered across components from previous MCD. An Interaction and Fusion module further models interactions between frequency components before forecasting.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes MEMD-based MCD blocks for adaptive decomposition into multi-frequency components with high resolution, avoiding limitations of learning-based and frequency domain methods.

- Introduces D-R-D module with guidance from BGG to progressively disentangle mixed frequency patterns and reconstruct useful information, addressing failures of existing deep models. 

- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 7 benchmark datasets, outperforming the best baseline by average 9.48% and 7.15% in MSE and MAE respectively, demonstrating wide applicability.

In summary, the key novelty is the joint "shallow" and "deep" disentanglement of temporal patterns using specifically designed modules, enabling effective modeling of intricate patterns in time series data.
