# [Single Mesh Diffusion Models with Field Latents for Texture Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09250)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel framework for generating high-quality textures on 3D shapes using latent diffusion models. The key contributions are field latents (FLs), a latent representation that encodes textures as vector fields on mesh vertices, and field latent diffusion models (FLDMs), which learn to denoise a diffusion process in the FL space. FLs provide an effective form of perceptual compression that maps textures to discrete vector fields on lower-resolution meshes. FLDMs are built using field convolutions, making them equivariant to isometries of the shape. The authors focus on a single-textured-mesh paradigm where the models are trained to generate variations of a texture on a given mesh. Experiments demonstrate that FLDMs can synthesize textures with higher fidelity than prior single-mesh generative models. An additional benefit of the framework's equivariance is the ability to perform generative texture transfer, where a model trained on one mesh can sample textures when applied to a new, similarly-shaped mesh. Key applications shown are unconditional generation, label-guided synthesis, inpainting, and texture transfer to new topologies.
