# [3D exploration-based search for multiple targets using a UAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) searching for an unknown number of static targets in a 3D environment. The targets are at unknown locations. The UAV is equipped with an imperfect sensor that may miss detecting some targets, and provides noisy measurements of the range, bearing and elevation angles to the targets it detects. The goal is to plan optimal paths for the UAV to find all the targets as quickly as possible, while avoiding obstacles.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a solution composed of four main components:

1. A sequential Monte Carlo probability hypothesis density (SMC-PHD) filter that processes the noisy sensor measurements to update an intensity function representing the expected number of targets in any region of space.  

2. A novel receding horizon path planner that selects the next best UAV positions by maximizing an objective function with two terms:
   - Exploration, to drive the UAV to unseen areas  
   - Target refinement, to better locate potential targets using mutual information (MI) or a cheaper alternative based on summing detection probabilities

3. A method to mark well-localized targets as found and remove the associated measurements, to prevent re-identifying the same targets. 

4. A nonlinear backstepping controller with obstacle avoidance capability to navigate the UAV.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a path planner for a UAV that balances exploration to find new targets with refining existing potential targets, unlike prior work focusing only on refinement

- Defines the framework for the full problem of multi-target search by a UAV in 3D space including sensing, estimation, planning and control  

- Presents extensive simulation studies analyzing different algorithm design choices

- Validates the approach with real-world experiments using a Parrot Mambo drone searching for markers on the ground and avoiding obstacles

The main novelty lies in the receding horizon path planner that drives the UAV to completely explore the environment unlike traditional lawn-mower trajectories, while also refining uncertain measurements. This enables efficiently finding an unknown number of targets.
