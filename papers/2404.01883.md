# [Adversarial Combinatorial Bandits with Switching Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01883)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper studies the problem of adversarial combinatorial bandits with switching costs. In this problem, there are K base arms that can be combined into different combinatorial arms, each consisting of I base arms. The losses of the base arms are arbitrarily generated by an adversary. In each round, the player selects a combinatorial arm and incurs the total loss of the selected base arms as well as a switching cost lambda for each base arm that is changed from the previous round. The goal is to design algorithms with small regret, defined as the difference between the total loss of the algorithm and that of the best fixed combinatorial arm in hindsight. 

Key Challenges
The key challenges are:
1) Handling the combinatorial arm set instead of individual arms
2) Accounting for the switching costs in the regret
3) Deriving algorithms and bounds for both bandit (only total loss observed) and semi-bandit (losses of each arm observed) feedback

Main Contributions
1) Derived lower bounds on the minimax regret for both bandit and semi-bandit feedback settings. The bounds are Ω((\lambda K)^{1/3} (TI)^{2/3}) and Ω((\lambda KI)^{1/3} T^{2/3}) respectively.

2) Proposed Batch-Exp2 algorithm for bandit feedback, achieving an upper bound of O((\lambda K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} I^{4/3}) on the regret.

3) Proposed Batch-BROAD algorithm for semi-bandit feedback, achieving an upper bound of Õ((\lambda K)^{1/3}(TI)^{2/3}) on the regret. 

The algorithms operate in batches, restricting the number of switches. The upper and lower bounds match in their dependence on λ, K and T, differing only in their dependence on the combinatorial arm size I.
