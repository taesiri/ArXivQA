# [Weak localization in radiative transfer of acoustic waves in a   randomly-fluctuating slab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0822)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper focuses on deriving radiative transfer equations for acoustic waves propagating through a randomly fluctuating slab, and studying boundary effects on the wave transport using the Wigner transform. The central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Can radiative transfer equations be derived to model acoustic wave propagation and energy transport in a slab geometry with random fluctuations, similar to existing models for unbounded or half-space domains?2. How do the slab boundaries impact the transport of wave energy density compared to an unbounded domain, both near the boundaries and inside the slab? 3. In particular, does the slab geometry lead to additional interference effects between waves reflecting off the boundaries that impact the coherent and/or incoherent parts of the energy density?The authors use an asymptotic analysis of the Wigner transform solution to the wave equation to derive radiative transfer equations for the slab geometry. They show boundary effects lead to interference and amplification of the energy density near the slab surfaces and specific planes inside the slab. The interference only impacts the coherent part of the energy density inside the slab, which the authors relate to weak localization effects. Overall, the paper aims to extend radiative transfer modeling and understand wave interference/localization effects in bounded slab geometries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. It derives radiative transfer equations to model the transport of acoustic wave energy density in a randomly fluctuating slab geometry, bounded by two parallel planes. This extends prior work on radiative transfer in unbounded or half-space domains.2. It uses the method of images and Wigner transform techniques to study boundary effects on the wave propagation. Two main types of boundary effects are analyzed:- Intensity enhancement within one wavelength of the slab boundaries, impacting the total (coherent + incoherent) energy density. This is similar to prior results for a half-space. - Weak localization and constructive interference of the coherent energy within one wavelength of two specific planes inside the slab (dashed lines in Fig. 1). This is unique to the slab geometry with two bounding surfaces.3. It discusses how the boundary effects differ for Neumann, Dirichlet, and mixed boundary conditions at the interfaces. For example, Neumann conditions lead to doubling of energy at boundaries while Dirichlet leads to cancelation.4. The approach connects radiative transfer to periodic media and interference effects, while retaining a slab thickness much larger than the wavelength. This contrasts prior periodic media results where the period was comparable to the wavelength.In summary, the key contributions are extending radiative transfer theory to acoustic slab geometries, rigorously analyzing the boundary and interference effects using Wigner transforms, and discussing the influence of boundary conditions. The results help build understanding of wave propagation and energy transport in bounded random media.
