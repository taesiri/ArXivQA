# [Advancing GenAI Assisted Programming--A Comparative Study on Prompt   Efficiency and Code Quality Between GPT-4 and GLM-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores best practices for utilizing generative AI (GenAI) as a programming tool, through a comparative analysis of GPT-4 and GLM-4 on their efficiency and quality of code generation. With the rapid advancement of GenAI capabilities, establishing effective operational norms to maximize benefits and mitigate risks is crucial but lacking in current literature.  

Proposed Solution  
The authors design a structured methodology to evaluate GenAI-assisted coding, using prompts of varying complexity to generate a Snake game module. They assess success rates, debugging efficiency, code conciseness/readability, and functionality completeness as key criteria. The paper also examines the impact of a "confirmation round" prompt on one-shot success rates.

Key Findings
Simplest prompts like "generate Snake game code" yield highest 90% one-shot success for both GPT-4 and GLM-4. Adding a confirmation round further boosts success rate. GPT-4 slightly outperforms GLM-4 overall but difference is minimal. Authors demonstrate a 30-100x efficiency gain with GenAI coding over traditional methods.

Contributions  
The study contributes (1) a systematic framework to evaluate GenAI coding capabilities and code quality, (2) guidelines for effective prompt design, (3) analysis of coding efficiency improvements, (4) demonstration of real-world applicability via a GenAI workshop. It sets the stage for new programming paradigms where developers guide GenAI tools to boost productivity and innovation.

In summary, the paper presents a robust methodology to establish operational norms for GenAI-assisted programming through comparative assessment. It offers key insights on maximizing efficiency and code quality when utilizing GenAI for software development.
