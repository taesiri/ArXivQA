# [SPACE: Speech-driven Portrait Animation with Controllable Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09809)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a method to generate high-quality, controllable, speech-driven portrait animations from a single image?

The key goals and hypotheses appear to be:

- Speech-driven facial animation from a single image can produce high visual quality results on par with or better than video-driven approaches. 

- Using both explicit facial landmarks and learned latent keypoints as intermediate representations allows combining controllability with strong image synthesis ability.

- A multi-stage approach going from speech to landmarks to latents to image generation enables control over facial expressions, poses, emotions, etc.

- Conditioning the intermediate landmark and latent keypoint predictions on emotion labels allows control over emotion type and intensity in the final output.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a multi-stage approach utilizing both explicit and latent facial representations can achieve high-quality and highly controllable speech-driven facial animation from just a single input image. The experiments aim to validate the visual quality, controllability, and benefits of the proposed approach compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting SPACE, a method for high-quality speech-driven portrait animation with controllable expression. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Uses a multi-stage approach utilizing both explicit facial landmarks and latent keypoints from a pretrained face image generator. This allows leveraging the benefits of both - interpretability of landmarks and high quality synthesis from latent keypoints.

- Achieves state-of-the-art image quality and facial motion accuracy compared to prior speech animation methods. Also generates high resolution 512x512 output videos.

- Allows control over head pose by using either provided pose inputs or predicted poses. Facial landmarks allow control over gaze, blinking, etc.

- Introduces emotion conditioning to manipulate emotion types and intensities in the generated videos.

- The interpretable representations allow creative editing and control while leveraging a strong pretrained face generator results in photorealistic animation from just speech and a single photo.

In summary, the main contribution is a high-quality speech-driven facial animation framework with fine-grained control over expressions, motions, and emotions. It combines explicit and latent representations for creative control and photorealism.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents SPACE, a speech-driven portrait animation method that produces realistic and high-resolution videos with controllable pose, facial landmark motions, and expressions by predicting sequences of normalized landmarks and latent face keypoints from audio.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on speech-driven portrait animation:

- The paper presents a new method called SPACE for animating a still portrait image using just speech audio. This is an active area of research with several recent papers, but SPACE offers stronger controllability and higher output quality compared to prior work. 

- A key novelty of SPACE is using both facial landmarks and latent keypoints as intermediate representations when mapping speech to facial motions. This allows leveraging the benefits of both - controllability of landmarks and better motion transfer/quality from latent features. Most prior works use just one of these representations.

- SPACE enables control over pose, emotions, and expression intensities in the output video. This level of control is unique compared to other portrait animation methods that are mainly focused on lip sync. 

- The paper compares SPACE against recent state-of-the-art methods like Wav2Lip, MakeItTalk, and PC-AVS. Evaluations show SPACE achieves better photorealism with lower FID scores and is strongly preferred by users.

- The resolution of 512x512 for output videos from SPACE is higher than prior works like Wav2Lip (96x96), MakeItTalk (256x256), and PC-AVS (224x224).

- SPACE is person-agnostic and does not require model tuning per subject like some prior portrait animation works. The same model can be used across different input images.

- For emotion control, SPACE takes a different approach compared to MEAD and EAMM by using simple conditioning instead of disentangling speech content and style. But SPACE still allows controlling emotion types and intensities.

Overall, SPACE pushes the state-of-the-art in controllability, quality, and resolution for speech-driven facial animation compared to related works, while also being easy to deploy for new users without per-subject tuning. The novel design choices and extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantages over prior arts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several directions for future research:

- Improving the ability to model long range temporal dependencies in the audio. The current approach uses short temporal convolutions in the audio encoder which limit the effective receptive field. Using transformers or other architectures better at modeling long range dependencies could help improve quality.

- Extending the method to model full body motion and gestures, not just facial expressions. The current method focuses only on animating the face region. 

- Enhancing controllability over gaze, blinks, and other fine facial motions. The landmarks provide some control over these but there is room for improvement.

- Disentangling speech content from emotion and intensity. The current approach relies on weak disentanglement from the unidirectional audio encoder. Explicit disentanglement could allow for better control.

- Exploring different conditional generation methods like GANs instead of direct regression. Adversarial training may produce sharper and more detailed outputs.

- Improving identity preservation, especially for large motions. There can still be distortions for large out-of-plane rotations.

- Evaluating on a more diverse test set covering more poses, accents, languages, etc. The current test set has limitations in diversity.

In summary, the main future directions are improving long-range temporal modeling, full body and gesture generation, enhancing control over fine details, stronger speech/emotion disentanglement, exploring GANs, identity preservation, and more comprehensive evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents SPACE (Speech-driven Portrait Animation with Controllable Expression), a method for animating a still portrait image using only an input speech signal. The key idea is to decompose the problem into multiple stages - first predicting facial landmark motions from speech, then transforming the landmarks into latent keypoints used by a pretrained high-resolution face generator. This allows controllability via the landmark space while leveraging the image quality of a pretrained generator. The method consists of three main stages: 1) Speech2Landmarks: an LSTM predicts normalized facial landmarks from input speech and image landmarks. 2) Landmarks2Latents: the posed landmarks are converted to latent keypoints for the face generator. 3) Video synthesis: the pretrained generator outputs a 512x512 video using the predicted latent keypoints. The intermediate landmark predictions allow control over facial features like blinking. The method also enables control over pose and emotion type/intensity. Experiments show the approach produces high-quality outputs and outperforms prior speech-driven talking head methods in quantitative metrics and user studies. Key advantages are the pose and emotion controllability, while leveraging a pretrained generator for high-resolution outputs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents SPACE, a method for animating portrait images using speech audio as input. The key idea is to break down the task into multiple stages - first predicting facial landmarks from audio, then transforming them into latent keypoints used by a pretrained face image generator, and finally synthesizing a high resolution video. A key advantage of this approach is it allows control over various aspects like facial expressions, head pose, blinking etc. by manipulating the intermediate representations of landmarks and latent keypoints. 

SPACE uses a LSTM network to predict normalized 3D facial landmarks from input speech features. These landmarks can be edited to add effects like blinking before applying the desired head pose. The posed landmarks are fed to another network to generate corresponding latent keypoints used by the face image generator network. This generator can produce 512x512 output frames with photorealistic quality by warping the input image. The whole framework is trained on a cleaned subset of VoxCeleb, Ryerson and MEAD datasets. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SPACE in terms of output quality, facial motion accuracy and human evaluations compared to previous speech driven face animation methods. The controllable intermediate stages also enable novel applications like video conferencing using just audio.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method called SPACE for speech-driven portrait animation with controllable expression. The key ideas are:

1) The method takes a single portrait image and speech audio as input. It generates an animated talking head video with controllable expression as output. 

2) The animation is generated in multiple stages: First, given the input speech, facial landmarks are predicted in a normalized space to represent mouth and face motions. Then, the desired head pose is applied to the landmarks. The landmarks are transformed into latent keypoints that are inputs to a pretrained high-quality face generator network. Finally, the generator network produces a video with the identity of the input image, motions from the predicted landmarks and latent keypoints, and desired pose.

3) Facial landmarks allow control over blinking, gaze, etc. Latent keypoints enable better motion transfer and image quality. Using both together gives controllability and high visual quality. The pretrained generator enables 512x512 output.

4) Conditioning on emotion labels and intensities during training allows control over emotion types and intensities at test time. FiLM layers are used to condition the predictions.

5) Both video-predicted and audio-predicted poses are supported. This allows pose generation or transfer from other videos.

In summary, the method decomposes speech-driven facial animation into landmark prediction, pose handling, and high-quality synthesis stages. The novel strategies of using both explicit and latent keypoints, along with emotion conditioning, enable state-of-the-art controllability over pose, expressions, and visual quality.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the authors are addressing the problem of animating portraits using speech. In particular, they aim to generate high-quality videos with realistic facial expressions, head motions, and lip sync from an input speech signal and a single image. 

Some key challenges they identify in speech-driven portrait animation include:

- Mapping speech to nuanced facial motions and expressions is inherently ambiguous (one-to-many).

- Generating natural motions and high image quality is difficult. 

- Allowing control over aspects like emotions, head poses, gaze, etc. is important for applications but lacking in prior works.

To address these issues, the paper presents SPACE - a method for Speech-driven Portrait Animation with Controllable Expression. The goal is to achieve state-of-the-art realism and resolution while also enabling control over emotions, facial landmarks, and head poses in a single framework.
