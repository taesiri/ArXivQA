# [SPACE: Speech-driven Portrait Animation with Controllable Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09809)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a method to generate high-quality, controllable, speech-driven portrait animations from a single image?

The key goals and hypotheses appear to be:

- Speech-driven facial animation from a single image can produce high visual quality results on par with or better than video-driven approaches. 

- Using both explicit facial landmarks and learned latent keypoints as intermediate representations allows combining controllability with strong image synthesis ability.

- A multi-stage approach going from speech to landmarks to latents to image generation enables control over facial expressions, poses, emotions, etc.

- Conditioning the intermediate landmark and latent keypoint predictions on emotion labels allows control over emotion type and intensity in the final output.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a multi-stage approach utilizing both explicit and latent facial representations can achieve high-quality and highly controllable speech-driven facial animation from just a single input image. The experiments aim to validate the visual quality, controllability, and benefits of the proposed approach compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting SPACE, a method for high-quality speech-driven portrait animation with controllable expression. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Uses a multi-stage approach utilizing both explicit facial landmarks and latent keypoints from a pretrained face image generator. This allows leveraging the benefits of both - interpretability of landmarks and high quality synthesis from latent keypoints.

- Achieves state-of-the-art image quality and facial motion accuracy compared to prior speech animation methods. Also generates high resolution 512x512 output videos.

- Allows control over head pose by using either provided pose inputs or predicted poses. Facial landmarks allow control over gaze, blinking, etc.

- Introduces emotion conditioning to manipulate emotion types and intensities in the generated videos.

- The interpretable representations allow creative editing and control while leveraging a strong pretrained face generator results in photorealistic animation from just speech and a single photo.

In summary, the main contribution is a high-quality speech-driven facial animation framework with fine-grained control over expressions, motions, and emotions. It combines explicit and latent representations for creative control and photorealism.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents SPACE, a speech-driven portrait animation method that produces realistic and high-resolution videos with controllable pose, facial landmark motions, and expressions by predicting sequences of normalized landmarks and latent face keypoints from audio.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on speech-driven portrait animation:

- The paper presents a new method called SPACE for animating a still portrait image using just speech audio. This is an active area of research with several recent papers, but SPACE offers stronger controllability and higher output quality compared to prior work. 

- A key novelty of SPACE is using both facial landmarks and latent keypoints as intermediate representations when mapping speech to facial motions. This allows leveraging the benefits of both - controllability of landmarks and better motion transfer/quality from latent features. Most prior works use just one of these representations.

- SPACE enables control over pose, emotions, and expression intensities in the output video. This level of control is unique compared to other portrait animation methods that are mainly focused on lip sync. 

- The paper compares SPACE against recent state-of-the-art methods like Wav2Lip, MakeItTalk, and PC-AVS. Evaluations show SPACE achieves better photorealism with lower FID scores and is strongly preferred by users.

- The resolution of 512x512 for output videos from SPACE is higher than prior works like Wav2Lip (96x96), MakeItTalk (256x256), and PC-AVS (224x224).

- SPACE is person-agnostic and does not require model tuning per subject like some prior portrait animation works. The same model can be used across different input images.

- For emotion control, SPACE takes a different approach compared to MEAD and EAMM by using simple conditioning instead of disentangling speech content and style. But SPACE still allows controlling emotion types and intensities.

Overall, SPACE pushes the state-of-the-art in controllability, quality, and resolution for speech-driven facial animation compared to related works, while also being easy to deploy for new users without per-subject tuning. The novel design choices and extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantages over prior arts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several directions for future research:

- Improving the ability to model long range temporal dependencies in the audio. The current approach uses short temporal convolutions in the audio encoder which limit the effective receptive field. Using transformers or other architectures better at modeling long range dependencies could help improve quality.

- Extending the method to model full body motion and gestures, not just facial expressions. The current method focuses only on animating the face region. 

- Enhancing controllability over gaze, blinks, and other fine facial motions. The landmarks provide some control over these but there is room for improvement.

- Disentangling speech content from emotion and intensity. The current approach relies on weak disentanglement from the unidirectional audio encoder. Explicit disentanglement could allow for better control.

- Exploring different conditional generation methods like GANs instead of direct regression. Adversarial training may produce sharper and more detailed outputs.

- Improving identity preservation, especially for large motions. There can still be distortions for large out-of-plane rotations.

- Evaluating on a more diverse test set covering more poses, accents, languages, etc. The current test set has limitations in diversity.

In summary, the main future directions are improving long-range temporal modeling, full body and gesture generation, enhancing control over fine details, stronger speech/emotion disentanglement, exploring GANs, identity preservation, and more comprehensive evaluation.
