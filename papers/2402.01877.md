# [Mobile Fitting Room: On-device Virtual Try-on via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01877)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Virtual try-on aims to provide an interactive experience for users to virtually try on clothes before purchasing, similar to an in-store fitting room. However, traditional virtual try-on methods using image warping struggle with complex poses and backgrounds. Recent diffusion models can generate higher quality try-on images but do not consider the human-centered mobile interface delivery and privacy concerns. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes the first on-device diffusion-based virtual try-on system called Mobile Fitting Room. The system allows privacy-preserving and personalized virtual try-on experiences on mobile devices. The technical contributions include:

1) A novel pipeline for efficient on-device try-on models, including fine-tuning a diffusion model to control garment placement, compressing the model to meet mobile resource constraints, and utilizing inpainting for user personalization.

2) A mobile application with three components: Garments Window for garment selection, Personalization Window for user image upload and region masking, and Result Page showing the generated image. The interface allows interactivity and customization.

3) A usage scenario from business and user perspectives, highlighting privacy protection, customization, and improved customer experience.

Key outcomes:
The system is the first to enable on-device diffusion-based virtual try-on with controllable garment placement and user personalization. This preserves privacy while providing an interactive mobile experience for fashion e-commerce.

Planned future work includes model improvements for fidelity and generalizability, a two-stage user study for evaluating usability, and deployment on the App Store.
