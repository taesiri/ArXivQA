# [HoughToRadon Transform: New Neural Network Layer for Features   Improvement in Projection Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have limitations in processing all pixels equally regardless of importance, relying on pre-trained filters that may not apply, and difficulty modeling long-range spatial relationships. This leads to inefficiency.
- Using Hough Transform (HT) as a layer expands feature map sizes considerably, increasing computation costs for subsequent convolutions.  
- HT space coordinates (s,t) have a non-linear relationship to line angle and shift parameters, which is problematic for convolutions.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a new HoughToRadon Transform (HRT) layer to convert HT space (s,t) to Radon space (ρ,φ) which has a linear relationship between coordinates and line parameters.
- HRT has parameters n and scaleX to adjust output image size, allowing a tradeoff between quality and computation cost.
- Placing HRT after HT reduces the size of intermediate feature maps input to subsequent convolutions, reducing computation.

Contributions:
- HRT converts between HT and Radon spaces, enabling linearity by line angle/shift for convolutions and feature map size adjustment.  
- Implementing HRT in a CNN with HT reduces computation costs of convolutions by up to 97% without loss of accuracy.
- With HRT, accuracy on document segmentation improves from 96% to 97.7%, achieving state-of-the-art on the MIDV-500 dataset. 
- Balancing n and scaleX allows flexible optimization of computation cost versus quality.

In summary, the paper introduces HoughToRadon transform to improve efficiency alongside accuracy for CNNs using Hough transform by adjusting feature map sizes and enabling linear convolutions.
