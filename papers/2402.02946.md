# [HoughToRadon Transform: New Neural Network Layer for Features   Improvement in Projection Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have limitations in processing all pixels equally regardless of importance, relying on pre-trained filters that may not apply, and difficulty modeling long-range spatial relationships. This leads to inefficiency.
- Using Hough Transform (HT) as a layer expands feature map sizes considerably, increasing computation costs for subsequent convolutions.  
- HT space coordinates (s,t) have a non-linear relationship to line angle and shift parameters, which is problematic for convolutions.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a new HoughToRadon Transform (HRT) layer to convert HT space (s,t) to Radon space (ρ,φ) which has a linear relationship between coordinates and line parameters.
- HRT has parameters n and scaleX to adjust output image size, allowing a tradeoff between quality and computation cost.
- Placing HRT after HT reduces the size of intermediate feature maps input to subsequent convolutions, reducing computation.

Contributions:
- HRT converts between HT and Radon spaces, enabling linearity by line angle/shift for convolutions and feature map size adjustment.  
- Implementing HRT in a CNN with HT reduces computation costs of convolutions by up to 97% without loss of accuracy.
- With HRT, accuracy on document segmentation improves from 96% to 97.7%, achieving state-of-the-art on the MIDV-500 dataset. 
- Balancing n and scaleX allows flexible optimization of computation cost versus quality.

In summary, the paper introduces HoughToRadon transform to improve efficiency alongside accuracy for CNNs using Hough transform by adjusting feature map sizes and enabling linear convolutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new HoughToRadon Transform layer to improve neural networks using Hough Transforms for image segmentation by reducing computation costs and feature map sizes while enhancing performance and achieving state-of-the-art 97.7% accuracy on a document dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new neural network layer called the HoughToRadon Transform (HRT) layer. Here are the key points about the HRT layer and its contributions:

- The HRT layer transforms the coordinates of feature maps from (s,t) space to (ρ,φ) space after a Hough Transform layer in a neural network. Its inverse, RadonToHough Transform (RHT), transforms the coordinates back for gradient propagation during training.

- Adding the HRT and RHT layers allows using smaller intermediate feature maps after the Hough Transform layer, reducing computation time and memory requirements of subsequent convolutional layers.

- The paper shows that adding HRT enables using a scaled down version of the Hough Transform output without compromising accuracy. In experiments using the HoughEncoder architecture for document segmentation, adding HRT achieved 97.7% MIoU accuracy while reducing computations by up to 97% compared to the base HoughEncoder model.

- The linearity of (ρ,φ) coordinates allows convolutional filters to operate more efficiently on the transformed feature maps compared to the non-linear (s,t) space.

- Overall, the HRT layer provides an effective way to leverage the representational benefits of Hough Transform layers in neural networks while overcoming associated disadvantages like increased feature map sizes. It improves speed and efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
