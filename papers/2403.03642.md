# [Generative Active Learning with Variational Autoencoder for Radiology   Data Generation in Veterinary Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03642)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for veterinary medicine has been hindered by the lack of sufficient radiology data. Generating synthetic medical images using generative models like GANs has shown promise, but still faces challenges in producing high-quality and realistic images.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a generative active learning framework based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) to alleviate data scarcity for veterinary CAD systems. The key ideas are:

1) Preprocess the raw images by removing annotations, inpainting masked areas and standardizing image resolutions. 

2) Use a ProjectedGAN model to generate new images. Iteratively evaluate the model and save the best performing weights. Add the top 10% most realistic generated images to the training set, as judged by VAE-based cosine similarity scores.  

3) Demonstrate usefulness of generated images by training a YOLOv8 classifier on original + generated cardiomegaly data and evaluating performance.

Main Contributions:

- Novel framework combining GAN-based image generation with VAE-based active learning query strategy to improve image quality and augmentation.

- Preprocessing pipeline to remove annotations and standardize medical images.

- Experimental validation on veterinary radiographs showing reduced Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) of generative model from 84.14 to 50.75 across cycles.

- Classification experiments indicate generated images are useful - false positive rate of confusion matrix improved from 0.16 to 0.66.

- Addresses key challenge of data scarcity in developing veterinary CAD systems. Framework is potentially applicable to other medical imaging modalities.

In summary, the proposed VAE-based active learning approach for improving generative models shows promise in addressing data scarcity for veterinary CAD system development.
