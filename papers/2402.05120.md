# [More Agents Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05120)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have shown improvements by using model ensembles or multi-agent collaboration frameworks, indicating potential gains from using multiple agents. However, there has been no dedicated study on the scaling properties and performance gains simply from using more LLM agents. 

Method:
- The paper proposes a simple "sampling-and-voting" method to scale up the number of LLM agents. Queries are fed into the LLM multiple times to get multiple outputs. Majority voting is used to select the final output.

Key Findings:
- Performance generally improves by increasing the number of agents across diverse LLMs and tasks. A smaller 13B model with enough agents can outperform a larger 70B model. 

- The method combines well with other techniques like prompt engineering and multi-agent collaboration, providing further gains. It achieves the best overall performance compared to more complex methods.

- The degree of improvement correlates with task difficulty. Analysis of different dimensions of difficulty (inherent, steps required, prior probability) reveals properties related to where the method is most effective.

Main Contributions:  
- First comprehensive study showing LLM performance scales up with number of agents using a simple sampling & voting approach.

- Demonstrates orthogonality and compatibility with other LLM performance improvement techniques.

- Analysis of how task difficulty dimensions impact the effectiveness of the approach, and strategies to further boost gains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a simple sampling-and-voting method to improve language model performance by increasing the number of model instances, and shows this approach is compatible with other techniques while being most effective on more difficult tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting the first systematic study on the scaling property of raw agents instantiated by large language models (LLMs). The paper finds that performance scales with the increase of agents, using a simple sampling and voting method.

2. Exploring the compatibility of the proposed method with existing complicated methods that stimulate the potential of LLMs. The paper shows the proposed method can enhance these existing methods to achieve further performance improvements. 

3. Analyzing the effectiveness of the proposed method in tackling problems at varying difficulties and then distilling the properties behind this. Based on the analyzed properties, the paper proposes further optimization methods that can facilitate the occurrence of the finding that more agents lead to better performance.

In summary, the main contribution is conducting a comprehensive study to show that simply adding more LLM agents, through a simple sampling and voting approach, can improve LLM performance across a variety of tasks. The paper also analyzes when and why this occurs and how to further optimize this approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a simple sampling-and-voting method to improve LLM performance by increasing the number of agents. How does this method compare to more complex methods like chain-of-thought prompting or debate frameworks in terms of implementation complexity? Does the simplicity come at the cost of flexibility or extensibility?

2. The method shows strong performance gains on reasoning tasks but more modest gains on generative tasks. What factors inherent in these two types of tasks might account for this difference? How could the method be adapted to further improve performance on generative tasks?  

3. The paper shows how performance gains correlate with task difficulty along three key dimensions. For real-world applications, how could these dimensions be estimated to determine when this method will be most beneficial? What other factors related to task difficulty might also influence the efficacy of this approach?

4. The hierarchical sampling-and-voting extension leverages models of different scales on sub-problems of varying difficulty. In practice, how can the boundaries between sub-problem difficulties be determined? How sensitive are performance gains to the partitioning of sub-problems?  

5. The paper focuses on intra-model ensembling. Could the method be extended for inter-model ensembling? What challenges would need to be addressed in terms of sampling consistency and voting mechanisms across different model architectures and modalities?

6. The method relies on majority voting to select the final response. For cases without a clear majority, what alternative voting or selection mechanisms could be used? How could confidence scores be incorporated into the voting process?

7. Response diversity is needed for the voting process to work effectively. What prompts or decoding strategies could further increase diversity among the sampled responses beyond temperature and nucleus sampling? 

8. The paper analyzes how various dimensions of task difficulty impact performance gains, but does not optimize sampling or voting based on these insights. How could the method adaptively adjust hyperparameters like sample size or voting thresholds based on estimated task difficulty?

9. The method improves sample quality through consensus, but discards the context behind deviating responses. Could insights be extracted from analyzing inconsistent responses using clustering or other unsupervised approaches? 

10. The method becomes costly with large sample sizes due to sequential querying. Could efficiency be improved by distilling the ensemble into a single model? What challenges exist in replicating consensus-based gains within a single model?
