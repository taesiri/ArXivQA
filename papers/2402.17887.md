# [JMLR: Joint Medical LLM and Retrieval Training for Enhancing Reasoning   and Professional Question Answering Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have great potential for advancing healthcare through improved medical knowledge acquisition and question answering. However, they face challenges with hallucination - generating plausible but incorrect/unverified information. This poses serious risks for healthcare applications which require precision and reliability. 

- Existing retrieval augmented methods alleviate hallucination by retrieving validated documents to provide contextual grounding for LLMs. But limitations remain around domain-specific retrieval performance and ineffective blending of the LLM's internal knowledge with external retrieved information.

Method: 
- The paper proposes Joint Medical LLM and Retrieval Training (JMLR) which synchronizes training of the LLM and retriever, overcoming limitations of traditional separate training.

- A unique LLM-Rank loss trains the retriever to prioritize documents that significantly aid the LLM's performance. This aligns the capabilities of both components.

- Direct fine-tuning on target datasets is used rather than conventional pretraining-finetuning which is more computationally expensive. This efficiently expands medical knowledge.

Contributions:
- JMLR outperforms state-of-the-art models like Meditron-70B and ChatGPT in medical question answering benchmarks, proving effectiveness.

- Reduces training time from 144 hours (conventional method) to just 37 hours, demonstrating efficiency.

- Provides enhanced reasoning capabilities and explainability judged positively by both GPT-4 and medical professionals, highlighting reliability.

- Overall, demonstrates successfully integrating retrieval into LLM training to boost performance on knowledge-intensive medical tasks while using resources judiciously.
