# [Diffusion Language Models Can Perform Many Tasks with Scaling and   Instruction-Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12219)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can diffusion language models effectively scale up to perform well across diverse language tasks through pretraining, enlarging model sizes, and instruction tuning?

In particular, the paper investigates whether diffusion language models can:

1) Acquire general knowledge from large-scale pretraining, similar to masked language models like BERT.

2) Improve performance on downstream tasks as model size increases, following the typical scaling laws of language models. 

3) Exhibit strong zero-shot and few-shot performance on new tasks when adapted through instruction tuning, like GPT-3.

The overall goal is to explore whether diffusion language models can match or exceed the capabilities of autoregressive language models by leveraging scaling techniques like pretraining, model enlargement, and instruction tuning. The paper aims to demonstrate the viability of diffusion models as a powerful alternative paradigm for generative language modeling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Demonstrating that diffusion language models can be scaled effectively to improve performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. The authors show this by pretraining diffusion models on large unlabeled corpora, scaling up model sizes, and adapting them to downstream tasks via task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning. 

2. Highlighting the potential of diffusion models as an alternative to autoregressive models for generative language modeling. The paper argues that diffusion models have several theoretical advantages, such as a global receptive field and non-autoregressive generation. The experiments aim to substantiate these claims empirically.

3. Providing analysis and findings regarding the abilities of scaled diffusion models:

- They can acquire knowledge from large-scale pretraining and improve with greater model capacity, following scaling laws similar to autoregressive models. 

- They exhibit zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities when adapted via instruction finetuning, allowing them to perform unseen tasks by following natural language instructions.

- They demonstrate some promising structured reasoning behaviors thanks to flexible generation ordering, but still struggle with complex reasoning tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that with proper scaling and adaptation, diffusion models can serve as strong generative language learners comparable to autoregressive models, across a diverse range of tasks. The paper aims to demonstrate the promise of scaling up this alternative paradigm.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper demonstrates that scaling up diffusion language models in terms of data, model size, and tasks leads to improved performance across a variety of language tasks, and instruction tuning can further elicit zero-shot and few-shot abilities, though reasoning tasks remain challenging.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on scaling up diffusion language models in terms of data, model size, and tasks. Other recent work has also explored scaling laws and capabilities of large language models, but primarily focused on autoregressive models like GPT-3. This paper provides novel empirical analysis on the scalability of diffusion models.

- The paper shows that pretraining and scaling up diffusion models leads to improved performance on downstream NLP tasks. This aligns with findings on scaling laws for autoregressive models, suggesting diffusion models exhibit similar trends.

This resonates with other recent studies showing reasoning remains challenging for large models without more specialized training.

- Overall, this paper significantly advances understanding of diffusion language models. The comprehensive analysis on scaling these models parallels key findings from the autoregressive model literature, highlighting diffusion models as a promising alternative architecture. The paper also reveals open challenges like reasoning that warrant further research.

In summary, this paper provides novel scaling studies on an alternative generative modeling approach that is underexplored compared to autoregressive models. The empirical findings align with and complement related work on scaling laws, few-shot learning, and reasoning in large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Pretraining diffusion language models from scratch with improved model architectures and pretraining recipes, rather than just adapting existing masked language models. This could help improve performance and reasoning abilities.

- Specializing smaller diffusion language models for particular reasoning tasks by distilling knowledge from larger, more capable models. This could help elicit stronger reasoning skills in smaller models.

- Incorporating process supervision using causal graphs to help guide the models' generation order and conform better to topological sorts during reasoning tasks. This could improve structured reasoning abilities. 

- Exploring different schedule strategies during training and sampling to better conform with topological sorts. This could also enhance reasoning performance.

- Scaling up model sizes even further to determine if reasoning skills continue to improve and when they may reach human levels.

- Testing diffusion language models on a wider variety of complex reasoning tasks to better understand their capabilities and limitations.

- Comparing diffusion language models to autoregressive models on advanced language tasks to determine their relative strengths and weaknesses.

- Improving arithmetic skills through better model architectures and pretraining data.

- Testing the limits of instruction tuning by expanding the diversity and complexity of included tasks.

- Evaluating diffusion language models on broader domains like images, video, speech, etc. beyond just language.

Overall, the authors advocate for continued research into scaling up and specializing diffusion language models to realize their full potential across diverse tasks and modalities. They seem optimistic about diffusion models' prospects but recognize there are still challenges to overcome in areas like reasoning.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores the scalability of diffusion language models, which combine the generative power of diffusion probabilistic models and the scalability of large language models. Diffusion language models have several favorable properties compared to autoregressive language models, including a global receptive field and a non-autoregressive, drafting-then-revising generation process. However, it remains unclear whether diffusion language models can perform as well as autoregressive models on broad language tasks. 

The authors demonstrate the scalability of diffusion language models with respect to data, model size, and number of tasks. They first show that diffusion language models benefit from pretraining on massive unlabeled data, similar to autoregressive models. They then finetune models of increasing size on downstream tasks, finding performance improves with scale. Finally, they use instruction finetuning to elicit zero-shot and few-shot abilities on unseen tasks, like recent large autoregressive models. While diffusion models still struggle with complex reasoning, their flexible generation order shows promise. Overall, this work confirms the potential of scaling up diffusion language models as an alternative to autoregressive models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method to build competent diffusion language models by exploring their scalability with respect to data, model size, and tasks. The key ideas are:

1. Leverage the intrinsic connection between masked language models (MLMs) and discrete diffusion models to obtain pretrained diffusion LMs from existing pretrained MLMs like XLM-R without expensive pretraining from scratch. 

2. Perform diffusive adaptation on the pretrained MLMs by finetuning them with the diffusion training objective to reprogram them into diffusion LMs capable of sequence generation. Both task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored. 

3. Conduct experiments on various downstream tasks as well as instruction following to investigate the scalability regarding data, model sizes, and tasks. Results show diffusion LMs benefit from pretraining on large-scale data, their performance improves as model size increases, and they exhibit strong zero-shot and few-shot learning abilities when scaled up.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that scaling up diffusion LMs with massive data, larger sizes, and extensive tasks effectively transforms them into strong language learners that are competent in diverse language tasks. The proposed diffusive adaptation provides a convenient way to build large diffusion LMs by leveraging existing masked LM models.
