## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Cross-domain few-shot learning presents the challenging task of learning new classes from new domains with very limited labelled examples. Existing methods for addressing this problem have several limitations including: 1) Extensive fine-tuning of a large number of parameters during meta-testing, which leads to overfitting when data is scarce, and 2) Use of the nearest centroid classifier (NCC) for fine-tuning and inference, which lacks focus on inter-class variance and can lead to class centroids being positioned too closely, causing confusion during query classification.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a Discriminative-sample-guided and Parameter-efficient Adaptation (DIPA) approach to address the above limitations with the following main innovations:

1) Parameter-efficient adaptation during meta-testing: Instead of fine-tuning the entire model, lightweight task-specific parameters (only 0.3%-0.5% of total parameters) in the form of linear scaling and shift offsets are attached to the pre-trained model and fine-tuned. This significantly reduces overfitting. By varying the tuning depth (number of adapted layers), the authors further reduce parameters for unseen domains. 

2) Discriminative sample-guided loss: Instead of the NCC, DIPA employs a proxy-anchor loss function during fine-tuning which drives the network to associate each sample to the entire set of class anchors instead of just their own class. By considering hardness of samples and similarity to negative examples, tighter non-confusing clusters are formed. However, NCC is still employed for inference for ease of use. 

3) Feature fusion from multiple layers: Features from shallower to deeper layers are concatenated prior to classification to leverage more transferable and domain-specific patterns.

Main Contributions:

1) The lightweight adaptation strategy employing linear transformations significantly enhances parameter efficiency (upto 25-80x reduction) while improving accuracy from strong baselines.

2) Formulation of the proxy anchor loss which utilizes label and sample information for robust feature space adaptation significantly boosts performance compared to traditional loss formulations.

3) State-of-the-art performance achieved on Meta-Dataset benchmark while ensuring parameter efficiency. Demonstrates the potential for leveraging parameter-efficient methods for practical few-shot learning applications.
