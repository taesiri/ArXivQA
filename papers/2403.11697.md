## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Urban Scene Diffusion through Semantic Occupancy Map":

Problem:
- Generating large-scale, realistic 3D urban scenes with accurate geometry and semantics is important for applications like autonomous driving simulation, but remains challenging. 
- Previous works have generated visually appealing urban scenes at the pixel level, but lack underlying 3D structure. 
- Representing scenes as 3D semantic occupancy maps incorporates geometry and semantics, but generating such maps is unexplored.

Method:
- Propose UrbanDiffusion, a 3D diffusion model that generates semantic occupancy maps of urban scenes conditioned on 2D birds-eye-view (BEV) layouts.
- Uses a 3D VQ-VAE to embed real semantic occupancy maps into a lower-dimensional latent space.
- Learns a diffusion model in this latent space that is conditioned on BEV features via concatenation.
- Can generate a single scene frame, then expand it into a large-scale scene using a scene extension module.

Contributions:
- Introduces a new task of generating unbounded urban scenes with geometry and semantics in the form of semantic occupancy maps.
- Proposes a 3D diffusion model conditioned on BEV layouts that can generate diverse urban scenes and generalize to synthesized BEVs.
- Demonstrates the model's capability to expand a single scene frame into a large-scale scene.
- Shows applications like point cloud segmentation and scene image synthesis benefit from using the generated semantic occupancy maps.

In summary, this paper explores the novel problem of generating semantic occupancy map representations of urban driving scenes, and develops an approach to produce realistic, diverse, arbitrarily large scenes conditioned on BEV layouts. The generated 3D structure facilitates downstream autonomous driving tasks.
