# [Dependable Distributed Training of Compressed Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14346)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of dependable distributed training of machine learning (ML) models, especially deep neural networks (DNNs). 
- Existing work has focused on improving the average learning quality (e.g. accuracy) but overlooked the distribution and variability of the achieved quality. 
- This leads to poor dependability of the resulting ML models, whose actual performance may be much worse than the expected quality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DepL, a framework for dependable learning orchestration that makes decisions on:
   (1) which data to use for learning
   (2) which ML models to use and when to switch between them 
   (3) which clusters of nodes and their resources to leverage
- The goal is to guarantee a target learning quality is reached with a target probability, while minimizing overall training cost.
- Possible models include a full DNN and its compressed versions through techniques like pruning.
- Decisions are made by efficiently decoupling them while iterating to account for their interactions.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive system model capturing all key aspects including distribution of learning quality
- DepL solution strategy that tackles complexity and achieves near-optimal decisions
- Formal analysis proving DepL has polynomial complexity and constant competitive ratio
- Evaluation showing DepL closely matches optimum and outperforms state-of-the-art by over 27%
- First solution to account for all factors holistically to enable dependable distributed training

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in enabling dependable distributed training of ML models, with a practical solution that provides optimality guarantees.
