## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of dependable distributed training of machine learning (ML) models, especially deep neural networks (DNNs). 
- Existing work has focused on improving the average learning quality (e.g. accuracy) but overlooked the distribution and variability of the achieved quality. 
- This leads to poor dependability of the resulting ML models, whose actual performance may be much worse than the expected quality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DepL, a framework for dependable learning orchestration that makes decisions on:
   (1) which data to use for learning
   (2) which ML models to use and when to switch between them 
   (3) which clusters of nodes and their resources to leverage
- The goal is to guarantee a target learning quality is reached with a target probability, while minimizing overall training cost.
- Possible models include a full DNN and its compressed versions through techniques like pruning.
- Decisions are made by efficiently decoupling them while iterating to account for their interactions.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive system model capturing all key aspects including distribution of learning quality
- DepL solution strategy that tackles complexity and achieves near-optimal decisions
- Formal analysis proving DepL has polynomial complexity and constant competitive ratio
- Evaluation showing DepL closely matches optimum and outperforms state-of-the-art by over 27%
- First solution to account for all factors holistically to enable dependable distributed training

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in enabling dependable distributed training of ML models, with a practical solution that provides optimality guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes DepL, a framework for dependable distributed machine learning that makes optimal decisions on data, models, and resources to use in order to guarantee target learning quality and reliability at minimum cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing DepL, a framework for dependable distributed training of compressed machine learning models. Specifically:

- DepL is able to guarantee that a target learning quality (e.g. loss or accuracy) is reached by a target time and with a target probability, while minimizing the training cost. This makes the resulting ML models more dependable compared to traditional approaches that only focus on the expected learning quality.

- DepL makes joint decisions about (1) the data to leverage for learning, (2) the models to use and when to switch between them, and (3) the clusters of nodes and their resources to exploit at different stages of the training process. It accounts for the mutual interactions between these decisions and their effect on both the expected learning quality and its distribution.

- The paper proves that DepL has constant competitive ratio and polynomial complexity. It also shows through evaluations that DepL closely matches the optimum solution and outperforms the state-of-the-art by over 27%.

In summary, the key contribution is a new framework, DepL, that enables dependable distributed training of compressed ML models by holistically accounting for data, models, resources and the uncertainty in learning quality.

The paper proposes a framework called "DepL" for dependable distributed training of machine learning models, with a focus on deep neural networks. It aims to provide guarantees on achieving a target learning quality (e.g., accuracy) with a specified probability, while minimizing the overall training cost. This is done through joint optimization of decisions on which datasets, models (including compressed versions), and computational resources to utilize at different stages of the distributed training process. Both the performance and complexity of the DepL solution are analyzed, showing near-optimal competitive ratio and polynomial complexity. The approach is also shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in experiments.
