# [CAAP: Class-Dependent Automatic Data Augmentation Based On Adaptive   Policies For Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00898)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Data augmentation is commonly used to improve model performance by expanding the training data. However, existing automatic data augmentation (ADA) methods focus on overall performance and overlook class-dependent bias, leading to reduced performance on specific classes. This bias poses challenges when deploying models in real applications like medical diagnosis.

- There is a lack of research on ADA for time series data like ECG signals, which have great potential for medical applications. Applying generic ADA methods to ECG signals may introduce unknown bias for detecting certain conditions. 

- Existing ADA methods do not consider "information regions" in time series data that contain crucial diagnostic details. Augmenting these regions could introduce bias or damage model performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel ADA framework called "Class-dependent Automatic Adaptive Policies (CAAP)" to tackle the class-dependent bias problem while improving overall performance.

- CAAP has three main components:
   1) Class Adaptation Policy Network: Learns augmentation policies based on sample features and labels to generate effective and balanced policies.  
   2) Class-dependent Regulation: Adjusts no-augmentation probability to minimize class bias based on a trade-off between accuracy and bias.
   3) Information Region Adaptation: Identifies and preserves important regions in time series signals during augmentation.

- CAAP incorporates class and sample wise information to generate less biased and more reasonable augmentation samples. The class-dependent regulation and information region adaptation modules aim to mitigate bias.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first framework to regulate class bias and improve overall performance using class-adaptive policy reweighting and information region preserving.

- Introduces new metric to measure class-dependent bias and demonstrates trade-off between accuracy and bias reduction. 

- Incorporates class/sample-wise information for low-bias and effective augmentation policies in ADA.

- Experiments on ECG datasets show CAAP achieves lower class bias and higher overall accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. Highlights reliability as an ADA technique for time series modeling.
