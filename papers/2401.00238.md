# [How to Evaluate Coreference in Literary Texts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00238)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing coreference resolution systems and evaluation metrics are inadequate for analyzing long literary texts like novels. They are designed for short texts and make unrealistic assumptions.
- Popular evaluation metrics like MUC, CEAF, BLANC have known limitations - they don't properly handle singletons, weigh all entities equally regardless of importance, and can't be easily interpreted by humans. 
- Standard reference corpus like OntoNotes comprises of short texts and short coreference chains unlike novels which have very long chains for main characters.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate coreference chains differently based on their linguistic properties rather than a single score. Specifically, distinguish between - (1) long chains referring to main characters, (2) short chains referring to secondary characters, (3) singletons referring to isolated entity mentions.
- Calculate traditional metrics separately for these groups to get a clearer picture of where the system does well and where it struggles.
- This linguistically-informed analysis will be more useful for digital humanities scholars than a single NLP-based score.

Main Contributions:
- Showing inadequacy of existing coreference evaluation methods for analyzing novels and long literary texts
- Proposing more interpretable evaluation scheme based on linguistically categorizing coreference chains into main characters, secondary characters and singletons
- Tailoring coreference evaluation to needs of digital humanists rather than just NLP comparisons of systems

In summary, the paper demonstrates issues with current coreference evaluation methods on literary texts, and proposes an alternative analysis scheme more aligned with needs of humanities scholars, by categorizing coreference chains on linguistic properties.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper examines limitations of existing coreference evaluation metrics, especially for long literary texts, and proposes a new approach based on distinguishing between main characters, secondary characters, and singletons to get more interpretable results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new way of evaluating coreference resolution systems when applied to literary texts such as novels. Specifically:

- The paper argues that existing coreference evaluation metrics and benchmarks (like OntoNotes) are inadequate for evaluating performance on long literary texts like novels. The metrics can be difficult to interpret and novels have very different properties than the short news documents in OntoNotes (much longer coreference chains, skewed distributions, etc).

- To address this, the paper proposes evaluating coreference resolution on novels by separating out three different types of coreference chains: long chains corresponding to main characters, short chains for secondary characters, and singletons. It argues that reporting performance specifically on these different categories can give a more informative and interpretable picture of how well a coreference resolution system is working on literary texts. 

- So in summary, the key contribution is arguing for a new way of evaluating coreference resolvers when applied to novels and other literary texts, by splitting evaluation based on linguistically-motivated categories of coreference chains rather than relying on a single metric. This is proposed to make evaluation more informative and tailored to the digital humanities application.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes distinguishing between long coreference chains, short chains, and singletons when evaluating coreference resolution on literary texts. Why is this categorization useful? What are the key differences between these categories that motivate evaluating them separately?

2. When evaluating coreference on novels, the paper argues that existing metrics like MUC and CEAF are not informative or interpretable. What specifically makes these metrics inadequate or uninterpretable when applied to literary texts? 

3. The paper argues that the OntoNotes dataset, commonly used to evaluate coreference resolution, is inappropriate for evaluating performance on novels. What are the key differences between OntoNotes documents and novels that contribute to this inappropriateness?

4. The distribution of coreference chain lengths in novels can be highly skewed, with a few very long chains for main characters. How could an evaluation approach take into account this skewed distribution rather than treating all chains equally?

5. The paper categorizes secondary/minor characters as an important group to evaluate separately. What makes evaluating this group challenging? Should all mentions of "the coachman" be considered coreferent, for example?

6. What specific information could an analysis of performance on long chains, short chains, and singletons provide that current metrics do not capture well? How could this inform future system development?

7. The paper suggests that averaging scores like MUC, CEAF, and B3 is not informative. Why is calculating an average problematic when these metrics take such different approaches? 

8. How feasible is a fine-grained linguistic analysis of system performance on different coreference chain types across a range of novels in different languages? What annotation challenges exist?

9. Would the categorization proposed still allow for any quantitative comparison of coreference resolution systems, or only a qualitative analysis? If only qualitative, does this matter?

10. How might the interpretability vs comparability tradeoff play out with this method? Does losing some ability to directly compare systems matter if humanists get more insight into performance on literary texts?
