# [How to Evaluate Coreference in Literary Texts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00238)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing coreference resolution systems and evaluation metrics are inadequate for analyzing long literary texts like novels. They are designed for short texts and make unrealistic assumptions.
- Popular evaluation metrics like MUC, CEAF, BLANC have known limitations - they don't properly handle singletons, weigh all entities equally regardless of importance, and can't be easily interpreted by humans. 
- Standard reference corpus like OntoNotes comprises of short texts and short coreference chains unlike novels which have very long chains for main characters.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate coreference chains differently based on their linguistic properties rather than a single score. Specifically, distinguish between - (1) long chains referring to main characters, (2) short chains referring to secondary characters, (3) singletons referring to isolated entity mentions.
- Calculate traditional metrics separately for these groups to get a clearer picture of where the system does well and where it struggles.
- This linguistically-informed analysis will be more useful for digital humanities scholars than a single NLP-based score.

Main Contributions:
- Showing inadequacy of existing coreference evaluation methods for analyzing novels and long literary texts
- Proposing more interpretable evaluation scheme based on linguistically categorizing coreference chains into main characters, secondary characters and singletons
- Tailoring coreference evaluation to needs of digital humanists rather than just NLP comparisons of systems

In summary, the paper demonstrates issues with current coreference evaluation methods on literary texts, and proposes an alternative analysis scheme more aligned with needs of humanities scholars, by categorizing coreference chains on linguistic properties.
