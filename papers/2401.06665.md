# [PolyTOPS: Reconfigurable and Flexible Polyhedral Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06665)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the need for flexibility and configurability in polyhedral schedulers. Polyhedral techniques are used for automatic loop optimization and transformation in compilers. Several polyhedral schedulers have been proposed (e.g. Pluto, Feautrier, isl) but each targets a specific architecture or scenario. As hardware architectures become more heterogeneous, scenario-specific optimization is increasingly needed. Existing schedulers lack flexibility to adapt to new scenarios and configurability to guide the scheduler.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes PolyTOPS, a novel configurable and flexible polyhedral scheduler. The key innovations are:

Configurability: PolyTOPS allows easy specification of schedule strategies through configuration interfaces (JSON or C++). Users can compose and extend predefined strategies or define new ones. Fine-grained control over all aspects of scheduling is possible - cost functions, constraints, statement distribution/fusion, directives. This allows adapting the scheduler to new scenarios.

Flexibility: PolyTOPS moves away from a "one-size-fits-all" scheduler. It has a versatile design that can address scenario/architecture specific optimizations through incremental adjustments of a base strategy. Constraints and heuristics can be tuned differently for each statement and loop.

Main Contributions:
- Design and implementation of PolyTOPS with innovative configurability and flexibility
- Demonstrated ability to mimic and outperform state-of-the-art schedulers 
- Adaptability to multiple architectures like CPU, GPU and NPU
- Integration into MindSpore compiler and custom operator optimization
- Up to 34x speedup over isl scheduler on NPU
- Up to 1.8x geomean speedup over Pluto on CPU

In summary, PolyTOPS is a novel configurable and flexible polyhedral scheduler that through simple configuration interfaces can adapt optimization strategies to diverse hardware architectures and compiler scenarios. Both configurability and flexibility are crucial innovations over state-of-the-art black-box schedulers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

PolyTOPS is a new configurable and flexible polyhedral scheduling tool that allows easy specification of optimization strategies and adapts well to multiple hardware architectures, outperforming state-of-the-art schedulers on several benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of PolyTOPS are:

1. Configurability: PolyTOPS provides an easy-to-use interface to tailor scheduling strategies through configuration files. All aspects of an iterative polyhedral scheduler can be configured, including parallelism control, vectorization, locality optimizations, statement fusion/fission, and partial schedule specifications. Predefined or new strategies can be composed or extended.

2. Flexibility: PolyTOPS exhibits a versatile design that can address scenario-specific optimizations for different architectures (CPUs, GPUs, NPUs) and compilers. It moves away from a "one-size-fits-all" scheduler approach and allows incremental adjustments to a strategy for particular loops or architectures. The infrastructure is extendable to enable tuning down to the level of dedicated heuristics for each statement and loop.

In summary, the main innovation of PolyTOPS is providing an easily configurable and flexible polyhedral scheduler to produce architecture-oriented optimizations for different scenarios. This is in contrast to existing schedulers that tend to be black-box and tailored to a single objective.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the polyhedral scheduling method proposed in the paper:

1) How does PolyTOPS allow for configuration and control over the schedule generation process compared to other state-of-the-art polyhedral schedulers like Pluto? What specifics can be configured?

2) Explain the workflow and overall architecture of PolyTOPS. In particular, discuss the role of the configuration block and how it enables the flexibility and configurability of PolyTOPS. 

3) Elaborate on the local and global configuration options available in PolyTOPS. Provide concrete examples of how they can be used to customize the scheduling behavior.

4) The paper shows impressive speedups on custom operators for an Ascend NPU using PolyTOPS versus isl scheduling. Walk through the process and configurations used to achieve these optimizations. What directives or constraints guided the scheduler?

5) PolyTOPS is benchmarked on CPU architectures against Pluto. Analyze the different scheduling strategies (pluto-style, tensor-style, isl-style) and how they perform across different Polybench kernels. When does each strategy work best and why?

6) Explain the concept of kernel-specific configurations in PolyTOPS and how they are constructed. Provide some examples from the Polybench benchmark results. How much speedup do these specialized configurations provide over the generic strategies?

7) The paper analyzes how dataset size impacts optimization choices using the Jacobi-1d benchmark. Summarize this analysis and what it indicates about tuning transformations based on kernel properties.  

8) Compare and contrast the PolyTOPS approach with other related configurable scheduling methods like PolyLingual, Tiramisu, and Constraint Injection. What are the tradeoffs?

9) Discuss the results on the PolyMage benchmark suite. What makes these image processing kernels challenging to optimize and how does PolyTOPS fare against other schedulers?

10) What fusion heuristics are currently available in PolyTOPS and what extensions does the paper suggest can be made in the future? How big of an impact can the fusion strategy have on performance?
