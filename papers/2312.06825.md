# [Utilization of Non-verbal Behaviour and Social Gaze in Classroom   Human-Robot Interaction Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06825)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robots used in classroom settings for language learning often face failures in interaction and communication which negatively impact the quality of human-robot interaction (HRI). These failures can be technical, social norm violations, communication issues, or misalignment in understanding the interaction goal.

- Additional communication channels like non-verbal behavior and social gaze cues could help mitigate such failures by providing redundancy, sustaining engagement, communicating system state, and enabling joint attention.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement a heuristic social gaze model based on visual psychology research into the robot's cognitive architecture to facilitate more natural and robust classroom HRI. 

- Conduct two studies with the iCub robot embodying different personalities and roles:
   1) Teacher/student/collaborator, introvert/extrovert in language learning scenarios
   2) Incorporate the Social Gaze Space (SGS) model into robot architecture

Contributions:
- Show the impact of robot role and personality expressed through nonverbal behavior on perception, teaching efficacy

- Novel implementation of the SGS social gaze model using only the iCub's onboard sensors for a biologically inspired attentional system  

- Investigate if heuristic gaze models can positively influence interaction quality, participant perceptions, efficacy and learning through enabling of joint attention and redundancy.

The paper gives background on classroom HRI failures, motivation for using nonverbal behaviors like social gaze, overview of two studies manipulating robot role/personality and incorporating an SGS model, and intended future work on assessing the model's impact on HRI and learning.
