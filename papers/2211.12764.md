# [VoP: Text-Video Co-operative Prompt Tuning for Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12764)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we efficiently adapt large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to downstream video-based tasks like text-video retrieval, without significant fine-tuning that may cause overfitting or forgetting of pre-trained knowledge?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) By freezing the backbone model and only tuning small additional prompt parameters, we can efficiently adapt the model while retaining most of the pre-trained knowledge. 

2) Designing video-specific prompt solutions that incorporate positional, contextual, and functional information can further improve adaptation and performance on text-video retrieval compared to just using regular visual prompts.

3) Combinations of text and video prompt tuning can match or exceed the performance of full fine-tuning of the entire model, but with much lower training overhead.

So in summary, the central research direction is efficient and effective adaptation of large pre-trained vision-language models to video domains via prompt tuning, with a focus on the text-video retrieval task. The key hypotheses relate to the benefits of collaborative text and video prompt design for model tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contribution seems to be proposing a method called VoP (Text-Video Co-operative Prompt Tuning) for efficient tuning of CLIP for text-video retrieval. The key ideas include:

- Introducing tunable prompts in both the text and visual encoders of CLIP to adapt it to text-video retrieval with very few trainable parameters (only 0.1%).

- Designing three novel video prompt mechanisms based on video-specific characteristics like frame position, context, and layer function. This further improves performance over just using regular prompts.

- Experiments on five text-video retrieval benchmarks show VoP and its variants with video prompts can outperform full fine-tuning of CLIP with much lower overhead in trainable parameters.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be developing prompt tuning strategies specifically for adapting CLIP to text-video retrieval in a parameter-efficient manner, including introducing the idea of specialized video prompts. The methods achieve strong performance compared to full fine-tuning but with significantly fewer parameters.
