# [VoP: Text-Video Co-operative Prompt Tuning for Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12764)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we efficiently adapt large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to downstream video-based tasks like text-video retrieval, without significant fine-tuning that may cause overfitting or forgetting of pre-trained knowledge?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) By freezing the backbone model and only tuning small additional prompt parameters, we can efficiently adapt the model while retaining most of the pre-trained knowledge. 

2) Designing video-specific prompt solutions that incorporate positional, contextual, and functional information can further improve adaptation and performance on text-video retrieval compared to just using regular visual prompts.

3) Combinations of text and video prompt tuning can match or exceed the performance of full fine-tuning of the entire model, but with much lower training overhead.

So in summary, the central research direction is efficient and effective adaptation of large pre-trained vision-language models to video domains via prompt tuning, with a focus on the text-video retrieval task. The key hypotheses relate to the benefits of collaborative text and video prompt design for model tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contribution seems to be proposing a method called VoP (Text-Video Co-operative Prompt Tuning) for efficient tuning of CLIP for text-video retrieval. The key ideas include:

- Introducing tunable prompts in both the text and visual encoders of CLIP to adapt it to text-video retrieval with very few trainable parameters (only 0.1%).

- Designing three novel video prompt mechanisms based on video-specific characteristics like frame position, context, and layer function. This further improves performance over just using regular prompts.

- Experiments on five text-video retrieval benchmarks show VoP and its variants with video prompts can outperform full fine-tuning of CLIP with much lower overhead in trainable parameters.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be developing prompt tuning strategies specifically for adapting CLIP to text-video retrieval in a parameter-efficient manner, including introducing the idea of specialized video prompts. The methods achieve strong performance compared to full fine-tuning but with significantly fewer parameters.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in text-video cross-modal retrieval:

- This paper focuses on adapting pretrained vision-language models like CLIP to the text-video retrieval task, while much other work has proposed new architectures trained from scratch. Transferring pretrained knowledge is attractive for efficiency.

- The paper explores prompt tuning as an efficient fine-tuning strategy that introduces very few trainable parameters. Other works on this task have tended to fully fine-tune the entire pretrained model, which can cause catastrophic forgetting. 

- The proposed VoP method tunes prompts for both the text and visual encoders, while some prior work only prompts the text side. Co-operative prompting of both modalities can better align the joint embedding space.

- Unique to video retrieval, this paper designs several video-specific prompt mechanisms that model temporal information like frame position and context. This is novel compared to standard visual prompt tuning methods that treat all input frames equally.

- Experiments demonstrate VoP requires far fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning but still achieves very competitive or superior performance. The video prompts provide meaningful gains over just using generic visual prompts.

- Overall, this work makes video retrieval more practical by reducing the overhead of full fine-tuning large pretrained models. The video prompt designs are tailored for this task, advancing beyond basic prompt tuning. The results validate prompt tuning as an efficient adapter method for adapting foundation models.

In summary, the cooperative prompting framework and video-specific prompt designs make valuable contributions compared to existing techniques for efficient and effective text-video retrieval. The innovations in adapting pretrained models are well-motivated.
