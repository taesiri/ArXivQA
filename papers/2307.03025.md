# [Style Over Substance: Evaluation Biases for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03025)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How capable and reliable are human judges and large language models (LLMs) in evaluating machine-generated text, and what biases or limitations exist in their evaluation approaches? 

The key hypotheses examined in this study are:

1) Both human judges and LLMs demonstrate biases and inconsistencies when evaluating machine-generated text across dimensions like accuracy, helpfulness, and language quality.

2) Collapsing multiple evaluation dimensions into a single score results in an incomplete and potentially misleading assessment of machine-generated text. 

3) Independently evaluating machine-generated text across multiple dimensions leads to more comprehensive and transparent insights into text quality.

To test these hypotheses, the authors systematically generate machine text with controlled variations in accuracy, language errors, and length. They then have these texts evaluated by crowd workers, experts, and LLMs based on different scoring schemes. Their analysis of the results reveals intriguing differences in how humans and LLMs approach evaluation, including biases favoring longer text and limitations in detecting factual errors. Their proposed multi-dimensional rating system appears to improve certain aspects of evaluation, particularly factual accuracy. Overall, this study provides an insightful examination into the evaluation of machine-generated text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper investigates the behavior of human and LLM judges in evaluating machine-generated text, specifically focusing on biases and limitations in assessing answer quality. The key contributions are:

1. The study reveals several issues in current evaluation methods that rely on a single unified score, including the inability to thoroughly evaluate different factors like accuracy, helpfulness, and language quality individually. 

2. Through a meticulously created set of machine-generated answers with controlled language proficiency, factual accuracy, and length, the analysis uncovers fascinating insights into human and LLM judges:

- Humans exhibit hesitancy and inconsistencies compared to LLMs.
- Humans overlook factual inaccuracies easily compared to LLMs. 
- Both prefer lengthy responses over succinct ones.
- LLMs exhibit bias toward the first response.

3. To address these limitations, the paper proposes the Multi-Elo Rating System to evaluate machine text across dimensions of Accuracy, Helpfulness, and Language independently. 

4. Empirical results demonstrate this multi-dimensional approach significantly improves evaluation quality, especially factual accuracy evaluation by LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is highlighting the biases and flaws of current unified evaluation methods for machine text through a controlled study, and proposing an improved multi-dimensional evaluation framework to enable more comprehensive and transparent understanding. The paper provides valuable insights into human and machine evaluation behaviors.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper investigates the behavior and potential biases of human judges and large language models (LLMs) in evaluating the quality of machine-generated text. It finds that both humans and LLMs demonstrate flaws in assessment, with human judges prone to inconsistency and lack of fact-checking, while LLMs favor longer responses regardless of accuracy. To address this, the authors propose a multi-dimensional evaluation system that evaluates machine text across different aspects like accuracy, helpfulness and language quality.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several valuable contributions that advance the field of evaluating large language models (LLMs). Here is a comparison to related work:

- The paper thoroughly investigates both human and LLM evaluators by intentionally introducing different types of errors into machine-generated text. Most prior work focuses on either human or LLM evaluators, but not both. Comparing them side-by-side on the same carefully controlled dataset provides unique insights.

- The analysis of human annotator limitations and biases is more comprehensive than previous studies. Fact-checking ability, text length bias, and answer order bias are all examined in detail across both crowd workers and experts. This shines a light on the nuances of human evaluation.

- The proposal of a Multi-Elo Rating System that evaluates machine text across multiple dimensions is novel. Breaking the evaluation into accuracy, helpfulness, and language factors is intuitively appealing. This is different from prior approaches that use a single score.

- The empirical results demonstrate that multi-dimensional evaluation significantly enhances LLM assessment, especially factual accuracy. This supports the value of the proposed technique.

- The conclusions provide pragmatic advice for practitioners on avoiding pitfalls in evaluation. Recommendations like using experts over crowd workers and evaluating across dimensions are impactful.

In summary, this paper makes thoughtful additions to the literature by conducting a multifaceted evaluation, proposing a new technique, and deriving meaningful recommendations. The insights on human and LLM limitations are especially enlightening. This moves forward research on appropriately and comprehensively evaluating LLMs.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the evaluation of machine-generated text by both human judges and large language models (LLMs). To study this, the authors curate a dataset of intentionally flawed answers generated by GPT-4 with varying levels of factual errors, language proficiency, and text length. They calculate Elo ratings based on judgments from crowd-sourced annotators, expert annotators, GPT-4, and Claude-1 to analyze their evaluation capabilities and biases. Key findings are that human judges, especially crowd-sourced ones, often fail to thoroughly fact-check answers and exhibit biases like favoring longer text. LLMs demonstrate some fact-checking ability but also biases toward longer text and the order of answers. To address these issues, the authors propose a Multi-Elo Rating System that evaluates machine text across multiple dimensions like accuracy, helpfulness, and language quality independently. Empirical results show this significantly improves the quality of LLM-based evaluation but not crowd-sourced evaluation, indicating further research is needed. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the limitations of current evaluation methods for machine-generated text.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

<answer>
The paper investigates the limitations of human judges and large language models (LLMs) as evaluators of machine-generated text. The authors create a dataset of intentionally flawed answers generated by GPT-4 to test human and LLM evaluation capabilities regarding factual accuracy, language quality, and text length. Crowd-sourced and expert human annotators as well as LLM judges GPT-4 and Claude-1 are then used to evaluate the quality of these answers and calculate Elo ratings. 

The analysis reveals several issues with current evaluation methods. Both human and LLM judges demonstrate biases, such as favoring longer text regardless of quality. Crowd-sourced annotators particularly struggle with inconsistent fact-checking compared to experts and LLMs. However, the LLMs also overlook factual errors at times. Interestingly, crowd-sourced annotators appear unbiased regarding answer order while LLMs favor the first answer and experts the second. Given these limitations, the authors propose a Multi-Elo Rating System that evaluates machine-generated text across multiple quality dimensions independently. Empirical results show this significantly enhances evaluation quality, especially factual accuracy assessment by GPT-4. Overall, the study provides important insights into human and LLM evaluation behaviors.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel multi-dimensional evaluation approach called the Multi-Elo Rating System to assess the outputs of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework for machine translation evaluation, this method evaluates LLMs on three main dimensions - accuracy, helpfulness, and language quality. For each dimension, the LLM outputs are compared in a pairwise fashion to compute Elo ratings, a metric adapted from chess rankings. By breaking down the evaluation into multiple aspects rather than a single score, this allows gaining deeper insights into model capabilities and limitations. To implement this, slight modifications are made to the human evaluation interface to collect ratings across the three dimensions. For LLM judges like GPT-4, independent queries are made for each dimension versus a single compound query. By evaluating outputs across accuracy, helpfulness, and language quality independently, the goal is to achieve more comprehensive and transparent assessments.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of accurately and comprehensively evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it is investigating whether human judges and LLMs are qualified as evaluators when comparing the outputs from different language models. The key questions examined in the paper are:

1) How consistent and reliable are human judges (both crowd-sourced and experts) in evaluating the quality of machine-generated text across different dimensions like factual accuracy, language proficiency, and text length? 

2) Do human judges thoroughly fact-check the machine-generated text or overlook errors if the overall output seems coherent? 

3) Do human judges demonstrate any biases, such as favoring longer text or the order in which answers are presented?

4) How does the evaluation capability of LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-1 compare to that of human judges? Are they more consistent? Do they exhibit similar biases? How accurately can they identify factual errors?

5) What is the best approach for comprehensively evaluating machine-generated text - single unified scores or multi-dimensional assessment? Can breaking evaluation into aspects like accuracy, helpfulness and language quality lead to better insights?

In summary, the key focus is examining the limitations of current evaluation practices for LLMs using human and LLM judges and proposing improvements via a multi-dimensional assessment framework. The paper aims to provide guidance to practitioners on exercising caution with certain evaluation methods and adopting more holistic approaches.
