# [PAP-REC: Personalized Automatic Prompt for Recommendation Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent recommendation language models (RLMs) like P5 can solve multiple recommendation tasks using manually designed prompts. However, crafting effective prompts requires significant human effort and expertise. Slight changes to the prompt can lead to huge performance differences. Thus, there is a need to automatically generate optimal personalized prompts to enhance RLM performance. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes PAP-REC, a framework to automatically generate personalized prompts for RLMs using a gradient-based method. Key aspects:

1) Personalized prompts allow different users to have different prompt tokens for the same task. This expands the search space.

2) Surrogate recommendation metrics are proposed for prompt token selection to handle non-differentiability and focus on top-k results.

3) An iterative, alternative schedule updates user-specific and task-specific tokens to tackle the expanded search space.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first automated personalized prompt generation framework PAP-REC for RLMs 

- Develops surrogate metrics specific to recommendation tasks for effective and efficient prompt generation

- Handles expanded search space for personalized prompts via alternative user/task token updating

- Experiments show prompts from PAP-REC consistently outperform manual prompts and various recommendation baselines on three datasets across three tasks using P5 model

The key innovation is enabling automated optimization of personalized prompts for RLMs via a combination of gradient-based search, surrogate metrics and an alternating update schedule. This removes the need for manually designing prompts and leads to performance improvements.
