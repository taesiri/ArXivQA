# [DiffuCOMET: Contextual Commonsense Knowledge Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Inferring contextually-relevant and diverse commonsense knowledge to understand narratives remains challenging for knowledge models. 
- Existing knowledge models are trained on general commonsense graphs and tend to produce valid but contextually-irrelevant inferences when applied to real-world narratives. 
- Autoregressive training objectives also limit the diversity of inferences identified for a given context.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops DiffuCOMET, a series of knowledge models based on diffusion models, to generate contextual commonsense inferences. 
- DiffuCOMET uses multiple rounds of diffusion to refine the connections between a narrative context and relevant commonsense facts.
- Two formulations are proposed: DiffuCOMET-Fact reconstructs fact embeddings, while DiffuCOMET-Entity separately reconstructs head and tail entities and predicts relations between them.  
- Cross-attention grounds the diffusion process to the narrative context.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces diffusion models for contextual commonsense knowledge generation and shows superior performance over autoregressive baselines.
- Proposes new evaluation metrics beyond surface-form matching that measure diversity and contextual relevance of generated knowledge.
- Demonstrates better balance between relevance, alignment to references, and knowledge diversity compared to baselines.  
- Generalizes better to out-of-distribution test contexts.
- Produces more novel knowledge tuples beyond the training graph.
- Also shows strong performance on factual WebNLG+ knowledge generation, highlighting generalizability.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in applying diffusion models to generate richer, more diverse and contextually-relevant commonsense knowledge for narratives. The proposed evaluation metrics provide better assessment of quality and diversity in this space.
