# [Divide and Conquer: Answering Questions with Object Factorization and   Compositional Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10482)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

Whether integrating the compositionality of objects and reasoning processes can enhance the generalizability and interpretability of visual reasoning models. 

Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:

1) Learning to represent objects by their semantic characteristics (via object factorization) will allow models to better correlate novel and known objects.

2) Using these learned semantic prototypes in a structured, compositional reasoning process (a neural module network) will improve generalizability to diverse objects and question distributions, as well as enhance interpretability.

3) Tightly coupling the compositionality of objects and reasoning will be more effective than considering them in isolation.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that compositionality of objects and reasoning, when tightly integrated, will lead to more generalizable and interpretable visual reasoning compared to existing approaches. The method proposes and tests a new framework aimed at achieving these goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an integral framework to enable generalizable and interpretable visual reasoning in AI systems. Specifically, it makes the following key contributions:

1. It proposes a novel method to automatically factorize objects into discriminative prototypes that encode key object characteristics. This allows bridging novel and known objects.

2. It develops a new neural module network that incorporates object prototypes into an explicit reasoning process. This improves generalizability against object diversity and data biases. 

3. It demonstrates the advantages of tightly integrating compositionality of objects and reasoning for enhancing model generalizability and interpretability.

4. It performs extensive experiments and analyses that validate the effectiveness of the framework on zero-shot VQA and VQA with out-of-distribution questions.

In summary, the main novelty lies in the principled integration of object factorization and compositional reasoning to simultaneously improve the generalizability and interpretability of visual reasoning models. The experiments demonstrate the promise of the framework for developing more robust AI systems that can reason on real-world data.
