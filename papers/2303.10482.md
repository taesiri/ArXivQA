# [Divide and Conquer: Answering Questions with Object Factorization and   Compositional Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10482)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

Whether integrating the compositionality of objects and reasoning processes can enhance the generalizability and interpretability of visual reasoning models. 

Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:

1) Learning to represent objects by their semantic characteristics (via object factorization) will allow models to better correlate novel and known objects.

2) Using these learned semantic prototypes in a structured, compositional reasoning process (a neural module network) will improve generalizability to diverse objects and question distributions, as well as enhance interpretability.

3) Tightly coupling the compositionality of objects and reasoning will be more effective than considering them in isolation.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that compositionality of objects and reasoning, when tightly integrated, will lead to more generalizable and interpretable visual reasoning compared to existing approaches. The method proposes and tests a new framework aimed at achieving these goals.
