# [KorNAT: LLM Alignment Benchmark for Korean Social Values and Common   Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13605)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most large language models (LLMs) today exhibit bias towards Western cultures and lack understanding of diverse global values. 
- There is a need to evaluate how aligned LLMs are with the culture and basic knowledge of specific countries.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce the concept of "national alignment" to measure how aligned an LLM is with a targeted nation from two aspects: 
  1) social value alignment 
  2) common knowledge alignment
- Social value alignment evaluates how well an LLM understands a nation's social values.
- Common knowledge alignment examines how well an LLM captures basic knowledge related to that nation.  

Main Contributions:  
- The authors constructed KorNAT, the first dataset to measure national alignment with South Korea. It contains:
  - A social value dataset with 4K multiple-choice questions. Ground truth labels were obtained from a large-scale survey of over 6K Korean participants.
  - A common knowledge dataset with 6K multiple-choice questions based on Korean textbooks and curriculum.
- Detailed dataset curation process designed based on statistical sampling theory and refined through multiple rounds of human review.
- KorNAT approved by an organization of the Korean government after thorough quality assessment.
- New metrics introduced to quantify national alignment, including three variations of social value alignment score.
- Experiments conducted on 7 LLMs reveal only a couple models meet baseline thresholds, showing much room for improving national alignment.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions around evaluating cultural alignment of AI systems and provides a rigorous framework and benchmark tailored to South Korea. The dataset curation process is also generalizable to other countries.
