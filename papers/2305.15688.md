# [Frame-Event Alignment and Fusion Network for High Frame Rate Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15688)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we combine the complementary information from conventional frame cameras and event cameras to achieve robust high frame rate object tracking?

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question are:

- Proposing a novel end-to-end framework (AFNet) to effectively combine frames and events for high frame rate tracking. This is the first work to exploit both modalities for high frame rate tracking.

- Designing an event-guided cross-modality alignment (ECA) module to align features from frames and events. This performs both cross-style and cross-frame-rate alignment.

- Presenting a cross-correlation fusion (CF) module to emphasize valuable information and suppress noise by fusing complementary cues from the two modalities.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art tracking performance on event-based datasets, with robust high frame rate tracking up to 240Hz.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that by properly aligning and fusing frames and events, the complementary information from the two modalities can enable robust high frame rate tracking. The proposed AFNet framework and its components aim to validate this hypothesis.
