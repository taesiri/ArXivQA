# [BigGait: Learning Gait Representation You Want by Large Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19122)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "BigGait: Learning Gait Representation You Want by Large Vision Models":

Problem: 
Existing gait recognition methods rely heavily on task-specific upstream models (e.g. segmentation, parsing, pose estimation) to provide gait representations. This introduces several challenges: high annotation costs, restricted representation forms, and potential error accumulation. 

Solution - BigGait:
The paper proposes a new gait recognition framework called BigGait that utilizes general-purpose features from Large Vision Models (LVMs) to construct gait representations without task-specific supervision. 

Key components:
- Upstream: Self-supervised LVM (DINOv2) that extracts general visual features 
- Downstream: Gait recognition model (GaitBase) for metric learning
- Central module: Gait Representation Extractor (GRE) with 3 branches - Masks background; Appearance transforms features; Denoising refines features

GRE relies on soft geometrical constraints to extract effective gait features - capturing body structure while excluding unrelated noise.

Contributions:
- Pioneering work in utilizing task-agnostic LVMs for gait recognition 
- Proposes BigGait framework with GRE module to transform general features into gait representations
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization ability
- Discusses key challenges (interpretability, purity) and future directions for LVMs-based gait recognition

Overall, the paper presents a new paradigm for gait representation learning without reliance on task-specific upstream models, opening promising directions for next-generation gait recognition powered by LVMs.
