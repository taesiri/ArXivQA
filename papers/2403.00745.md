# [AtP*: An efficient and scalable method for localizing LLM behaviour to   components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00745)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Identifying which internal components (e.g. attention heads, neurons) are causally responsible for a model's behavior is important for interpretability, but exhaustively evaluating contributions across all components is prohibitively expensive for large models.

- "Activation Patching" measures a component's contribution by replacing its activation with a reference activation taken from a corrupted input, and measuring the change in model output. But it still requires separate forward passes for each component. 

- The paper aims to find a much faster approximation that can reliably estimate contributions for all components simultaneously.

Proposed Solution - Attribution Patching (AtP)
- AtP uses first-order Taylor expansion of the model output w.r.t. a component's activation. This linear approximation can be computed for all components in just 2 forward passes and 1 backward pass.

- However, AtP has failure modes leading to false negatives: 
  - Attention saturation: AtP's linear approx fails when attention distribution changes drastically between clean and reference input.
  - Cancellation: Positive and negative effects can cancel out across prompt pairs.
  
- To address this, the paper proposes "AtP*":
  - Fixes attention saturation issue by explicitly recomputing attention probabilities when patching queries/keys.
  - Reduces cancellation issue by modifying backpropagation to "drop" some downstream gradients.
  
- The paper also proposes diagnostic methods to statistically bound the effect size of any remaining false negatives.

Contributions
- First systematic evaluation of AtP showing it significantly outperforms alternatives like subset sampling or blocking.

- Identification and mitigation of AtP's failure modes to create more reliable AtP*.

- Exploration of AtP for edge attribution, and analysis of computational tradeoffs.

- Guidance on best attribution method to use based on use case constraints.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that AtP and AtP* enable much faster yet still reliable estimation of model component contributions compared to traditional activation patching, enabling more scalable interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes improvements to Attribution Patching, a fast approximation method for identifying the most causally important components in large language models, addresses failure modes leading to false negatives, and benchmarks the improved method against alternatives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Investigating the performance of Attribution Patching (AtP), finding two classes of failure modes which produce false negatives. 

2. Proposing a variant called AtP* with two changes to address these failure modes: fixing attention saturation by recomputing the softmax when patching queries/keys, and using dropout on the backwards pass (GradDrop) to address cancellation failure modes.

3. Introducing several alternative methods to approximate Activation Patching as baselines to compare AtP to.

4. Presenting the first systematic study comparing AtP, AtP*, and these alternative methods, showing that AtP outperforms the alternatives, with AtP* providing further significant improvement. 

5. Providing a diagnostic method using subsampling to statistically bound the probability of remaining false negatives from AtP*, to test reliability without exhaustive verification.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing an improved method AtP* for fast approximation of activation patching, evaluating it systematically against alternatives, and providing diagnostics to test its reliability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Activation patching - A method for causally attributing model behavior to components by replacing activations with samples from a reference input. Also called causal mediation analysis.

- Attribution patching (AtP) - A fast, approximate gradient-based method for estimating activation patching effects without doing the full patching procedure.

- Failure modes - Situations where AtP produces false negatives by underestimating true causal impacts. Two key failure modes discussed are attention saturation and cancellation. 

- AtP* - An improved variant of AtP proposed in the paper to address the failure modes. Involves fixes for queries/keys (QKfix) and dropout on the backward pass (GradDrop).

- Diagnostics - Method to statistically bound the probability that AtP* is still missing any high-impact false negatives, without exhaustively verifying all components.  

- Nodes - The model components being analyzed. Key options discussed are attention nodes (heads) and neuron nodes (individual MLP neurons).

- Edges - Extending analysis from nodes to edges between nodes, requiring approximating the effect of patching input to one node on an downstream node's activations.

- Prompt pair distributions - Used to average causal effects. Single prompt pairs and broader distributions used to evaluate performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two main improvements to Attribution Patching (AtP), addressing attention saturation (QK fix) and cancellation of effects (GradDrop). In what ways could these improvements potentially fail or have limitations? For example, are there any model components or behaviors where they would still produce false negatives?

2. The paper evaluates the methods primarily on decoder-only transformer language models. How well would you expect the methods to work on other model architectures like convolutional networks or Vision Transformers? Would any adjustments need to be made?

3. The choice of what model components to intervene on (the node set N) has a large effect on the localization result. What considerations should go into choosing the node granularity? What are the tradeoffs between finer-grained (e.g. neurons) and coarser attribution (e.g. layers)?  

4. The paper assumes a distribution over prompt pairs for evaluation. What potential issues could arise if the distribution does not adequately cover the space of behaviors/circuits of interest? How could the choice of distribution impact method performance?

5. The paper focuses on identifying components with the largest causal effects. Would the proposed methods work as well for estimating the precise effect magnitudes for all components? What changes would need to be made to reliably estimate effect sizes?

6. How well would the proposed methods apply to other forms of causal intervention like mean/zero ablation compared to resample ablation? What adjustments might be needed?

7. The paper considers next-token prediction metrics based on language models. How could the methods be extended to other types of models and metrics like image classification accuracy? Would any modifications be required?

8. The paper looks at noising interventions. How would using denoising interventions potentially change the performance and applicability of AtP/AtP*? Should any adjustments be made to the methods?

9. The paper focuses on feedforward causal attribution. Could similar methods work for feedback or cyclic graphs? What complications arise from bidirectional dependencies rather than feedforward processing?

10. The GradDrop technique seems loosely motivated from the perspective of direct/indirect effects. Could formalizing this connection lead to better heuristics for avoiding cancellation failures? How might direct effect methods like iNNvestigate interact with AtP?
