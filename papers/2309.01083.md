# [Chinese Text Recognition with A Pre-Trained CLIP-Like Model Through   Image-IDS Aligning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01083)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How can we develop an effective Chinese text recognition system that can recognize both seen and unseen (zero-shot/few-shot) Chinese characters without requiring fine-tuning when new characters appear?The key points are:- The paper focuses on Chinese text recognition, which is more challenging than Latin text recognition due to the large number of classes and complex structures of Chinese characters. This leads to issues with recognizing zero-shot and few-shot characters.- Most previous methods for Chinese text recognition require fine-tuning on an updated alphabet/character set when new characters appear. This is inconvenient for practical applications.- The authors propose a two-stage framework to address this issue, inspired by how humans recognize Chinese text. The key idea is to first pre-train a model to learn canonical representations of characters, and then use those representations to recognize text through image-text matching.- This approach allows recognizing zero-shot and few-shot characters without fine-tuning, unlike previous methods, by matching them to their learned canonical representations.So in summary, the central research question is how to develop an effective Chinese text recognition method that can handle zero-shot/few-shot characters without needing to be re-trained, which is addressed through learning canonical character representations and image-text matching.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a two-stage framework for Chinese text recognition, consisting of a CCR-CLIP pre-training stage and a CTR stage. The main contributions are:- It proposes a CCR-CLIP model that learns canonical representations of Chinese characters by aligning printed character images and Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS) in an embedding space. This simulates how humans learn to recognize characters.- The learned canonical representations are used to supervise a conventional encoder-decoder CTR model. This allows recognizing zero-shot characters without fine-tuning when new characters appear. - The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Chinese character recognition and Chinese text recognition benchmarks. Specifically, it can robustly recognize zero-shot characters, outperforming previous methods that require fine-tuning with an updated alphabet when new classes appear.- The two-stage framework draws inspiration from how humans recognize Chinese text - by first learning standard character forms and then matching text to these learned representations. This allows recognizing even unseen characters, similar to human learning.In summary, the key innovation is the CCR-CLIP pre-training to obtain canonical representations of characters, which then enables zero-shot recognition in the CTR stage. The overall framework simulates human learning for Chinese text recognition.
