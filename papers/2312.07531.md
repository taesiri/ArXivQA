 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces WHAM, a new method for efficiently and accurately reconstructing 3D human motion and global trajectory from monocular video captured by a moving camera. WHAM first learns to lift 2D keypoint sequences to 3D poses using motion capture data and then fuses this motion context with image features over time to produce accurate pose and shape estimates. To recover the global trajectory, WHAM leverages the camera's angular velocity along with predictions of body orientation, velocity, and foot contact. Foot contact helps resolve issues like foot sliding when the terrain is non-planar. Through extensive experiments, WHAM demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple in-the-wild benchmarks for both per-frame 3D pose/shape and the global trajectory while running efficiently at over 200 fps (excluding preprocessing steps). The method's speed and accuracy could enable real-time markerless motion capture for applications in gaming, AR/VR, robotics, and more. Limitations include reliance on foot contact, accumulation of drift over long sequences, and generalization challenges for rare motions not seen during training.
