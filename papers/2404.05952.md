# [Robot Safe Planning In Dynamic Environments Based On Model Predictive   Control Using Control Barrier Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05952)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Implementing obstacle avoidance for robots in dynamic environments is challenging. Model predictive control (MPC) combined with control barrier functions (CBF) is a popular approach, where CBF acts as constraints to guarantee safety. However, applying CBF constraints over the entire prediction horizon can lead to infeasibility issues, resulting in failures in finding optimal solutions. This reduces navigation efficiency of the robot.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new MPC framework that transforms the CBF hard constraints into soft constraints added to the cost function and introduces slack variables to penalize violations. This ensures feasibility of the optimization problem. Additionally, they employ a single-step dynamic generalized CBF (D-GCBF) constraint based on the relative degree of the CBF to enhance safety. 

The key ideas are:
1) Convert CBF hard constraints to soft constraints to guarantee feasibility and prompt the robot to actively explore new collision-free paths when stuck.
2) Incorporate D-GCBF as a one-step hard constraint to provide safety guarantees. D-GCBF is less strict than enforcing CBF over multiple steps.

Contributions:
- A novel MPC scheme with CBF soft constraints and D-GCBF hard constraint that ensures feasibility while enhancing safety and navigation efficiency.
- Theoretical analysis on exact penalty condition for equivalence of hard and soft constrained solutions, and safety guarantees of D-GCBF.
- Simulations with double-integrator and unicycle models validating improved performance over baseline methods.
- Real world experiments on a MR1000 robot demonstrating feasibility of deploying the approach.

In summary, the key novelty is the combined use of soft CBF constraints and D-GCBF hard constraint in MPC to achieve efficient and safe robot navigation in complex dynamic environments. Both simulation and real-world results demonstrate the effectiveness.
