# [Recurrent Drafter for Fast Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09919)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from slow inference speed due to their auto-regressive token-by-token text generation. This is exacerbated by hardware constraints related to memory bandwidth.
- Recently, speculative decoding has been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by using a smaller "draft" model to quickly propose candidate tokens that are then verified by the larger target LLM.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Recurrent Drafter approach that adopts a single-model strategy for speculative decoding, unlike prior works that use separate draft models.  
- It has a lightweight draft head with recurrent connections inspired by RNNs, allowing beam search to filter low-quality candidates before target model verification.
- An efficient dynamic tree attention algorithm is introduced to compress shared prefixes in beam search results without needing a predefined tree structure.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first single-model speculative decoder with a recurrent draft head to simplify the design.
- Enables direct beam search due to the recurrent structure to filter candidates.
- Introduces a dynamic tree attention method that efficiently compresses candidates based on beam search results.
- Empirically demonstrates improved efficiency over the state-of-the-art Medusa method, with over 3x speedup on large LLMs without quality loss.
- Provides detailed analysis on the trade-offs of model complexity, acceptance algorithms, and shares insights on practical deployment.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing speculative decoding research by proposing a novel single-model recurrent drafter approach that combines simplicity and effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a recurrent drafter approach for efficient speculative decoding of large language models, using a lightweight recurrent draft head to generate candidate tokens that are verified by the target model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing an improved approach for speculative decoding of large language models called the "recurrent drafter" (ReDrafter). The key aspects of the recurrent drafter include:

- It adopts a single-model strategy like Medusa, but uses a lightweight draft head with recurrent dependencies inspired by RNN language models. This simplifies the design while still being effective.

- The recurrent connections allow using beam search to filter out low-quality candidate token sequences, reducing the number of sequences that need to be verified by the target model.

- An efficient dynamic tree attention algorithm is presented to compress shared prefixes in the beam search results. This further reduces computation compared to predetermined static tree structures.

- Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed recurrent drafter. It can achieve higher speedups compared to prior methods like Medusa, while maintaining quality.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing an improved single-model speculative decoding approach called the recurrent drafter, which is faster, simpler and equally effective compared to previous methods.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Speculative decoding - The overall framework and approach for accelerating inference in large language models that the paper aims to improve. 

- Recurrent drafter - The proposed method in the paper, which uses a recurrent design for the draft head to simplify the inference process.

- Single-model approach - The paper adopts a single-model strategy for speculative decoding, unlike some prior works that use separate models.

- Beam search - The recurrent design of the drafter allows the use of beam search to filter candidate tokens.

- Dynamic tree attention - An efficient tree attention algorithm proposed in the paper that relies on beam search results rather than a predefined structure.

- Inference acceleration - The key goal of the methods explored is to improve the speed and efficiency of inference for large language models.

So in summary, the key concepts cover the proposed recurrent drafter method, beam search and dynamic tree attention optimizations, and the overall goal of faster inference for large language models under the speculative decoding framework.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the recurrent drafter method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that the recurrent drafter design draws inspirations from RNN language models. Can you elaborate on the specific aspects that were inspired by RNNs and how they were incorporated into the drafter? 

2. Beam search is used to filter out low-quality candidate sequences before verification by the target model. What are the trade-offs in using beam search compared to generating an exponentially large set of candidates like in Medusa?

3. The dynamic tree attention algorithm seems critical for efficiently managing larger beam sizes. Can you walk through the key ideas behind this algorithm and why a tensor-based approach was most suitable? 

4. The paper argues that relying on a validation set to construct the tree attention in Medusa may inadvertently impact individual sequence performance. Do you think this is a valid concern? How does the recurrent drafter approach address this?

5. One limitation mentioned is that beam search introduces some sequential overhead. Do you think methods like parallelized beam search could help mitigate this? What complications might arise in implementing something like that?

6. For the training process, what motivated the decision to use a simple, one-layer RNN model versus more complex RNN architectures? What impact would using a more complex RNN have?

7. The paper demonstrated how incorporating RNN improves drafter accuracy but also slows down inference. In practical deployment, how would you decide on the right balance between accuracy and speed?

8. Typical acceptance is shown to sometimes underperform rejection sampling at higher temperatures. Can you expand on what causes this discrepancy and how it could be addressed? 

9. The results show greater acceleration for Vicuna 13B versus 7B when using the recurrent drafter. Why do you think larger LM models see a bigger benefit from this approach?

10. The paper focuses on frozen target models, but mentions joint training as future work. What complications need to be considered with fine-tuning the target model versus keeping it fixed?
