# [Recurrent Drafter for Fast Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09919)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from slow inference speed due to their auto-regressive token-by-token text generation. This is exacerbated by hardware constraints related to memory bandwidth.
- Recently, speculative decoding has been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by using a smaller "draft" model to quickly propose candidate tokens that are then verified by the larger target LLM.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Recurrent Drafter approach that adopts a single-model strategy for speculative decoding, unlike prior works that use separate draft models.  
- It has a lightweight draft head with recurrent connections inspired by RNNs, allowing beam search to filter low-quality candidates before target model verification.
- An efficient dynamic tree attention algorithm is introduced to compress shared prefixes in beam search results without needing a predefined tree structure.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first single-model speculative decoder with a recurrent draft head to simplify the design.
- Enables direct beam search due to the recurrent structure to filter candidates.
- Introduces a dynamic tree attention method that efficiently compresses candidates based on beam search results.
- Empirically demonstrates improved efficiency over the state-of-the-art Medusa method, with over 3x speedup on large LLMs without quality loss.
- Provides detailed analysis on the trade-offs of model complexity, acceptance algorithms, and shares insights on practical deployment.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing speculative decoding research by proposing a novel single-model recurrent drafter approach that combines simplicity and effectiveness.
