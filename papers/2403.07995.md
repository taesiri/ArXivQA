# [Motifs, Phrases, and Beyond: The Modelling of Structure in Symbolic   Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07995)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of techniques for modeling musical structure in AI systems that generate symbolic music compositions. It focuses on works aiming to improve long-term coherence and global form. 

The paper first covers early symbolic approaches before the rise of deep learning, including Markov models, constraint programming, optimization methods, and genetic algorithms. These systems relied on handcrafted rules and patterns extracted from specific template pieces to guide structured generation. However, they were limited in scalability and flexibility across diverse datasets.  

The paper then examines foundational and transformative deep learning models since 2016 for symbolic music generation with structure. Early models like Lookback RNN and Attention RNN used mechanisms to bias towards repeated patterns. More recent transformer-based approaches leverage relative attention, hierarchical representations, efficiency techniques for long sequences, and pre-training to better capture motifs, repetitions, and global structure. However, modeling nuanced development of themes over time remains difficult.

The paper introduces an emerging "subtask decomposition" technique that breaks down music generation into separate high-level structural planning and content creation stages. First, a plan outlining repetitions, sequences, or a melodic skeleton is constructed. Then, the musical content is generated conditioned on adhering to this structural framework. This separation of modeling hierarchy and details shows promise in improving global coherence. 

Finally, the paper discusses key limitations of current methods in mastering advanced compositional techniques involving sophisticated motif development, variations and transformations across extended compositions. It outlines future directions such as exploring phrase-level representations, integrating insights from music cognition into evaluation protocols, and further developing top-down hierarchical plan-then-generate frameworks.

Overall, the review offers an insightful analysis on the evolution of structure modeling in AI music generation, highlighting progress as well as persistent challenges in achieving long-term coherence on par with human composers. It points to the synergistic potential of unified neuro-symbolic approaches in this quest.
