# [Skill Set Optimization: Reinforcing Language Model Behavior via   Transferable Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for sequential decision making in interactive environments like games, robotics, etc. However, improving their policies over time via reinforcement learning is computationally prohibitive or impossible. 
- Existing in-context learning methods for LLMs do not work well for long sequential tasks with delayed rewards. 
- Prior methods to leverage environment rewards for LLM policy improvement have limitations in continuity, task transferability, subgoal identification, etc.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Skill Set Optimization (SSO), a method to construct and refine skills to provide in-context to an LLM actor for continual policy improvement. 
- A skill contains a subgoal state and instructions for reaching that subgoal. Multiple similar rewarded subtrajectories are extracted to create each abstract skill.
- The skill set is constructed by extracting, scoring, sampling, and generating skills from new trajectories. It is refined by pruning poorly performing skills over time.
- Relevant skills are provided in-context to the LLM actor to reinforce useful behaviors.

Main Contributions:
- First method to continually construct and refine a set of skills for in-context LLM policy improvement using environment rewards.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on text game ScienceWorld by 35% over prior best method. Also shows strong performance on navigation game NetHack.
- Analysis shows SSO identifies increasingly useful skills over time that lead to higher rewards.
- Demonstrates using transferable skills for continual LLM adaptation and generalization across tasks.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach for in-context reinforcement of LLM policies via abstract skill set optimization, with empirical evidence of its advantages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Skill Set Optimization (SSO), a method to continually construct and refine skills (subgoals with instructions) from agent trajectories to provide in-context to a language model policy for continual reinforcement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing Skill Set Optimization (SSO), a method for improving large language model (LLM) actor performance through constructing and refining sets of transferable skills. Specifically:

- SSO constructs skills by extracting common high-reward subtrajectories from past experience, and generating abstract subgoals and instructions to represent each skill. These skills are provided in-context to the LLM actor to reinforce helpful behaviors.

- SSO further refines the skill set by pruning skills that do not continue to result in high rewards when executed. This continually optimizes the skill set.

- The skills aim to be transferable between tasks. Using multiple similar subtrajectories to construct each skill results in more abstract and generalizable skills.

- SSO is evaluated in text and gridworld sequential decision making environments (ScienceWorld and NetHack). It shows improved adaptation and transfer over baselines, achieving state-of-the-art on ScienceWorld.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing SSO as a method for in-context policy improvement of LLM actors by constructing, refining and transferring skills based on environment rewards.

The paper proposes a method called "Skill Set Optimization" (SSO) to improve language model performance in interactive environments by constructing and refining sets of transferable skills represented as subgoals and instructions. Key ideas include using in-context learning rather than fine-tuning for policy improvement, extracting skills from past trajectories, scoring and sampling skill candidates, generating abstract and transferable skills, and continually evaluating and pruning the skill set. Evaluations are done in text environments like ScienceWorld and grid environments like NetHack to demonstrate SSO's ability to enable adaptation, transfer, and continual improvement.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes learning skills by extracting common subtrajectories from past experience. However, in environments with low-level actions, similar subgoals could be achieved with very different action sequences. How does the method deal with this challenge? Does using state/action embeddings for similarity matching help address this?

2) The skill scoring function uses a weighted sum of similarity, reward, and length. How sensitive is the performance of the method to changes in these weights? Was any analysis done to understand the impact of these hyperparameters? 

3) The paper generates skills using the actor LLM itself. How reliable was the LLM at generating useful skills? Were there cases where the LLM-generated skills had to be manually corrected or were unclear? 

4) When retrieving skills to provide in-context, cosine similarity between the current state and skill initial states is used. However, the initial skill state may not fully capture the context in which that skill is applicable. Were any other more robust skill retrieval mechanisms explored?

5) The method seems to learn an increasingly better set of skills over iterations. Was any analysis done to quantify the improvement in skills over time? Are skills from later iterations executed more often or result in higher rewards?

6) How does the number of skills retrieved per step impact overall performance? Is there a sweet spot, or does increasing the number monotonically improve results? Does too high a number negatively impact planning time?

7) The paper compares the method to a fewshot baseline by providing full trajectories in-context. How do the lengths of provided contexts compare between the skills and fewshot approaches? Could fewshot also be made more memory-efficient?

8) Can providing unsuccessful trajectories to construct skills also be helpful? The paper currently only uses successful ones. Are there ways to leverage failures to extract helpful skills too?

9) The method relies on the actor LLM to self-report when it executes a skill. The paper mentions 70% accuracy on this. How do results vary with reporting accuracy? Can it be further improved?

10) The method is model-agnostic and evaluates with GPT variants. How well does it transfer to other LLMs like Codex or models with different architectures like retrieval models? Are certain model properties more amendable to this approach?
