# [Pretrained Visual Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16569)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Pretrained Visual Uncertainties":

Problem:
- Uncertainty quantification is important for trustworthy machine learning models, but uncertainties typically have to be learned from scratch for each new task. This is cumbersome for practitioners.
- Prior work has developed "feed-forward" uncertainty methods that add a small auxiliary head to existing models to predict uncertainties. However, they come with tradeoffs around non-interference, generalization, flexibility, overhead, and optimization stability that limit their scalability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper enhances an existing feed-forward method called "loss prediction" to overcome its limitations around gradient conflict and non-scalable training. 
- Specifically, they add a stopgrad to prevent the uncertainty head from interfering with the main model, cache representations to accelerate training by 180x, use a scale-free ranking loss, and scale up the pretraining data and model size.

Main Contributions:
- Develops the first general pretrained uncertainty modules for computer vision that transfer zero-shot to new tasks/datasets.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the URL benchmark for uncertainty transfer. 
- Demonstrates that the learned uncertainties capture aleatoric uncertainty in a dataset/task-agnostic way.
- Showcases applications in safe retrieval and visualization using the pretrained uncertainties.
- Provides pretrained checkpoints and efficient code to facilitate adoption.

In summary, this is the first work to show that task/dataset-independent uncertainties can be pretrained on large datasets like ImageNet-21k then added to vision models to make predictions more safe and reliable in unseen domains. This is an important step towards making uncertainty quantification easy and practical.
