# [Guided Reconstruction with Conditioned Diffusion Models for Unsupervised   Anomaly Detection in Brain MRIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04215)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called context-conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models (cDDPMs) for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans. The key idea is to train a DDPM to reconstruct healthy brain anatomy and incorporate additional feature information from the original input MRI scan to guide the reconstruction process. An image encoder network extracts a latent feature representation of the noise-free input which captures intensity and shape information. This latent code conditions the denoising process of the DDPM by transforming the internal feature maps to align intensities between input and reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this conditioning approach enables more accurate modeling of intensity distributions, improved domain adaptation capabilities, and overall enhanced anomaly detection performance across multiple pathology datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. The method effectively balances reconstructing healthy anatomy while preventing reconstruction of anomalies, leading to crisp residual maps that highlight abnormalities. By addressing limitations of reconstruction quality and domain shift, the proposed cDDPMs advance the capability for precise zero-shot identification of diverse lesions and tumors in MRI scans without costly annotation.
