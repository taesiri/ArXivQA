- It incorporates an automated machine learning pipeline for predictive modeling, forming an optimization cycle especially advantageous for optimizing machine configurations.  
- Prompt engineering involving a GPT-4 based feedback loop is utilized to create high-quality prompts for the Vicu単a LLM.

Main Contributions:
- Presents a comprehensive approach and framework for utilizing LLMs for tabular data analysis to enable non-specialists to engage in advanced analytics.
- Integrates AutoML for identifying optimal targets and building predictive models to enhance configurations.  
- Showcases prompt engineering methodology leveraging GPT-4 for optimizing Vicu単a prompts.
- Validates efficacy and adaptability of JarviX through practical use cases in manufacturing and business analytics.

In summary, JarviX is an end-to-end platform enabling automated advanced tabular data analysis using LLMs and AutoML, providing structured guidance to non-expert users. Its efficiency is demonstrated through real-world case studies.
