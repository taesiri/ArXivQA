# [Self-Supervised Multi-Frame Neural Scene Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing learning-based point cloud scene flow methods fail to generalize to large-scale autonomous driving datasets like Waymo Open and Argoverse due to overfitting on synthetic datasets. 
- In contrast, optimization-based methods like Neural Scene Flow Prior (NSFP) show great generalization ability but lack theoretical analysis on why they perform well. 
- No prior work has exploited temporal information across frames to improve two-frame scene flow estimation.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct theoretical analysis of NSFP using uniform stability framework, revealing its generalization error decreases as number of point clouds increases. This explains its effectiveness on large datasets.
- Propose a multi-frame scene flow estimation scheme with forward model, backward model, motion model and fusion model to exploit valuable temporal information.
- Theoretically analyze proposed method to show its generalization error bound does not increase with added frames, maintaining strong generalizability.

Main Contributions:
- First theoretical analysis of NSFP's generalization ability, explaining its effectiveness on large point clouds.
- A simple yet effective multi-frame scheme that utilizes temporal information to improve two-frame scene flow.
- Theoretical proof that adding frames does not hurt proposed method's generalizability.
- State-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open and Argoverse datasets, with robustness to fast motions.

In summary, this paper provides valuable theoretical insights into optimization-based scene flow methods, and proposes a novel way to exploit multi-frame information that outperforms existing approaches on real-world autonomous driving datasets.
