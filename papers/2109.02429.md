# [Learning Neural Causal Models with Active Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02429)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes a method for learning causal models with neural networks from a combination of observational and interventional data. - The main research question is how to actively and adaptively select the best interventions to perform in order to efficiently learn the underlying causal structure.- The paper introduces an "Active Intervention Targeting" (AIT) method to select the most informative interventions during the learning process. - AIT computes a score for each possible intervention target indicating how informative intervening on that target would be. It then selects the target with the highest score to intervene on next.- The score is based on measuring the discrepancy between hypothetical post-intervention samples drawn from different candidate causal graphs. High discrepancy suggests high uncertainty about the relationships around that target.- AIT can be integrated into neural network frameworks for causal discovery like SDI and DCDI to guide the interventional experiments.- Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, AIT is shown to improve sample efficiency and identification of the true causal graph compared to random intervention selection.In summary, the key hypothesis is that actively targeting interventions using a discrepancy-based score will enable more efficient learning of neural network causal models from interventional data. The paper provides empirical validation of this hypothesis.
