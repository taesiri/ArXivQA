# [Evaluating the Application of Large Language Models to Generate Feedback   in Programming Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09744)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Providing timely feedback on programming assignments is challenging for teachers due to the large number of students and exercises. This can negatively impact learning.
- Existing automated feedback tools have limitations and the potential of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 for providing feedback on code has not been fully explored.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors developed a web application called Tutor Kai that allows students to complete programming assignments and request automated feedback from GPT-4.
- Carefully designed prompts were used to provide context and guidelines to GPT-4 to generate helpful feedback without revealing solutions.
- 51 students used Tutor Kai over one semester and rated the automatically generated feedback.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrated that with a complex prompt, GPT-4 can identify most code issues (87%) and provide helpful feedback without including full solutions.
- Showed GPT-4 feedback received an average rating of 5.05 out of 7 from students.
- Identified challenges like contradictory test cases leading GPT-4 to "hallucinate" non-existent issues that need to be addressed.
- Laid groundwork for further research into optimizing prompts and models to enhance programming education with LLMs.

In summary, the paper explores using GPT-4 to automatically generate programming feedback for students and provides an initial promising evaluation, while also highlighting areas needing improvement. Key next steps are developing better prompts and evaluating more advanced LLMs as they are released.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This study investigates the application of GPT-4 to provide automated feedback on programming tasks for students in an introductory computer science course, finding that it was able to effectively identify issues in code submissions most of the time, though some incorrect suggestions indicate need for improvement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper presents the design and evaluation of a web application called Tutor Kai that integrates the large language model GPT-4 to generate feedback on student solutions for programming tasks. Specifically, it investigates to what extent GPT-4 is able to provide useful feedback in the context of programming education. 

The key results and contributions are:

- The development of Tutor Kai, a web-based programming practice environment that compiles code, runs tests, and leverages GPT-4 to generate personalized feedback for students.

- An evaluation methodology for analyzing the quality of the automated feedback along several dimensions like identification of issues, incorrect suggestions, etc.

- An analysis of feedback data collected from 51 students over 26 programming tasks during one semester. This includes both expert evaluations of the feedback quality as well as ratings provided by students.

- Key findings showing GPT-4 was able to identify most code issues (87%) but still struggled with some incorrect suggestions (12%) and hallucinated issues (6%). Students rated the feedback an average of 5.05 out of 7.

Overall, the paper demonstrates the promise of LLMs for automated feedback generation in programming education, while also highlighting areas needing improvement. The Tutor Kai platform and evaluation framework provide a foundation for further research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- GPT-4
- Automated feedback generation
- Programming education
- Code errors
- Incorrect suggestions
- Hallucinated issues
- Prompting strategies
- Student evaluations
- Future improvements

The paper focuses on using GPT-4 to automatically generate feedback for students working on programming exercises, with the goal of enhancing programming education. It evaluates the application through an analysis of the feedback quality and ratings provided by students over the course of a semester. The key findings relate to the extent to which the LLM-generated feedback was able to effectively identify actual code issues, while also discussing remaining challenges around incorrect suggestions and nonexistent, hallucinated problems. The implications point toward opportunities for further improvements through more advanced prompting strategies and future LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using GPT-4 model gpt-4-0314 for generating feedback. What are some key advantages and disadvantages of using this specific model versus other available GPT-4 models like gpt-4-turbo? How might the choice of model impact the quality and usefulness of the generated feedback?

2. The prompt design seems critical for steering the model to provide useful feedback without code. What prompt elements were most effective at achieving this? How might the prompt be further improved to generate even better feedback? 

3. Only the atomic feedback messages were evaluated in the paper. What value could evaluating the feedback sequence for each student submission provide? What methodology could be used to conduct such an analysis?

4. The paper identifies issues with student avoidance of the required feedback rating. What alternative evaluation methods could be used to gather high quality feedback ratings without disrupting student workflow? 

5. Could the feedback generation method be applied successfully to other coding languages beyond Python and Java? What adjustments might be required for languages like C++ or Javascript?

6. How well would this method work for more complex programming assignments? At what point might the quality of the generated feedback deteriorate? 

7. The paper identifies contradictory test data leading to hallucinated feedback issues. How prevalent do you think this problem could be? What steps could be taken to safeguard against bad test data undermining the feedback generation?

8. Do you think students would become over reliant on the generated feedback as a crutch? How could the tool be designed to encourage developing analytical skills?

9. The feedback generation is targeted at novice programmers. Do you think this method could be effective for intermediate or advanced student programmers? What limitations might exist?

10. The paper focuses on generating feedback for coding errors. Could this method be extended to provide useful feedback on program design decisions and style best practices? What challenges might exist in broadening the scope that way?
