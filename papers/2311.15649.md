# [RoboGPT: an intelligent agent of making embodied long-term decisions for   daily instruction tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15649)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes RoboGPT, an intelligent agent for making embodied long-term decisions to accomplish daily instruction tasks. RoboGPT has two main components: 1) An LLM-based planner called RoboGPT that is fine-tuned on a new dataset of 67k daily robot commands to integrate world knowledge from LLMs with robotics expertise. RoboGPT can handle complex tasks with long-term dependencies, even finding invisible objects inside containers. 2) A Re-Plan module that aligns objects in instructions to equivalent objects in the environment, addressing challenges due to naming diversity. Experiments show RoboGPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Prompter and LLM-Planner in task planning accuracy and generalization, including unseen task categories. The complete RoboGPT agent also achieves the best performance on ALFRED benchmarks. Key innovations include collecting a large-scale robot planning dataset, enhancing LLMs with robotics knowledge for logical and feasible planning, and enabling dynamic replanning to match instructions to the environment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a RoboGPT agent with a LLM-based planner enhanced by a new robotic dataset and replanning module to address long-term decision making and nomenclature diversity challenges in completing complex daily instruction tasks for robots.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a LLMs-based planner, RoboGPT, which combines the common sense of LLMs with robotics expertise knowledge through fine-tuning on a new robotic dataset. RoboGPT can plan complex daily tasks with long-term decisions.

2. Developing a Re-Plan module to adapt the planning to the environment, addressing the nomenclature diversity challenge in instruction tasks. The Re-Plan module achieves this by finding similar alternative objects if a sub-goal object cannot be aligned with what's in the environment. 

3. Improving navigation and manipulation abilities of the RoboSkill module by integrating a more accurate perception model based on Fast SAM. This enhances the accuracy of semantic mapping and supports better re-planning.

4. Demonstrating superior performance of the overall RoboGPT agent compared to state-of-the-art methods on both the ALFRED benchmark and tasks involving generalization beyond the standard 7 categories. The agent is shown to be more intelligent in understanding tasks, including handling prefix content, object quantities, dependencies, and long-term decisions.

In summary, the key innovation is in enhancing LLMs-based planning for robots with a specialized dataset and re-planning process to make it more feasible and aligned with real world environments and objects. This results in improved performance on daily instruction tasks.
