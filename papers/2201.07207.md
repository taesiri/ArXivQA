# [Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners: Extracting Actionable Knowledge   for Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07207)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate goal-driven action plans that are executable in interactive environments, without any additional training of the models. 

The key hypothesis is that sufficiently large LLMs pre-trained on large amounts of text data already contain a substantial amount of world knowledge that can be extracted and grounded in embodied agents and environments. Specifically, the authors investigate whether this world knowledge can be used by the LLMs to decompose high-level tasks expressed in natural language (e.g. "make breakfast") into executable action plans (e.g. "open fridge", "grab milk", etc.) that accomplish those tasks in a simulated household environment.

The paper shows that indeed, large LLMs like GPT-3 and Codex can produce plausible action plans when prompted appropriately, without any further training on action sequences. However, the plans often contain ambiguities or inaccuracies that make them not directly executable. The paper then proposes techniques to improve the executability of the LLM-generated plans by leveraging the world knowledge already within the models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that world knowledge for generating goal-oriented action plans is already present in sufficiently large LLMs, and techniques can be developed to extract this knowledge and ground it in an interactive embodied environment without additional training of the models. The paper presents evidence to support this hypothesis.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the central research question is whether world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) can be used to act in interactive environments. 

Specifically, the authors investigate whether knowledge about how to perform high-level tasks (like "make breakfast") can be expanded into a concrete series of executable actions (like "open fridge", "grab milk", etc.) using LLMs without any additional training. 

The key hypothesis appears to be that if pre-trained LLMs are large enough and prompted appropriately, they can effectively decompose high-level tasks into mid-level action plans without needing any further training on a dataset of demonstrations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Showing that large pre-trained language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and Codex can generate plausible, goal-driven action plans when prompted with a high-level task, without any additional training.

- Proposing techniques to improve the executability of the action plans generated by LLMs, including:
  - Translating the LLM's free-form text into admissible actions using a separate LLM.
  - Iteratively generating and correcting actions to stay anchored to what's executable.
  - Providing the LLM more suitable prompt examples to bias generation.
  
- Conducting an evaluation in the VirtualHome environment showing the proposed techniques can significantly improve executability of the LLM-generated plans, from 18% to 79%, albeit at some cost to semantic correctness.

- Providing a human evaluation of the trade-offs between executability and correctness for different models and techniques.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be exploring and evaluating the ability of large pre-trained LLMs to generate goal-oriented action plans, and developing methods to improve the executability of those plans for interactive embodied agents. The results seem to indicate LLMs have promising capabilities in this area, but also limitations around executability and grounding that need further work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on a quick skim, the main contribution of this paper seems to be:

- Showing that large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 and Codex contain world knowledge that can be used to generate plausible goal-driven action plans for completing high-level tasks, without any additional training. 

- Proposing techniques like semantic translation to map the free-form action phrases generated by the language model to executable actions in a simulated environment like VirtualHome. This improves the executability of the generated plans.

- Conducting a human evaluation on Mechanical Turk to assess the tradeoff between executability and semantic correctness of the generated plans using different models and techniques.

In summary, the key ideas appear to be leveraging the world knowledge already present in large language models to plan goal-driven actions, and developing inference-time techniques to map those actions to executable steps in an interactive embodied environment. The human evaluation provides insight into the tradeoffs between executability and correctness.

The paper shows promising results on extracting "actionable knowledge" from language models without additional training, although limitations remain around dropping correctness when improving executability. Overall it seems like an interesting investigation into grounding language models for embodied agents.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in natural language processing and machine learning for embodied AI:

- The key idea of extracting actionable knowledge from large pre-trained language models without any additional training is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on training models from scratch on domain-specific datasets or fine-tuning pre-trained models. This paper shows promising results can be obtained by simply prompting the models, which leverages knowledge already learned during pre-training.

- Evaluating the models on complex, open-ended human activities in VirtualHome is more realistic than much prior work that uses simpler synthetic tasks or restricted language templates. The free-form language specification and household environment pose new challenges.

- The paper introduces useful techniques like semantic translation and dynamic example selection to improve executability of the language model outputs, without invasive model modifications. These could likely help in other embodiments beyond VirtualHome.

- The human evaluation protocol to measure semantic correctness is necessary, since success on such open-ended tasks isn't straightforward to evaluate programmatically. This allows assessment of tradeoffs between correctness and executability.

- Compared to contemporaneous work by Li et al. 2022 which also evaluates language model capabilities in VirtualHome, this paper has the distinction of not doing any task-specific fine-tuning of the models. It demonstrates what can be done with just the pre-trained models.

Overall, I think this is a quite novel paper that shows the promising possibility of extracting actionable knowledge purely from large pre-trained language models, using retrieval and constrained generation techniques. The limitations discussed at the end are important to improve on in future work. Evaluating on complex human activities in a realistic environment also pushes forward embodied AI research.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here are some key observations about how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper focuses on investigating whether large language models (LLMs) contain actionable knowledge that can be used for planning and acting in interactive environments. Most prior work has focused on training models from scratch on step-by-step demonstrations or instructions. This paper takes a novel approach of probing the knowledge already contained within LLMs without additional training.

- The paper introduces a new testbed based on the VirtualHome environment for evaluating LLMs on decomposing high-level tasks into executable action plans. This provides a more realistic and open-ended evaluation compared to much prior work that uses simulated environments and templated tasks. 

- A key contribution is showing that large enough LLMs can produce surprisingly good action plans when prompted appropriately, despite no additional training. However, the plans often fail to be executable due to ambiguity. The paper proposes techniques to improve executability by leveraging semantic similarity metrics and environment action schemas.

- Compared to prior work on single-step knowledge extraction, this paper tackles the more challenging problem of extracting complete action plans. It also goes beyond extracting factual knowledge to extracting procedural knowledge about how to accomplish goals.

- The paper provides useful analysis about tradeoffs between semantic correctness versus environment executability when extracting plans from LLMs. This highlights both the knowledge already contained in LLMs and the challenges of grounding it.

In summary, this paper pushes forward research on probing and extracting knowledge from LLMs by tackling multi-step procedural knowledge in interactive environments. The analysis illuminates both surprising capabilities of large LLMs and areas needing further research to achieve fully executable and correct plans. The introduction of a more open-ended testbed is also a valuable contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing techniques to improve the executability of action plans generated by LLMs without sacrificing as much semantic correctness. The paper found a trade-off between executability and correctness when applying their proposed techniques. Further research could explore how to better balance these two objectives.

- Incorporating observation context and feedback into the models. The methods in the paper do not leverage any environment context or feedback. Allowing the models to condition on visual observations and trial-and-error experience could improve groundedness. 

- Exploring low-level sensorimotor grounding rather than only mid-level grounding of actions. The techniques focused on grounding mid-level actions like "open fridge" but did not look at low-level motor controls. Further work could investigate grounding LLMs all the way down to low-level behaviors.

- Evaluating the techniques on more dynamic, interactive environments beyond VirtualHome. While VirtualHome supports many complex activities, testing the methods in other embodied environments, including real-world robotics platforms, could reveal new challenges.

- Studying how conditional prompting/tuning of LLMs affects the models' intrinsic knowledge. The techniques used prompting and tuning to elicit knowledge, but how this impacts what knowledge the models express is still an open question.

- Developing metrics beyond executability and correctness to better evaluate generated plans. The paper acknowledged the challenges in assessing plan quality, so creating improved metrics is an area for future work.

- Exploring other techniques to extract actionable knowledge from LLMs without additional training. The paper presented promising initial techniques, but there is room to develop alternative approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions:

- Improving correctness of the generated action plans without sacrificing executability. They note that their method improves executability but at the cost of reduced correctness based on human evaluation. More work is needed to achieve human-level performance on generating plans that are both executable and correct. 

- Incorporating environment context and feedback into the models. Currently the models generate plans without observing the environment, so cannot handle tasks that require resolving ambiguity or adapting based on environment feedback. Integrating perception and closed-loop execution could make the models more generally capable.

- Going beyond mid-level grounding of actions to low-level sensorimotor grounding. The current work focuses on grounding high-level tasks to mid-level actions like "open fridge", but does not investigate grounding those to low-level controls. Further research on using LLMs for low-level sensorimotor behaviors like navigation and manipulation would be valuable.

- Addressing the limitations around evaluation protocol and metrics. The authors note difficulties in computational evaluation of correctness for open-ended tasks, and use a combination of human evaluation and proxy metrics. Developing more rigorous evaluation protocols and singular metrics is an open challenge.

- Exploringprompt tuning approaches to incorporate environment context into LLMs without invasive modifications. The authors mention this as a promising direction aligned with other recent work.

- Applying the approach to different interactive environments, including those beyond the household domain evaluated here. The authors expect the findings should transfer broadly but further experiments would be needed to confirm.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the trade-offs between executability and correctness, incorporating environmental grounding and feedback, integrating low-level sensorimotor behaviors, developing better evaluation methods, and testing the generality across diverse embodied environments.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate executable action plans for completing high-level tasks in interactive environments. The authors evaluate performance in the VirtualHome environment on a diverse set of daily human activities. They find that large pre-trained LLMs like GPT-3 and Codex can produce sensible action plans when prompted with an example demonstration, even without any additional training. However, these plans often contain ambiguities or unsupported actions that make them inexecutable in the environment. 

To address this, the authors propose techniques to translate the LLM's free-form plans into executable actions in the environment. This involves: 1) mapping phrases to admissible actions via sentence embeddings, 2) iteratively generating actions and translating them to stay grounded, and 3) providing better prompt examples. Using these techniques, they are able to substantially improve the executability of plans from the LLMs, albeit at some cost to semantic correctness. The results demonstrate both the knowledge already contained in large LLMs as well as the challenges in precisely grounding it. Further work is needed to achieve human-level performance on extracting actionable knowledge from LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an investigation into using large language models (LLMs) to generate executable action plans for goal-oriented tasks in interactive environments. The authors evaluate the recently proposed VirtualHome environment, which supports a diverse set of realistic human activities in a simulated household setting. They find that large pre-trained LLMs like GPT-3 and Codex can generate plausible high-level action plans when prompted with a natural language task description and an example plan. However, these plans are often not executable due to ambiguity or invalid actions. 

To address this, the authors propose techniques to map the LLM's outputs to valid environment actions and make corrections throughout plan generation. This includes using a separate LLM to find the closest valid action match and iteratively conditioning the next step on previous valid actions. Combining these techniques significantly improves the executability of the generated plans from 18\% to 79\% in VirtualHome. However, human evaluation reveals a trade-off between executability and semantic correctness. The work shows promise in extracting actionable knowledge from LLMs, but further improvements in grounding and fidelity are needed.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a method to extract actionable knowledge from large pre-trained language models to accomplish goals in interactive environments, without any additional training of the models. 

The key idea is to prompt a large causal language model (e.g. GPT-3) with a high-level task description and an example plan, to generate a sequence of action steps. To improve the executability of the generated plan, each action step is translated into the closest admissible action in the environment using a semantic similarity measure from a masked language model (e.g. RoBERTa). The translated admissible action is appended back to the prompt to guide subsequent action generation. Additionally, a similar task example is dynamically selected from demonstrations to provide weak supervision. 

In experiments on the VirtualHome environment, this approach is shown to significantly improve the executability of plans generated by large language models, without any parameter updates. The trade-off with plan correctness is analyzed. Overall, the method demonstrates the promise of extracting actionable knowledge from pre-trained language models for embodied agents.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates extracting actionable knowledge from large pre-trained language models (LLMs) without any additional training, for the purpose of generating feasible action plans to complete high-level embodied tasks. The authors first show that large causal LLMs like GPT-3 and Codex can generate plausible action plans when prompted with a high-level task description and example, but the plans are often not executable. To address this, they propose an inference-time procedure that translates the LLM-generated plans into executable actions through a separate masked LLM, selecting the most semantically similar admissible action. Their method also interleaves plan generation and action translation, allowing on-the-fly correction by conditioning on previous translated actions. Additionally, they select the most similar task/plan example from demonstrations to provide weak supervision to the LLM at test time. Through human evaluation, they demonstrate their proposed techniques can substantially improve the executability of plans generated by LLMs in the VirtualHome environment.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is whether world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) can be used to act in interactive embodied environments without any additional training. 

Specifically, the authors investigate whether knowledge about how to perform high-level tasks like "make breakfast" can be expanded into a series of executable actions like "open fridge", "grab milk", etc. that can actually be carried out by an agent in a simulated environment.

The key questions seem to be:

- Can LLMs produce sensible sequences of actions for accomplishing goals when prompted appropriately, without any further training?

- Are the action plans produced by LLMs directly executable in an interactive embodied environment or do they require some processing to make them executable?

- What techniques can help make the LLM-generated plans more executable while retaining their correctness?

So in summary, the core problem is grounding the world knowledge learned by LLMs into actionable plans that can be executed by agents in interactive environments, which requires addressing the challenges around executability and correctness of the LLM-generated plans.

So in summary, the main problem is grounding the world knowledge contained in LLMs to make it actionable in embodied agents and interactive environments, in order to accomplish high-level tasks. The authors aim to show this is possible without additional training of the LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes translating the natural language action phrases generated by the Planning LM into executable environment actions using a separate Translation LM. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using a separate model for translation versus having the Planning LM generate executable actions directly?

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using large pre-trained language models to generate action plans for high-level tasks without any additional training. Why do you think large models like GPT-3 and Codex contain sufficient knowledge to generate reasonable action plans with just a prompt? What aspects of the pre-training allow the models to have this capability?

2. The paper finds that the action plans generated by the language models are often not executable due to ambiguity or invalid actions. What types of knowledge gaps do you think the language models are missing that lead to these non-executable actions? How could the pre-training be improved to reduce these gaps?

3. The paper proposes techniques like semantic translation and iterative trajectory correction to make the generated plans more executable. Do you think these techniques could be improved by somehow incorporating environment feedback or demonstrations? How specifically could feedback be utilized?

4. The semantic translation uses a separate language model to map free-text actions to valid environment actions. Do you think this is necessary, or could executability be improved by just generating multiple options and scoring based on the original model? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The paper evaluates the method in a household environment simulator. Do you think the approach would transfer well to more complex domains like robotics? What challenges might arise in more unstructured environments?

6. The paper finds a tradeoff between executability and correctness as modifications are made to improve executability. How could this tradeoff be improved? Is there a way to enhance executability without sacrificing correctness?

7. Do you think the proposed techniques could enable real-time planning and replanning based on environment observations? What modifications would need to be made?

8. The paper does not fine-tune the language models, in order to evaluate their existing knowledge. Do you think fine-tuning could help, or would it damage the generative capabilities?

9. The evaluation relies on human judgment for correctness. Do you think an automated metric could be developed to assess semantic correctness, rather than just executability? What would this require?

10. The paper aims to extract actionable knowledge, but does not handle low-level control or visual perception. How difficult do you think it would be to extend the approach to handle lower-level grounding as well? Would the high-level plans generated be sufficient?
