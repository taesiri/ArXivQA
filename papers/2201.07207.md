# Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners: Extracting Actionable Knowledge   for Embodied Agents

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate goal-driven action plans that are executable in interactive environments, without any additional training of the models. Specifically, the paper investigates whether LLMs contain enough knowledge about how to perform high-level tasks (e.g. "make breakfast") that they can expand those tasks into grounded, mid-level action plans (e.g. "open fridge", "grab milk", etc.) that could actually be executed by an agent in an environment like VirtualHome.The key hypothesis appears to be that large enough LLMs, when prompted appropriately, can decompose high-level tasks into executable action plans using only the knowledge they were pre-trained on, without any further training on environment-specific data.The paper then proposes techniques to take the action plans produced by LLMs and make them more executable, as well as evaluating the tradeoff between executability and correctness of the resulting plans.In summary, the central research question is whether actionable knowledge for embodied agents can be extracted from pre-trained LLMs, using prompting techniques and without additional training. The hypothesis is that this is possible for large enough LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Showing that large pre-trained language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and Codex can generate plausible goal-driven action plans when prompted appropriately, without any additional training. - Proposing techniques to improve the executability of the action plans generated by LLMs in interactive environments, including:1) Mapping free-form actions to executable environment actions via semantic similarity. 2) Iteratively generating and correcting actions using the environment's admissible actions.3) Providing dynamic weak supervision by prompting with similar examples.- Evaluating these techniques in the VirtualHome environment and showing they can substantially improve executability of LLM-generated plans from 18% to 79%, albeit at some cost to semantic correctness.- Conducting a human evaluation to analyze the trade-off between executability and correctness when using LLMs for planning.In summary, the key contribution is showing the surprising capability of large LLMs to generate goal-driven plans when prompted properly, and providing methods to improve their executability in interactive environments without additional training. The paper analyzes the trade-offs and limitations of this approach through quantitative metrics and human evaluations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately without access to the full paper text, I do not have enough context to provide a meaningful summary. A paper's title and section headers alone are typically not sufficient to grasp the key points and contributions being made. If you could provide some more details from the paper content, I could attempt to summarize the main ideas.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of using language models for planning and embodied agents:- The core idea of extracting actionable knowledge from large pre-trained language models without any additional training or fine-tuning is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on training models from scratch on domain-specific datasets or fine-tuning large models, rather than tapping into knowledge already learned. - The paper thoroughly evaluates different language models across various sizes, including smaller models like GPT-2 up to huge models like GPT-3 and Codex. This allows them to show that model scale is important for generating higher quality and more complete action plans.- Using the VirtualHome environment to evaluate on complex, open-ended human activities is more realistic than some prior work that evaluates on more constrained simulated tasks. The human evaluation protocol is also more robust.- The proposed techniques like semantic translation to executable actions, iterative plan generation, and dynamic example selection are intuitive and leverage the core strengths of language models. The ablation studies demonstrate their importance.- Overall, the work seems very thorough in terms of evaluating multiple language models, proposing techniques tailored to them, analyzing the trade-offs, and highlighting limitations. The general finding that large pre-trained LMs contain useful actionable knowledge is quite exciting.- Compared to some related concurrent work like Li et al. 2022, this paper has the advantage of not fine-tuning the models, in order to specifically probe what's already embedded. But that paper takes steps like incorporating environment context that could be complementary.- There remain some open challenges around achieving better executability without sacrificing correctness. But this seems like an important first step toward extracting knowledge from LLMs for planning and agency.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:- Improving the correctness of the generated action plans while maintaining high executability. The paper notes there is currently a trade-off between these two objectives. Further research could aim to generate plans that are highly executable yet also semantically accurate.- Incorporating environment context and feedback into the models. Currently the methods do not condition the generated plans on observations or feedback from the environment. Allowing the model access to such information could potentially improve the quality of the plans.- Evaluating the methods on additional embodied environments, including those beyond household settings. The current investigation focuses on the VirtualHome environment, but the authors suggest the findings may generalize more broadly. Testing on other environments could validate this.  - Exploring low-level sensorimotor grounding, rather than just the mid-level grounding addressed in the paper. The current work looks at grounding high-level tasks to mid-level action sequences. Further research could investigate using language models for low-level control and interactions.- Incorporating the generated plans into full agent training pipelines, such as using them to guide exploration in reinforcement learning. The paper focuses on plan generation, but using these plans to train agents is noted as an exciting direction.- Addressing limitations around task expressivity and evaluation methodology. The authors discuss issues with the open-ended nature of the tasks and difficulties evaluating correctness. Advancing the frameworks to overcome these challenges is suggested.In summary, key directions include improving correctness, incorporating environmental context, testing generalization, low-level grounding, using plans for agent training, and addressing evaluation limitations. Overall the authors frame this as an promising yet early step towards extracting actionable knowledge from large language models.
