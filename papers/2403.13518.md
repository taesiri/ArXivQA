# [Motion Generation from Fine-grained Textual Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13518)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
- Existing text2motion models and datasets focus on coarse-grained motion descriptions, which limits the ability to generate precise motions from more detailed, fine-grained textual descriptions. This is a problem because real applications often require fine-grained details about movements of specific body parts. 

Proposed Solution
- Construct a new large-scale text2motion dataset called FineHumanML3D which contains fine-grained textual descriptions. To generate these, they carefully design prompts to expand the original coarse descriptions from HumanML3D using the GPT-3.5-turbo language model. The best prompt uses pseudo-code checks to elicit descriptions that are step-by-step, chronological, specify spatial changes, and conform to body constraints.

- Develop a new text2motion model called FineMotionDiffuse which incorporates both the new fine-grained descriptions and original coarse descriptions. This includes a fine-text encoder with step embeddings and self-attention to capture temporal order, a coarse-text encoder, and cross-attention followed by a diffusion model to generate motions.

Main Contributions
- Creation of the first large text2motion dataset focusing on high-quality fine-grained textual descriptions specifying detailed body part motions.

- Novel prompt engineering method and pseudo-code technique to effectively expand coarse descriptions into fine-grained ones automatically using LLMs.  

- Proposed FineMotionDiffuse model that takes advantage of both coarse and fine-grained descriptions, outperforming MotionDiffuse baseline on quantitative metrics and better handling unseen composite motions.

Overall, the key novelty is using prompt engineering and LLMs to create detailed text2motion data combined with a model that can leverage this to generate more precise motions from fine-grained language.
