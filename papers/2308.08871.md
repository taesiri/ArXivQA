# [Spatially and Spectrally Consistent Deep Functional Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08871)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the accuracy and consistency of deep functional maps for non-rigid shape matching, especially in the presence of large shape distortions. Specifically, the paper investigates using cycle consistency as a way to regularize deep functional maps during training to make them more robust. The key ideas are:- They provide a theoretical analysis showing that deep functional maps trained on shape pairs exhibit a form of spectral cycle consistency. - However, they identify that spectrally consistent maps are not necessarily spatially/point-wise consistent. - To address this, they propose a two-branch architecture to enforce both spectral and spatial cycle consistency during training. This is done by introducing a latent shape and jointly optimizing maps in both spectral and spatial domains.- Experiments show their method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging non-rigid shape matching tasks, especially under significant distortions. The two-branch architecture also improves generalization and reduces overfitting.In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging cycle consistency to make deep functional maps spectrally and spatially consistent will improve accuracy and robustness for non-rigid shape matching. The two-branch architecture is proposed to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It provides a theoretical analysis of the cycle consistency of deep functional maps (DFM). Specifically, it shows that under certain conditions, the learned maps are already cycle consistent in the spectral domain. 2. It identifies that spectrally consistent maps are not necessarily spatially/point-wise consistent. To address this, the paper proposes a novel two-branch unsupervised DFM framework that enforces consistency in both the spectral and spatial domains. 3. The key idea is to construct a latent shape by aligning the spectral embeddings of each shape. Point-wise maps are then computed in this canonical embedding domain to promote spatial consistency. Finally, these point-wise maps are converted to functional maps that agree with the spectral ones.4. Through extensive experiments on non-rigid shape matching benchmarks, the paper shows that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing DFM methods, especially in the presence of significant shape distortions. It also demonstrates improved generalization ability.5. The two-branch design can be incorporated into existing DFM frameworks with marginal computational overhead. Experiments show significant gains when plugged into an earlier DFM method.In summary, the key novelty of this work is the theoretical analysis of spectral consistency in DFM and the proposal of a simple yet effective two-branch framework to achieve both spectral and spatial consistency. This results in state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization on challenging non-rigid shape matching tasks.
