# [An Empirical Study on Using Large Language Models to Analyze Software   Supply Chain Security Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04898)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard to analyze historical software supply chain failures reported in news articles and blogs. The authors compared the LLMs' categorization of 69 failures from a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) catalog against manual analysis by researchers across dimensions like type of compromise, intent, nature, and impact. On average, GPT-3.5 had 68% accuracy while Bard had 58% in replicating the manual analysis. Accuracy was higher when there was consensus among human analysts. GPT-3.5's "lessons learned" for preventing future failures received reasonable ratings from researchers, with helpfulness scores around 4 out of 5. Overall, the study found LLMs can aid failure analysis when articles contain enough details, but cannot yet fully replace manual review. The authors suggest future work on improving LLM performance on this task and analyzing a broader range of articles and failures.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and Google's Bard at analyzing historical software supply chain security failures. The authors used a catalog of 69 manually analyzed failures from 1984-2022 as a baseline for comparison. They engineered prompts for the LLMs to extract information about the type, intent, nature, and impacts of each failure, as well as lessons learned. Overall, GPT-3.5 performed better than Bard, achieving 52-88% accuracy across the different dimensions compared to the manual analysis. GPT-3.5 was most accurate when there was consensus among the human analysts. The quality of the LLM outputs depended heavily on the level of detail in the source articles. While showing potential as an aid, the LLMs are not yet able to fully replace manual analysis of software supply chain failures. The authors recommend further development of LLMs specialized for this application and analysis of a broader range of failure reports.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of large language models like GPT-3.5 and Bard at replicating manual analysis and extracting lessons learned from software supply chain security failures, finding moderate performance that improves with more detailed failure reports.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on reviewing the content of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:

RQ1: How effective are LLMs (large language models) in replicating manual analysis of software supply chain failures?

RQ2: Do LLMs suggest viable mitigation strategies for preventing future failures?

The authors evaluate the ability of LLMs like ChatGPT and Google's Bard to analyze historical software supply chain breaches. They use the LLMs to try to replicate the manual analysis done by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) on 69 software supply chain security failures. The LLMs are prompted to categorize the failures along dimensions like type of compromise, intent, nature, and impact. Their accuracy at replicating the manual analysis is measured. The authors also assess whether the LLMs can provide reasonable and actionable lessons learned/mitigation strategies based on analyzing the failures. So in summary, the central questions focus on evaluating LLMs for analyzing software supply chain failures and providing mitigation suggestions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. An extended analysis of a catalog of 69 software supply chain failures from news articles and blogs. The failures were analyzed across several dimensions including type of compromise, intent, nature, impacts, and solutions/learnings. 

2. An evaluation of the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT and Google's Bard to replicate manual analysis of these failures. Prompts were engineered to get the LLMs to extract information like the type of compromise and impacts from the articles.  

3. A comparison of the LLMs' categorizations to the manual analysis done by members of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). On average, GPT had 68% accuracy across the dimensions while Bard had 58% accuracy.

4. An assessment of the quality of solutions and learnings extracted by GPT. The solutions were rated by human analysts for their appropriateness on a Likert scale. The mean score was 3.83/5.

5. An analysis of factors impacting LLM performance on this task. Performance was better when source articles were more detailed and when manual analysts reached consensus. The quality of LLM outputs depends heavily on the inputs.

In summary, the main contribution is an empirical study evaluating LLMs on replicating manual analysis of software supply chain failures using a catalog of historical incidents. The study provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs for automated failure analysis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of using natural language processing to analyze software supply chain failures:

- This paper focuses specifically on evaluating large language models (LLMs) like GPT and Bard for analyzing software supply chain failures. Much prior work has looked at using NLP for various software engineering tasks, but not specifically for supply chain failure analysis.

- The paper uses an existing catalog of 69 historical supply chain failures as a baseline for evaluation. Other related work has often constructed new datasets or used proprietary data. Using an existing public dataset allows for easier replication and comparison.

- The dimensions analyzed (type, intent, nature, impact) align with common failure analysis frameworks used in prior work. The paper extends analysis beyond just the type categorized in the original catalog.

- The overall approach of prompt engineering followed by quantitative evaluation of LLM accuracy is similar to much research applying LLMs to new tasks. However, this domain of supply chain analysis is novel.

- Compared to prior failure analysis studies that rely completely on manual expert analysis, this work explores automation with LLMs. But it still uses human raters to establish ground truth and evaluate LLM quality.

- The paper provides a rigorous empirical evaluation on a modest dataset. Future work could expand the dataset size, time period, and sources to further stress test LLMs on this task.

In summary, this paper provides an initial investigation of LLMs for a new task - supply chain failure analysis. It adapts common NLP and LLM evaluation methods to this novel domain. The results demonstrate promise but also limitations compared to purely manual analysis. More research is needed to determine if LLMs can match or exceed human-level performance on this complex analytical task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Improving the performance of LLMs in analyzing software supply chain failures by fine-tuning the models using baseline knowledge like the CNCF catalog, and applying them to future issues.

- Evaluating whether next-generation LLMs like GPT-4 would be suitable as aids or replacements for manual analysis of software supply chain failures.

- Broadening the analysis to include additional LLMs beyond GPT and Bard, such as Claude and Cohere. 

- Additional prompt engineering and tailoring prompts specifically for different LLMs to potentially improve accuracy.

- Extending the analysis to a wider range of articles and failures beyond the CNCF catalog, such as other open source reports and articles.

In summary, the main future work suggested is:

1) Improving LLM performance through techniques like fine-tuning

2) Evaluating more advanced LLM models 

3) Testing additional LLMs 

4) More prompt engineering

5) Analyzing a broader range of failure reports beyond the CNCF catalog

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors used Cohen's kappa to measure inter-rater agreement for labeling the dimensions of intent, nature, and impacts. What are some limitations of using Cohen's kappa for this purpose? How could the measurement of inter-rater agreement be improved?

2. Prompt engineering was conducted on only 20% of the dataset. What risks does this limited prompt engineering introduce? How could prompt engineering be done more rigorously for the entire dataset? 

3. The authors compared two LLMs - GPT and Bard. What other state-of-the-art LLMs could have been included in the comparison? What benefits or disadvantages might they have offered over GPT and Bard?

4. The authors evaluated the LLMs on only four dimensions - type, intent, nature, and impacts. What other dimensions could have been included to provide a more comprehensive evaluation? Why were only these four chosen?

5. The ground truth labels used for evaluation came only from the CNCF catalog and additional manual labeling. What other sources of ground truth could have been leveraged? How might this have impacted the measured accuracy?

6. The authors evaluated the quality of the LLMs' lessons learned using 5-point Likert scale ratings. What other measures could have been used to quantify the quality? How might those have offered different insights?

7. Only one trial was conducted for each LLM due to the consistent behavior of GPT and low rate limits of Bard. How could multiple trials have been incorporated to account for variability?

8. What kinds of bias were introduced by using the same prompts engineered for GPT with Bard? How could prompt engineering have been done separately for each LLM?

9. The catalog only contained 69 articles on software supply chain failures. How might performance change on a larger and more diverse dataset? What steps could expand the dataset?

10. Beyond accuracy, what other metrics could have been used to evaluate the LLMs? How might those metrics reveal different capabilities and limitations?
