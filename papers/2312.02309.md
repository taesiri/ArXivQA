# [Training Reinforcement Learning Agents and Humans With   Difficulty-Conditioned Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Prior unsupervised environment design (UED) methods for generating adaptive curricula have relied on surrogate objectives or co-learning, which may not directly address the zone of proximal development (ZPD). They also lack transferability between different types of students.

Solution:
The paper introduces Parameterized Environment Response Model (PERM), an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based generative model that can directly model difficulty and ability to align environment difficulty with student ability. This creates a ZPD-based curriculum. 

Key aspects of PERM:
- Applies IRT to model the relationship between student ability, environment difficulty, and student performance. Allows quantifying environment difficulty relative to student ability.
- Uses variational inference to learn latent representations of student ability and environment difficulty. Can then generate new environments at desired difficulty levels. 
- Assumes optimal learning happens when environment difficulty matches student ability. Allows operationalizing ZPD.

The paper presents a 2-stage training process exploiting PERM:

Stage 1: Use RL agents to gather student-environment interaction data to train PERM.
Stage 2: Deploy trained PERM as teacher algorithm to train students, including real human students.

Main Contributions:
1. Introduce PERM and demonstrate applicability to different learning contexts by adapting it to a 2D game environment.

2. Propose a two-stage training process to first use RL to collect data for PERM, then deploy PERM to train learners.

3. Empirically demonstrate PERM's effectiveness in training both RL agents and real human students. The first algorithm shown to have such transferability.
