# [Sparse-Graph-Enabled Formation Planning for Large-Scale Aerial Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17288)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing graph-based formation planning methods become computationally intractable for large-scale aerial swarms due to quadratic growth in complexity with number of drones. 
- Complete graphs are used to guarantee global rigidity for unique formation configuration, but lead to high complexity.
- Constructing a sparse yet globally rigid graph to capture structure of complete graphs remains an open problem.

Proposed Solution:
- Design a graph sparsification mechanism and prove the sparsified graph is globally rigid (necessary for formation planning).
- Transform sparse graph construction to a submatrix selection problem of the Laplacian matrix. Formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem.
- Introduce genetic algorithm and Max-Trace matrix-revealing metric to efficiently guide good submatrix selection that preserves structure of complete graphs.  

- Integrate constructed sparse graphs into formation planning to replace computationally demanding complete graphs.

Main Contributions:
1. Propose a graph sparsification mechanism and prove the sparsified graph is globally rigid.
2. Develop a good sparse graph construction method via submatrix selection that captures main features of complete graphs.
3. Demonstrate integration into formation planning and show order of magnitude improvement in efficiency with acceptable sacrifice in performance compared to complete graphs through simulations.

In summary, the paper develops a method to efficiently construct sparse yet globally rigid graphs that can preserve structure of complete graphs for graph-based formation planning of large-scale aerial swarms. This leads to significant gains in computational efficiency with reasonable tradeoffs in performance.
