# [Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning Through Adversarial Attacks and   Training : A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00420)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the topic of robustness in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and the use of adversarial attacks and training to enhance robustness. 

The paper first introduces the background and motivation behind studying robustness in DRL. It points out that despite the significant advances of DRL across domains like games and robotics, DRL agents remain susceptible to minor changes in conditions or perturbations not seen during training. This poses challenges for real-world deployment where reliability is critical. The paper frames the concept of robustness - an agent's ability to maintain performance despite changes in conditions. 

The paper then formally defines the robustness problem in DRL using the framework of distributionally robust optimization. It considers worst-case perturbations from an alteration distribution to find optimal policies that are robust across a spectrum of conditions. This is akin to robust control concepts of handling uncertainties.  

A key contribution is a novel taxonomy to categorize adversarial attacks in DRL into:
- Observation alterations: Attacks that perturb the observation function, simulating sensor errors
- Dynamic alterations: Attacks perturbing the transition function by altering environment dynamics 

The taxonomy also classifies attacks by objective (deviate policy or minimize reward), knowledge requirement (white-box or black-box), and category of approach (direct optimization or adversarial policy learning).

The paper provides an in-depth analysis of contemporary attack methods using this taxonomy. It reviews techniques for both observation and dynamic alterations, covering gradient attacks, adversarial policies, etc. It highlights attack specifics like support and constraints.

Finally, the paper discusses strategies for adversarial training to improve robustness. This involves exposing agents to attacks during training so they learn to be resilient. Different training strategies are covered. The paper concludes by identifying open problems around explainability, attack feasibility and the need to balance robustness and efficiency.

In summary, this paper makes key contributions through its formalization of robustness in DRL, novel taxonomy of attacks, extensive literature review categorized under this taxonomy, and analysis of adversarial training techniques. It provides a foundational framework to guide future work on ensuring reliability of DRL agents.
