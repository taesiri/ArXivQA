# [Tight Group-Level DP Guarantees for DP-SGD with Sampling via Mixture of   Gaussians Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Computing tight group-level differential privacy (DP) guarantees for DP-SGD with sampling is challenging. Prior work uses an example-level guarantee converted via a generic composition theorem, but this can be loose and has numerical issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use privacy loss distribution (PLD) accounting with mixture of Gaussians (MoG) mechanisms. Show the output distributions of DP-SGD with sampling are dominated by an adaptive composition of scalar MoG mechanisms. 

- For Poisson sampling with probability $q$, show domination by MoG mechanisms with sensitivity drawn from $Binom(k,q)$. For fixed batch size $B$, show domination by MoG mechanisms with sensitivity $2$ times $Hypergeom(B, n+k, k)$.

Main Contributions:
- Give procedures to compute tight group-level DP guarantees for DP-SGD with Poisson or fixed batch size sampling, avoiding limitations of prior work.  

- Prove domination results that allow reducing analysis of DP-SGD with sampling to analysis of simpler MoG mechanisms. Show tightness of analysis for some loss functions.

- Empirically demonstrate improvements over prior work, including computing finite DP guarantees in regimes where prior work fails due to numerical issues. Highlight that group-level DP guarantees for DP-SGD grow close to linearly in group size $k$, unlike the exponential growth with $k$ from prior work.

In summary, the paper provides an improved analysis technique for an important DP learning algorithm, with both theoretical and empirical evidence showing the benefits of the proposed approach. The analysis applies broadly and could enable better accounting at scale.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper gives a procedure for computing tight group-level differential privacy guarantees for DP-SGD using Poisson or fixed batch size sampling by reducing it to analyzing compositions of mixture of Gaussians mechanisms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a procedure for computing tight group-level (ε, δ)-differential privacy guarantees for DP-SGD when using Poisson sampling or fixed batch size sampling. Specifically:

- The paper proves that the output distributions of compositions of scalar mixture of Gaussians (MoG) mechanisms with certain random sensitivities are dominating pairs for DP-SGD under group-level adjacencies (Theorems 1 and 2). This allows computing tight DP guarantees via privacy loss distribution accounting.

- The analysis is shown to be tight in general, i.e. for some instantiations of the loss function and datasets the DP guarantees match the actual privacy loss random variable. 

- Empirically, the analysis is shown to provide better DP guarantees compared to converting example-level guarantees using the theorem of Vadhan et al., especially for larger group sizes k. The guarantees also avoid numerical instability issues.

In summary, the main contribution is an improved analysis technique for obtaining tight group-level differential privacy guarantees for the important practical mechanism of DP-SGD with sampling.

The paper focuses on providing tight group-level differential privacy guarantees for DP-SGD when using Poisson sampling or fixed batch size sampling. It leverages privacy loss distribution accounting and introduces the use of mixture of Gaussians mechanisms to compute DP guarantees that are tight compared to prior approaches. Key properties analyzed include the tightness of the analysis for certain DP-SGD instances and the improved numerical stability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the mixture of Gaussians (MoG) mechanism allow for tighter group-level DP guarantees compared to using the composition theorem with example-level guarantees? What specifically about MoG mechanisms enables computing tighter guarantees?

2) The paper mentions a conjecture that for general non-convex losses, the privacy improvements from using a last-iterate analysis rather than an every-iterate analysis is marginal or zero. What are some research directions or assumptions one could make to try to disprove this conjecture?

3) What are some potential downsides or limitations of using the proposed MoG analysis instead of existing approaches? When might existing approaches still be preferred?

4) The empirical results show the MoG analysis gives epsilon values much closer to a linear lower bound. What explanations are there for why group-level epsilon for DP-SGD seems to still grow close to linearly? 

5) How much additional computational overhead is required to implement the proposed MoG analysis instead of using existing approaches? Is it feasible to incorporate in production ML systems?

6) Can the analysis be extended to account for other adjacent dataset definitions besides add/remove groups of size k? What about reasoning about continual observation attacks?

7) What improvements could be made to the MoG mechanism implementation to further close the gap between the achieved epsilons and the linear lower bound? 

8) How robust is the analysis to differences between the true batch sampling distribution and the binomial/hypergeometric distributions used in the proofs?

9) Could the use of MoG mechanisms and associated analysis techniques be applied to obtain tighter DP guarantees for other algorithms beyond DP-SGD?

10) What empirical evidence is there that the computed group-level privacy guarantees accurately reflect the privacy leakage, i.e. how do results on real datasets compare?
