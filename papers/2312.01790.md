# [Exploring Multi-Modal Fusion for Image Manipulation Detection and   Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01790)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores approaches for expanding image manipulation localization and detection (IMLD) architectures like TruFor to incorporate multiple forensic filters as inputs, hypothesizing that commonly used filters like SRM, Bayar convolution, and NoisePrint++ produce artifacts that are complementary in revealing different types of manipulations. The authors propose two fusion methods: late fusion, which extracts independent features from each filter before fusing them, and early fusion, which mixes the modal outputs early using convolutional blocks. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate state-of-the-art IMLD performance across several datasets for both approaches by effectively combining diverse forensic cues. Key findings include the complementarity of different filters, with NoisePrint++ excelling at manipulations covered by post-processing, and SRM/Bayar better at others; advantages of 6.3% over prior arts in copy-move localization using both fusion techniques; and more robustness than TruFor across image degradations. The novel exploration of integrating multiple forensic filter outputs to boost localization and detection opens up promising research directions.
