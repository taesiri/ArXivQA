# [LIBR+: Improving Intraoperative Liver Registration by Learning the   Residual of Biomechanics-Based Deformable Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Registering preoperative liver images to intraoperative physical liver anatomy is challenging due to deformations and only sparse intraoperative measurements available.  
- Existing methods have limitations - biomechanical model-based methods make simplifying assumptions about tissue mechanics resulting in inaccurate registrations; data-driven deep learning methods struggle due to limited ground truth deformations and variability in intraop data.

Proposed Solution - LIBR+:
- Hybrid registration approach combining biomechanical model LIBR and learning residual deformation using deep neural network
- LIBR provides initial physics-based linear elastic registration
- Residual network learns to improve on LIBR output to better match ground truth
- Formulated as Spline-Residual Graph Convolutional Neural Network (SR-GCN) 
- Has liver mesh branch to capture organ geometry 
- Has bipartite branch to incorporate sparse intraop measurements  
- Bipartite branch first trained using reconstruction loss in self-supervised manner
- Liver branch then trained to predict LIBR residual deformation, constrained by sparse points

Main Contributions:
- Novel hybrid registration approach combining biomechanics model and deep learning residual correction
- SR-GCN architecture to assimilate sparse variable intraop data and leverage liver geometry  
- Consistent improvement over model-based LIBR and data-driven V2S network baselines
- Increased robustness to unseen liver geometries and deformations compared to pure deep learning
- Helps overcome challenges of limited ground truth and inter-patient variability for registering liver images to physical space

In summary, the paper proposes a hybrid liver registration approach (LIBR+) that combines a biomechanical model (LIBR) with a residual learning spline-based graph convolutional network to improve accuracy and robustness of registering preoperative liver images to sparse intraoperative data.
