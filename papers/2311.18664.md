# [Multi-task learning with cross-task consistency for improved depth   estimation in colonoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18664)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes Col3D-MTL, a novel multi-task learning framework with cross-task consistency for improved monocular depth estimation in colonoscopy screening. The method uses a shared encoder (ResNet-50) and two separate decoders for depth estimation and surface normal prediction. It incorporates convolutional block attention modules (CBAM) for enhanced global context, as well as a custom depth-to-surface normal (D2SN) warping module to enforce consistency between the two tasks' outputs. Experiments are conducted on the C3VD colonoscopy dataset with pixel-level ground truth. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations demonstrate that Col3D-MTL outperforms state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods by a significant margin. The proposed cross-task consistency loss is shown to be highly effective in refining depth map predictions. Col3D-MTL achieves particularly compelling performance on unseen data from the descending colon, demonstrating the method's strong generalization ability. Limitations include depth inaccuracies in low lighting regions and inability to capture fine surface orientation details within small image patches. Future work involves enhancing robustness to translate the approach from synthetic to real-world clinical colonoscopy video.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-task learning approach with cross-task consistency between depth estimation and surface normal prediction to improve monocular depth estimation in colonoscopy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a multi-task learning network with one shared encoder and two independent decoders to predict depth and surface normal maps. This leads to enhanced feature representation of the scene. The surface normal decoder uses novel unit normal computation blocks (UNC blocks) to accurately recover the geometric orientation of the scene.

2. Incorporating a weighted cross-task consistency loss between the predicted surface normal and a warped surface normal computed from the predicted depth map using depth image gradients. This enforces consistency between the two geometrically related tasks. 

3. Setting a new benchmark on the C3VD colonoscopy dataset comprising state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods and validating the proposed multi-task learning with cross-task consistency framework. This is the first benchmark on this dataset with pixel-wise ground truth labels acquired from a silicone phantom model.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a multi-task learning approach with cross-task consistency to improve monocular depth estimation in colonoscopy, validated through benchmarking on a colonoscopy dataset with silicone phantom ground truth.
