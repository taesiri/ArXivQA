# [RAFIC: Retrieval-Augmented Few-shot Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Few-shot image classification aims to classify images into predefined categories using only a small number of labeled examples (e.g. 1-5) per class. This lack of sufficient training data makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy.

- Existing meta-learning approaches like MAML and ProtoNets also struggle with limited data availability during training.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a system called Retrieval-Augmented Few-shot Image Classification (RAFIC) that improves classification accuracy by first augmenting the small labeled dataset with additional retrieved images before model training. 

- RAFIC leverages CLIP image embeddings, an image database called LAION-5B (5 billion+ images), and a fast retrieval index called faiss to efficiently find the most relevant images to augment the dataset.

- The paper also proposes techniques to meta-learn the retrieval strategy, putting the right emphasis on the most useful retrieved images.

Key Contributions:

- Demonstrates that using CLIP image embeddings substantially improves accuracy compared to raw pixels (26% to 88%).

- Shows that retrieval augmentation consistently improves accuracy with more retrieved images across logistic regression, MAML and ProtoNets.

- Introduces techniques for meta-learning retrieval strategies with both coarse-grained control over the entire retrieved set and fine-grained control of individual images' importance.

- Reveals MAML's superior adaptability via cross-dataset evaluation compared to ProtoNets. 

- Provides an end-to-end system utilizing CLIP, LAION-5B and faiss that enables efficient and effective few-shot classification through retrieval augmentation and meta-learning.
