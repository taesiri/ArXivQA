# [From Pixel to Patch: Synthesize Context-aware Features for Zero-shot   Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12232)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to enable zero-shot semantic segmentation, i.e. segmenting objects from unseen classes with no pixel-level annotations. The key hypothesis is that contextual information can be used to generate diverse and context-aware visual features for unseen classes, which can then be used to train the segmentation model to recognize unseen objects.Specifically, the paper proposes a Context-aware feature Generation Network (CaGNet) that leverages contextual information to generate features for unseen classes. The main hypotheses are:1) Pixel-wise contextual information (gathered from surrounding pixels) can help generate more diverse features compared to using random noise vectors. This helps mitigate the mode collapse problem in feature generation.2) Generating patch-wise features and finetuning using these features can better capture inter-pixel relationships compared to only using pixel-wise features. This allows finetuning more convolutional layers in the segmentation network.3) Synthesizing small category patches (e.g. 3x3) that contain multiple categories using a modified PixelCNN can generate more realistic arrangements of categories compared to random patches. This leads to better patch-wise feature generation.By leveraging these ideas, the proposed CaGNet framework aims to effectively transfer knowledge from seen to unseen classes for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate improved performance over prior zero-shot segmentation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a novel Context-aware feature Generation Network (CaGNet) for zero-shot semantic segmentation. CaGNet synthesizes context-aware pixel-wise visual features for unseen categories based on category-level semantics and pixel-level contextual information. 2. Designing a contextual module to encode pixel-wise contextual information into contextual latent codes. A context selector is proposed to automatically select suitable context scales for each pixel.3. Extending pixel-wise feature generation and finetuning to patch-wise feature generation and finetuning. Patch-wise features consider inter-pixel relationships and allow finetuning more convolutional layers in the classifier.4. Modifying PixelCNN to generate semantically plausible category patches containing both seen and unseen categories. The generated patches guide patch-wise feature generation.5. Achieving significant improvements over previous zero-shot segmentation methods on Pascal VOC, COCO-stuff and Pascal-Context datasets. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CaGNet.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the CaGNet framework to synthesize context-aware visual features for zero-shot semantic segmentation. The integration of pixel/patch-wise feature generation, contextual modeling, and segmentation network makes CaGNet achieve new state-of-the-art results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel Context-aware Feature Generation Network (CaGNet) for zero-shot semantic segmentation, which can synthesize context-aware pixel-wise and patch-wise visual features for unseen categories based on category-level semantics and pixel-wise contextual information.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in zero-shot semantic segmentation:- The paper proposes a novel Context-aware feature Generation Network (CaGNet) to synthesize visual features for unseen categories using contextual information. This allows transferring knowledge from seen to unseen categories. - Most prior works in this field focused on mapping visual features to semantic word embeddings or vice versa. In contrast, this paper synthesizes visual features directly from word embeddings and contextual latent codes.- The paper extends the feature generation from pixel-level to patch-level. Patch-wise feature generation and finetuning better adapts the model to unseen categories by considering inter-pixel relationships. - The paper introduces two novel components - a context selector that chooses suitable context scale for each pixel, and a modified PixelCNN to generate plausible category patches.- Experiments show the proposed CaGNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art like SPNet, ZS3Net, CSRL on three benchmark datasets. The patch-wise version CaGNet(pa) further boosts the performance.- The paper provides thorough ablation studies and visualization to analyze the effect of different components. The contextual module and feature generation strategy are shown to be effective.Overall, this paper makes significant advances over prior arts by generating context-aware features, extending to patch-level generation, and designing new network components tailored for zero-shot segmentation. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Explore how to generate large feature patches while considering reasonable shapes or poses of unseen objects. The authors state that generating large category patches is very challenging, especially for unseen objects, due to the difficulty in imagining their shapes and poses. By generating larger feature patches, the performance of zero-shot semantic segmentation may be further improved.- Investigate more advanced generative models for category patch generation. The authors currently use PixelCNN for generating category patches, but suggest exploring other generative models that can better capture the spatial relationships and continuity between object categories.- Study how to effectively leverage unlabeled data. The paper focuses on an inductive zero-shot learning setting without using unlabeled test data during training. Using unlabeled data in a transductive or semi-supervised approach may help improve the generalization to unseen classes.- Apply the proposed approach to other dense prediction tasks like instance segmentation. The feature generation method may be adapted to enable zero-shot learning in other vision tasks.- Experiment on datasets with more categories and images. Evaluating the approach on larger and more complex datasets can better demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness.In summary, the main future direction is enhancing the feature generation module to produce higher quality features for unseen classes, by generating larger feature patches, using more advanced generative models, and leveraging unlabeled data. Applying the approach to other vision tasks is also suggested. Evaluating on larger datasets would also be valuable future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel Context-aware feature Generation Network (CaGNet) for zero-shot semantic segmentation. The key idea is to leverage pixel-wise contextual information to generate more diverse and context-aware visual features for unseen categories. A contextual module is designed to encode pixel-wise contextual information into contextual latent codes. A feature generator takes the contextual latent code and word embedding as input to reconstruct the visual feature for each pixel. The reconstructed features are used to finetune the classifier to enable segmenting unseen objects. Furthermore, the method is extended from pixel-wise feature generation to patch-wise feature generation, where a modified PixelCNN model is used to generate plausible category patches first. Then patch-wise features are synthesized conditioned on the category patches. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO-stuff and Pascal-Context datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CaGNet over previous state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic segmentation methods.
