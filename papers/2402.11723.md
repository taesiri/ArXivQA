# [Shaping Human-AI Collaboration: Varied Scaffolding Levels in Co-writing   with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11723)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI-assisted writing tools are rapidly advancing, enabling new forms of human-AI collaboration in creative writing tasks. However, there is limited understanding of how varying levels of AI scaffolding impact outcomes like writing quality, user experience, and sense of ownership. 

- Finding the right balance of human creativity and machine assistance is critical but complex. Overly minimal or excessive AI guidance could hamper writing outcomes and user satisfaction.

- This research gap needs to be addressed to create personalized, human-centric AI writing tools tailored to diverse user needs and aligned with AI-HCI considerations.

Solution:
- The authors conduct a within-subjects field experiment with 131 participants writing argumentative essays under 3 conditions: no AI help, next-sentence suggestions from AI (low scaffolding), and next-paragraph suggestions from AI (high scaffolding).

Key Findings:  
- Low scaffolding decreases writing quality, while high scaffolding increases it substantially - a "U-shaped" trend. High scaffolding also improves productivity.

- Non-regular writers and less tech-savvy users benefit more from high scaffolding. But all users see reduced satisfaction and text ownership with more AI help.

- Sequence effects exist - moving from sentence to paragraph suggestions boosts quality, implying learning, but removing scaffolding lowers it, indicating overreliance.

Contributions:
- Provides empirical evidence on the differential impact of varying AI scaffolding levels on writing outcomes and user experience.

- Offers guidance on balancing human-AI collaboration in writing tools to improve quality while maintaining user agency. 

- Advocates adaptive systems that adjust assistance based on user proficiency and modify support across writing stages.

- Contributes to research on personalized human-AI co-creation and intelligent writing assistants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the impact of varying levels of AI scaffolding from large language models on the quality of co-authored text and user experience, finding a U-shaped relationship whereby low scaffolding diminishes but high scaffolding enhances outcomes, especially for non-regular writers and less tech-savvy users, yet reduced user satisfaction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is an empirical analysis of how varying levels of AI scaffolding impact the collaborative writing process between humans and AI writing assistants. 

Specifically, the paper conducts a field experiment where participants complete writing tasks with no AI assistance, sentence-level AI suggestions, or paragraph-level AI suggestions. It evaluates the effects of these different scaffolding levels on outcomes like writing quality, user satisfaction, sense of ownership, productivity, etc.

The key findings reveal a U-shaped relationship, where low scaffolding (sentence suggestions) hurts writing quality but high scaffolding (paragraph suggestions) significantly improves it. However, high scaffolding also reduces user satisfaction and sense of ownership. There are also differences based on writing expertise and tech-savviness.

So in summary, the main contribution is an in-depth examination, through a controlled experiment, of how the degree of AI intervention in collaborative writing shapes various quantitative metrics around output quality, emotional investment, task efficiency, etc. as well as qualitative perceptions. This provides guidance on balancing human-AI collaboration in writing tools.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- AI scaffolding
- Co-writing 
- Generative AI
- Language models (LLMs)
- Human-AI collaboration
- Writing quality
- User experience
- Levels of support (no AI, sentence suggestions, paragraph suggestions)  
- Writing productivity  
- User satisfaction
- Sense of ownership
- Writing expertise (non-regular, regular, professional)
- Technology familiarity
- Positional effects
- Adaptive scaffolds
- Personalized scaffolds

The paper examines how different levels of AI scaffolding, specifically no assistance, next-sentence suggestions, and next-paragraph suggestions, impact outcomes like writing quality, productivity, user satisfaction and sense of ownership during a collaborative writing process between humans and AI. It analyzes these effects on users with varying writing expertise and technology familiarity. The paper also looks at how the sequence/position in which scaffolding conditions are presented influences writing quality. Concepts like personalized and adaptive scaffolds are discussed in terms of designing optimal human-AI writing systems. So these are some of the key terms and focus areas associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The study utilizes a within-subjects design with a Latin square arrangement to assign participants to different sequences of AI assistance conditions. What are the key advantages of using this experimental design? How does it strengthen the validity of the results compared to a between-subjects design?

2. The authors evaluate two levels of AI scaffolding - sentence-level and paragraph-level suggestions. What theories from educational psychology helped guide the choice of these scaffolding levels? How do they tie to ideas like Vygotsky's zone of proximal development?  

3. The interface allows users to request up to 5 AI suggestions by pressing the Tab key. What factors influenced the choice of allowing 5 suggestions? How might increasing or decreasing this number impact the user experience and study results?

4. The authors use automated tools like TAACO and TAALES to evaluate text quality. How do these tools work and what specific text attributes do they measure? What are the pros and cons of using automated versus human evaluations of writing quality?

5. What participant recruitment methods were used for the study? Why was an online crowdworking platform like MTurk not used? What implications does the participant selection process have for generalizability of the findings?

6. How exactly were the NASA Task Load index and other scale-based measures converted to numerical scores for analysis? What statistical models were used to estimate the impact of AI scaffolding on the various outcome variables?

7. The results indicate lower user satisfaction despite improved text quality with high scaffolding. What theories explain this unintuitive trend? How do ideas like effort justification shed light on it?  

8. What participant variables were found to moderate the impact of scaffolding on outcomes like text quality? What theories and past research help contextualize these differential effects? 

9. The study finds sequence effects whereby the transition from sentence to paragraph suggestions boosts quality. How does this align with cognitive and educational theories? What design implications does it highlight?

10. What are some key limitations of the study design and methodology? What future research directions are suggested to address these limitations and build generalizability?
