# [Shaping Human-AI Collaboration: Varied Scaffolding Levels in Co-writing   with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11723)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI-assisted writing tools are rapidly advancing, enabling new forms of human-AI collaboration in creative writing tasks. However, there is limited understanding of how varying levels of AI scaffolding impact outcomes like writing quality, user experience, and sense of ownership. 

- Finding the right balance of human creativity and machine assistance is critical but complex. Overly minimal or excessive AI guidance could hamper writing outcomes and user satisfaction.

- This research gap needs to be addressed to create personalized, human-centric AI writing tools tailored to diverse user needs and aligned with AI-HCI considerations.

Solution:
- The authors conduct a within-subjects field experiment with 131 participants writing argumentative essays under 3 conditions: no AI help, next-sentence suggestions from AI (low scaffolding), and next-paragraph suggestions from AI (high scaffolding).

Key Findings:  
- Low scaffolding decreases writing quality, while high scaffolding increases it substantially - a "U-shaped" trend. High scaffolding also improves productivity.

- Non-regular writers and less tech-savvy users benefit more from high scaffolding. But all users see reduced satisfaction and text ownership with more AI help.

- Sequence effects exist - moving from sentence to paragraph suggestions boosts quality, implying learning, but removing scaffolding lowers it, indicating overreliance.

Contributions:
- Provides empirical evidence on the differential impact of varying AI scaffolding levels on writing outcomes and user experience.

- Offers guidance on balancing human-AI collaboration in writing tools to improve quality while maintaining user agency. 

- Advocates adaptive systems that adjust assistance based on user proficiency and modify support across writing stages.

- Contributes to research on personalized human-AI co-creation and intelligent writing assistants.
