# [CoCon: A Self-Supervised Approach for Controlled Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03535)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question is how to control the content of text generated by large pretrained language models at a more fine-grained, word/phrase level. 

The authors motivate the need for more precise content control beyond just high-level attributes like topic and sentiment. They propose an approach called Content-Conditioner (CoCon) to incorporate target content into the generated text by conditioning on that content input. Their core hypothesis seems to be that CoCon can help guide a language model's output text to include specific words/phrases by taking that target content as input.

The main research questions around CoCon that the paper seems to address are:

- Can CoCon effectively incorporate target content words/phrases into generated text in a smooth, fluent way?

- Can CoCon control high-level attributes like topic and sentiment in a zero-shot manner by conditioning on words related to those attributes? 

- How does CoCon compare to other controlled text generation methods in terms of content similarity and attribute relevance?

- Can CoCon condition on multiple content inputs simultaneously to control different aspects of the generated text?

- How robust is CoCon's content control across varying strengths of the conditioning through the content bias term?

So in summary, the central research focus appears to be investigating how well CoCon can control the content of text at a finer granularity than prior work through conditioning the language model's generation process directly on target content inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing Content-Conditioner (CoCon) as an approach for more fine-grained control over text generation with pretrained language models. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the contribution seem to be:

- CoCon allows conditioning the text generation on desired content at a more fine-grained, word/phrase level rather than just high-level attributes like topic or sentiment. 

- The CoCon module is trained in a self-supervised manner on text samples from the pretrained LM itself, avoiding the need for labeled data.

- The training uses techniques like self reconstruction, cycle reconstruction, and adversarial losses to teach CoCon to incorporate desired content into fluent generated text.

- CoCon enables control over both content and high-level attributes like topic and sentiment in a complementary manner. It can also condition on multiple content inputs.

- CoCon's modular architecture means it can be flexibly combined with various pretrained LMs without extensive retraining or finetuning of the LM itself.

In summary, the core contribution appears to be proposing and demonstrating a method to achieve more fine-grained control over pretrained language model text generation through content conditioning, in a flexible and self-supervised manner.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of controlled text generation:

- The idea of controlling text generation from pretrained language models without finetuning is gaining more interest recently. This paper follows the approach of PPLM, which also modulates a pretrained model to control attributes like sentiment and topic. The CoCon model specifically focuses on finer-grained content control.

- Most other work on controlled text generation relies on training a model from scratch (like CTRL) or finetuning on an attribute-labeled dataset (some reinforcement learning methods). So the self-supervised approach of CoCon avoids expensive training or requirement for annotations.

- Using the pretrained LM's own texts as training data is an interesting self-supervised approach. The cycle reconstruction loss helps the model generalize to divergent text sources. This is different from other controlled generation methods that use supervised datasets.

- Evaluating content similarity directly through metrics like BLEU is fairly unique. Most other controlled generation papers focus more on attribute accuracy metrics. The automatic and human evaluations give a good sense of CoCon's content conditioning capabilities.

- The ability to condition on multiple content inputs is powerful and improves over single attribute control. This could open up more applications like multi-document summarization.

- Overall, the CoCon model seems to advance controlled generation by enabling direct content conditioning through a lightweight and self-supervised approach. The results look promising, but more analysis may be needed on how it generalizes to unseen texts.

In summary, this paper distinguishes itself from related work by its focus on fine-grained content control, self-supervised learning, and flexibility in conditioning. The results and analyses generally seem solid for an initial paper on this model. More rigorous testing on generalizability would help strengthen its contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other self-supervised objectives besides the proposed content masking and cycle reconstruction losses. The authors mention adversarial training as one possibility.

- Trying different model architectures and different ways of incorporating the content conditioning, beyond the proposed single Transformer block design.

- Evaluating CoCon's controllability and sample quality on other domains beyond news articles, such as stories, dialogue, technical writing, etc. 

- Comparing against other related conditional text generation methods. The authors compared with PPLM and CTRL but suggest trying more baselines.

- Evaluating how multiple content inputs interact. The authors showed CoCon can condition on multiple content inputs but do not deeply analyze their interactions.

- Varying the strength of content conditioning during inference in a more principled way, as the authors currently adjust it manually.

- Exploring whether CoCon's approach could work for multimodal generation by conditioning on image, audio or video inputs.

- Applying CoCon to conditional text style transfer instead of just generation.

- Testing CoCon's zero-shot control on other high-level attributes beyond sentiment and topic.

- Developing more automated metrics to evaluate the controllability of generated texts.

In summary, the authors propose future work on new training objectives, model architectures, applications to other domains and modalities, comparisons with more baselines, better understanding the conditioning mechanisms, and developing improved evaluation metrics for controllable text generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Content-Conditioner (CoCon), a self-supervised approach to control the content of text generated by pretrained Transformer-based language models at a fine-grained level. CoCon incorporates a content conditioning block between the encoder and decoder sections of a pretrained language model. This block attends to encoded representations of input content text and transforms the decoder's hidden states to assimilate the content. CoCon is trained via a self-supervised objective where it learns to help the language model reconstruct partially observed text sequences when given the missing parts as content input. Experiments demonstrate CoCon's ability to naturally incorporate target content into generated text while controlling high-level attributes like topic and sentiment in a zero-shot manner. The self-supervised training absolves labeled data and its modular architecture enables complementary use with existing controlled generation methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called Content-Conditioner (CoCon) for controlled text generation using pretrained language models. CoCon incorporates a lightweight conditioning block that enables incorporating specific content into the generated text at a finer, more localized level compared to prior work like PPLM and CTRL which control attributes like sentiment or topic. 

The key idea is to split the pretrained language model into an encoder and decoder, and insert the CoCon block in between. During training, CoCon learns to help the decoder complete partial text sequences by conditioning on future tokens that are initially hidden from the decoder. This is achieved through a self-supervised objective requiring no manual labeling. Experiments demonstrate CoCon's ability to naturally assimilate target content into generated text while controlling attributes like topic and sentiment in a zero-shot manner. The modular CoCon approach is complementary to existing controlled generation methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Content-Conditioner (CoCon) approach for controlled text generation with pretrained language models like GPT-2. The CoCon module consists of an additional Transformer block that is interleaved with the pretrained LM to incorporate content conditioning. CoCon is trained with a self-supervised learning approach on text samples from the LM itself by reconstructing partially masked sequences when conditioned on the masked content. Specifically, sequences are split into two segments and the latter segment is provided as the content input to help CoCon reconstruct the full sequence through a self-reconstruction loss. Additional cycle reconstruction and adversarial losses are used during training to improve CoCon's ability to smoothly integrate divergent content sources into fluent text. A key advantage of this approach is that the pretrained LM can be used without any fine-tuning or architectural changes, while the small CoCon module brings controlled generation capabilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence TL;DR summary:

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to control the content of text generated by large pretrained language models at a more fine-grained, word- and phrase-level. 

The paper discusses how recent work has shown success in controlling attributes like sentiment and topic of generated text, but that there is still a lack of precise control over the actual content. Even texts generated to match the same high-level attributes can have widely varying content.

So the key question or problem is how to gain more fine-grained control over the words and phrases that appear in generated text, beyond just aligning with high-level attributes. The authors propose an approach called Content-Conditioner (CoCon) to address this problem by conditioning the language model on an additional content input.

In summary, the main problem is how to control the fine-grained content of text generated by large language models, beyond alignment with attributes like sentiment or topic. The authors propose CoCon as an approach to provide this level of word- and phrase-level content control.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on skimming through the paper, some of the key terms and concepts that seem most relevant are:

- Content-Conditioner (CoCon): The proposed approach to control text generation of language models using a content input.

- Self-supervised learning: The method used to train the CoCon block, where it learns to help the language model reconstruct partially observed text sequences.

- Content input: The text sequence that provides the content to condition the language model's text generation on. 

- Content masking: A technique used during CoCon's self-supervised training to mask future content tokens that need to be predicted.

- Cycle reconstruction loss: A training loss function that encourages generalization between divergent content input and prompt text sources.  

- Null content loss: A loss term to encourage fluent text generation without relying on the content input.

- Adversarial loss: A loss function using adversarial training to match CoCon-generated text representations with original text.

- Content bias: Allows adjusting the strength of content conditioning during inference by biasing the attention weights.

- Nucleus sampling: The decoding method used during generation from the conditioned language model.

So in summary, the key ideas seem to revolve around using self-supervised training of a content conditioning block, the CoCon model itself, the various training techniques like cycle loss and content masking, and methods to control the generations like content bias.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes Content-Conditioner (CoCon), a self-supervised approach for controlling text generation from pretrained language models like GPT-2 at a fine-grained word- and phrase-level. CoCon comprises a pretrained language model and an interleave CoCon layer. The CoCon layer helps complete a partially observed text sequence by conditioning it on a content input text that is withheld from the language model. CoCon is trained via a self-supervised learning method, where the training data consists of text samples generated by the pretrained language model itself. The text samples are split into two contiguous segments and CoCon learns to help the language model reconstruct the latter segments when given the former segments as context. This is achieved through several loss functions including self-reconstruction, null content, and cycle reconstruction losses. Experiments demonstrate CoCon's ability to naturally incorporate target content into generated text while controlling high-level attributes like topic and sentiment in a zero-shot manner. Ablation studies and comparisons to strong baselines like CTRL and PPLM highlight CoCon's fine-grained control over generated text through content inputs. The self-supervised approach also reduces training costs compared to methods that require labeled data or finetuning the language model.
