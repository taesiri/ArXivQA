# [PET-SQL: A Prompt-enhanced Two-stage Text-to-SQL Framework with   Cross-consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) methods that stimulate large language models (LLMs) via prompt engineering have achieved significant improvements. However, these approaches face challenges when dealing with verbose database schema information and complex user questions. 

Proposed Solution - PET-SQL Framework:
This paper presents a prompt-enhanced two-stage text-to-SQL framework called PET-SQL to improve LLM-based text-to-SQL systems. The key components are:

1. Elaborated Prompt (Reference-Enhanced Representation): Besides schema info, it includes sampled cell values from tables as references and optimization instructions for the LLM.

2. Two-Stage SQL Generation: 
- Stage 1: Retrieve similar QA pairs, prompt LLM to generate preliminary SQL (PreSQL) 
- Stage 2: Simplify prompt using schema linking from PreSQL, prompt again to output final SQL

3. Cross-Consistency Checking: Instead of self-consistency in one LLM, consistency of SQL execution results is checked across multiple diverse LLMs.

Main Contributions:

- Design of an elaborated prompt with cell value references and optimization rules to better guide the LLM

- Introduction of a PreSQL-based schema linking approach to simplify verbose information in prompts 

- Proposal of cross-consistency checking using multiple LLMs instead of self-consistency in one LLM

The PET-SQL framework achieves state-of-the-art 87.6% on the Spider benchmark, outperforming prior arts. The elaborated prompting and cross-consistency modules are shown to be highly effective.
