# [PET-SQL: A Prompt-enhanced Two-stage Text-to-SQL Framework with   Cross-consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) methods that stimulate large language models (LLMs) via prompt engineering have achieved significant improvements. However, these approaches face challenges when dealing with verbose database schema information and complex user questions. 

Proposed Solution - PET-SQL Framework:
This paper presents a prompt-enhanced two-stage text-to-SQL framework called PET-SQL to improve LLM-based text-to-SQL systems. The key components are:

1. Elaborated Prompt (Reference-Enhanced Representation): Besides schema info, it includes sampled cell values from tables as references and optimization instructions for the LLM.

2. Two-Stage SQL Generation: 
- Stage 1: Retrieve similar QA pairs, prompt LLM to generate preliminary SQL (PreSQL) 
- Stage 2: Simplify prompt using schema linking from PreSQL, prompt again to output final SQL

3. Cross-Consistency Checking: Instead of self-consistency in one LLM, consistency of SQL execution results is checked across multiple diverse LLMs.

Main Contributions:

- Design of an elaborated prompt with cell value references and optimization rules to better guide the LLM

- Introduction of a PreSQL-based schema linking approach to simplify verbose information in prompts 

- Proposal of cross-consistency checking using multiple LLMs instead of self-consistency in one LLM

The PET-SQL framework achieves state-of-the-art 87.6% on the Spider benchmark, outperforming prior arts. The elaborated prompting and cross-consistency modules are shown to be highly effective.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a two-stage text-to-SQL framework called PET-SQL that enhances prompt representations with database samples and instructions, simplifies schemas via preliminary SQL generation, and applies cross-model consistency for improved performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of the PET-SQL framework are:

1. An elaborated prompt design with customized instructions, database information, and table sample values to better instruct large language models (LLMs) for generating SQL queries. 

2. A two-stage SQL generation process, where the first stage generates a preliminary SQL (PreSQL) using question similarity-based few-shot learning, and the second stage simplifies the prompt schema using entities parsed from the PreSQL to generate the final SQL.

3. A cross-consistency module that utilizes the diversity across different LLMs rather than self-consistency within one LLM for improving the final predicted SQL.

So in summary, the main contributions are the prompt design, two-stage SQL generation process, and cross-consistency module to enhance LLM performance on the Text2SQL task. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Spider benchmark.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL): The task of converting natural language questions into SQL queries. This is the main focus application area of the paper.

- Large language models (LLMs): The use of large pre-trained language models is a key component of the proposed approach. Examples mentioned include GPT-4, CodeLlama, etc.

- Prompt engineering: Elaborating effective prompt representations to better instruct the LLMs, including reference-enhanced prompt, optimization rules, etc.

- Two-stage framework: The proposed PET-SQL has two stages - generating a preliminary SQL in the first stage, then simplifying and generating the final SQL in the second stage.

- Schema linking: Identifying relevant table/column names from the preliminary SQL to simplify the prompt by removing irrelevant information. 

- Cross-consistency: Ensuring consistency across SQLs generated by different LLMs, rather than self-consistency within one LLM.

- Execution accuracy: The key evaluation metric used to measure the accuracy of generated SQL queries, by executing them and comparing results.

In summary, the key focus is on optimizing prompts for LLMs and applying cross-model consistency to improve text-to-SQL translation accuracy.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a reference-enhanced prompt representation. What is the rationale behind including sample cell values from tables in the prompt? How does this help the language model generate better SQL queries?

2. The paper uses a question skeleton-based strategy to retrieve similar question-SQL demonstrations from the training set. Why is masking domain-specific entities useful for assessing question similarity based on intent? 

3. The preliminary SQL (PreSQL) is used as the basis for schema linking rather than prompting the language model to directly output relevant table/column names. What are the potential advantages of this PreSQL-based schema linking approach?

4. How exactly is the schema linking conducted based on the PreSQL? What linking assumptions are made and why are they reasonable?

5. After schema linking, the prompt is simplified by removing irrelevant information based on the linked schema. Why is prompting the language model again with this simplified schema likely to improve performance?

6. The paper proposes cross-consistency instead of self-consistency for post-refinement. Why is voting across diverse language models better than repeated sampling from the same model? What issues does self-consistency have?

7. What language models were used for cross-consistency voting in the experiments? Why was fine-grained voting based on question complexity better than naive voting?

8. The optimization rule in the prompt aims to make the language model consider both correctness and efficiency. How might this impact the SQL generation process and resulting queries? 

9. Could the reference-enhanced prompt design be adapted to other language tasks beyond text-to-SQL? What components seem most transferable?

10. The two-stage design generates a preliminary SQL before the final output. What are the tradeoffs of stopping at the preliminary vs final SQL? When would each be preferred?
