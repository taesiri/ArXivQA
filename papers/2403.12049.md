# [Toward Improving Robustness of Object Detectors Against Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12049)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Object detection models like YOLOv4 suffer performance drops when tested on out-of-domain data (domain shift problem). For example, a model trained on clear weather driving scenes performs poorly on foggy/hazy scenes. This hinders the deployment of such models in real-world autonomous driving applications.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a data augmentation method to improve model robustness against domain shift. The key ideas are:

1) Generate synthetic hazy images from clear images using a depth estimation model (Monodepth2) and haze imaging model (Koschmiederâ€™s law). This diversifies the training data.

2) Train YOLOv4 on a combination of original (clear) images and synthetic hazy images. Term this model as YOLOv4-Synt.

Main Contributions:

1) A data synthesis pipeline using Monodepth2 and Koschmieder's law to generate diverse, realistic synthetic hazy images from clear images.

2) Demonstrating improved performance of YOLOv4-Synt over vanilla YOLOv4 on both synthetic hazy test set (Waymo-Haze: +5.7% mAP) as well as real foggy driving datasets (+5.3% mAP). This validates the efficacy of the proposed data augmentation strategy.

3) The proposed synthesis module can work in offline (prior to training) or online (during training) mode with similar performance. This makes the method convenient to adopt.

In summary, the paper presents a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy to improve robustness of object detectors against domain shift to foggy/hazy conditions. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate clear improvements over the base YOLOv4 model.
