# [Dólares or Dollars? Unraveling the Bilingual Prowess of Financial LLMs   Between Spanish and English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07405)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a significant gap in Spanish language capabilities of financial natural language processing (NLP) models and applications compared to English. This is an issue as Spanish has an important global role in finance.
- Current financial language models like FinBERT and financial large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT are predominantly English-centric. Very limited work has been done on developing Spanish financial LLMs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces "Toisón de Oro", the first bilingual framework for financial LLMs encompassing Spanish and English. It has 3 main components:
  1) FIT-ES: A meticulously curated multi-task instruction tuning dataset with over 144k Spanish and English samples covering 7 financial tasks.
  2) FinMA-ES: A 7 billion parameter financial LLM fine-tuned using FIT-ES to enhance Spanish and English capabilities.
  3) FLARE-ES: A comprehensive bilingual benchmark with 21 datasets covering 9 financial tasks to evaluate capabilities of LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- First bilingual framework specifically designed for financial NLP in Spanish and English consisting of instruction data, LLM and benchmark.
- FIT-ES: First multi-task bilingual instruction tuning dataset for financial LLM pre-training.
- FinMA-ES: First bilingual financial LLM optimized to process both Spanish and English financial texts.  
- FLARE-ES benchmark reveals significant performance gaps and biases of leading LLMs like GPT-4 in Spanish.
- Evaluation shows FinMA-ES models outperform GPT-4 in Spanish financial tasks due to impact of instruction tuning and cross-linguistic transfer.
- Released all framework components to promote innovation in financial NLP sector and multilingual capabilities.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in addressing the gap in Spanish capabilities for financial NLP by proposing the first comprehensive bilingual framework encompassing models, data and evaluation benchmarks to significantly enhance Spanish and English financial language understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Toisón de Oro, the first bilingual framework for financial NLP encompassing Spanish-English datasets, models, and benchmarks which exposes significant performance gaps in existing models while demonstrating superior results for the proposed FinMA-ES model in Spanish tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It created the first bilingual framework specifically designed for Spanish-English financial NLP and prediction tasks. 

2. It developed the first bilingual and multi-task instruction tuning dataset (FIT-ES) with over 144K samples from 15 datasets covering 7 tasks.

3. It developed and fine-tuned the FinMA-ES model, the first LLM optimized for processing and understanding bilingual financial data in both Spanish and English.

4. It established the FLARE-ES benchmark, the first comprehensive set of evaluations allowing for the cross-lingual assessment of models on both Spanish and English financial tasks.

5. Its evaluation using the FLARE-ES benchmark showed that the FinMA-ES models notably outperform leading LLMs like GPT-4 in Spanish financial tasks, revealing significant multilingual performance disparities and the unexpected benefits of cross-linguistic transfer from instruction tuning and diverse linguistic data.

In summary, this paper made several key contributions in developing bilingual capabilities for financial NLP, including bilingual datasets, models, and evaluation benchmarks, with results showing improved performance and revealing insights into multilingual challenges.

The paper introduces a bilingual framework for Spanish and English financial language models, including a bilingual dataset for instruction tuning, a bilingual financial language model called FinMA-ES, and a comprehensive bilingual evaluation benchmark. It addresses the gap in Spanish and bilingual financial NLP capabilities compared to English models. Concepts like instruction tuning, leveraging both high and low resource languages, cross-lingual transfer effects, multitask learning across financial tasks, evaluation benchmarks for testing generalization, and analyzing performance disparities across languages seem central to this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes the FIT-ES dataset for instruction tuning. What were the key considerations and steps involved in curating this diverse bilingual dataset? How was the quality and accuracy of the annotations ensured?

2. The FinMA-ES model leverages transfer learning from the LLaMA2 backbone. What adaptations were made to the architecture or objectives of LLaMA2 to enable effective fine-tuning on financial tasks? 

3. The instruction templates designed for the FIT-ES dataset seem to play a pivotal role. What guidelines or principles were followed to ensure these prompts elicit robust and relevant responses from the LLMs?

4. When fine-tuning FinMA-ES, a learning rate of 3e-4 is used along with the AdamW optimizer. What motivated the selection of these specific hyperparameters? Were any ablation studies done to validate this choice?  

5. The paper highlights the superior performance of the bilingual FinMA-ES model compared to the Spanish-only version. What mechanisms enable the cross-lingual transfer of knowledge in this model?

6. Six additional English datasets are included in the FLARE-ES benchmark to assess generalization ability. What strategies were used to select these specific datasets and how do they complement the existing test sets?

7. The results reveal FinMA-ES surpasses GPT-4 on various Spanish tasks. What architectural or methodological limitations in GPT-4 might account for this underperformance? 

8. When analyzing the results, several interesting insights are highlighted regarding cross-lingual transfer effects. What future work could further investigate these observations?

9. Considering the computational constraints outlined, what model scaling strategies can be explored in future work to enhance FinMA-ES's parameters and training?

10. What steps were taken during the development of FinMA-ES and the overall framework to proactively address ethical concerns around potential financial application misuse?
