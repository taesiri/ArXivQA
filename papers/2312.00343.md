# [OpenStereo: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Stereo Matching and Strong   Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00343)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces OpenStereo, a comprehensive and extensible PyTorch-based codebase for stereo matching research. OpenStereo supports various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets and provides a standardized framework for training, evaluation, and comparison. Leveraging OpenStereo, the authors conduct an in-depth revisitation of stereo matching methods through extensive ablation studies examining data augmentation, feature extraction, cost volume construction, and disparity regression strategies. These investigations reveal important insights and motivate the proposal of StereoBase, a simple yet powerful baseline model setting a new state-of-the-art on the SceneFlow dataset. Specifically, StereoBase utilizes optimized data augmentation, a MobileNetV2 backbone, combined cost volume, context upsampling disparity regression, and refinement to achieve an unprecedented end-point-error of 0.43. Through its unified implementation platform and strong reference model, OpenStereo aims to push forward innovation in stereo matching research. The codebase and StereoBase establish a reliable benchmark for assessing new methods and understanding component contributions.
