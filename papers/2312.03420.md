# [Artist-Friendly Relightable and Animatable Neural Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03420)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for creating animatable and relightable neural avatars of human heads. The method builds on the Mixture of Volumetric Primitives (MVP) architecture, which represents a deformable head model using a collection of geometric primitives with appearance properties. The key contribution is an illumination-modulated appearance branch that conditions the primitive appearance not just on view direction but also on per-primitive local light directions. This allows relighting with near-field effects. The model is trained on multi-view video of an actor performing facial expressions, captured under one-light-at-a-time illumination from an inexpensive LED setup. Compared to prior work like TRAvatar, this method achieves higher quality rendering of faces under novel lighting conditions and viewpoints, even generalizing to new expressions. Key results demonstrate photorealistic rendering of captured or artist-created performances with control over scene illumination using environment maps. Limitations include motion blur and inability to extrapolate beyond the span of training expressions. The proposed relightable MVP representation leads to an animatable neural head model with unprecedented artistic control.
