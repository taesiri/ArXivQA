# [Learning Free Terminal Time Optimal Closed-loop Control of Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17749)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach for learning optimal closed-loop controllers for robotic manipulators that can dynamically adjust both task duration and control inputs to enhance performance. The method extends prior work on using optimal open-loop solutions from numerical solvers as supervised training data for policy networks to the free terminal time setting. It addresses several key challenges in this extension. First, it introduces a marching scheme in the open-loop solver that progressively refines time discretization to improve solution quality and increase convergence rates. Second, it adapts the QRnet architecture to handle discontinuities and stability issues with the control policy around terminal states. Third, it develops an automated, adaptive version of the initial value problem (IVP) enhanced sampling method that systematically updates the training dataset by identifying states along simulated trajectories where the learned policy deviates significantly from the optimal one. By integrating these techniques, the resulting controller can effectively handle tasks with varying optimal durations across a broad domain, achieving near globally optimal cost. Demonstrated for a 7-DoF manipulator, the method could be applied to optimize productivity in real-world robotic manipulation applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel approach to learning free terminal time optimal closed-loop control for robotic manipulators using neural networks, which enables simultaneous optimization of task duration and control inputs by addressing key challenges like efficiently generating high-quality training data, handling discontinuities, and iterative sampling enhancement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It extends the supervised learning approach to learn a free terminal time optimal controller for robotic manipulators. This allows the running time and control inputs to be optimized simultaneously to enhance performance. 

2) It addresses three main challenges in extending supervised learning to the free terminal time setting:

a) It introduces a marching scheme in the open-loop solver that progressively refines the time discretization to improve solution quality and increase convergence rate. 

b) It adapts the QRnet architecture to handle the discontinuity at the terminal state in free terminal time optimal control problems. This significantly improves stability.

c) It presents a more automated version of the initial value problem (IVP) enhanced sampling method that adaptively selects resampling times. This leads to better quality training data.

3) By integrating these techniques, the paper develops a closed-loop policy that can operate effectively over a wide domain where the optimal time durations vary substantially, achieving near globally optimal total costs.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing supervised learning of optimal control to the more challenging setting of free terminal time through targeted algorithmic improvements in data generation, neural network training, and adaptive sampling.
