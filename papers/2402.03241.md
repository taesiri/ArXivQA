# [FROSTER: Frozen CLIP Is A Strong Teacher for Open-Vocabulary Action   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03241)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the problem of open-vocabulary action recognition, where the goal is to recognize actions from categories not seen during training. Prior methods that fine-tune CLIP for video suffer from overfitting, losing generalization ability on unseen categories. 

Key Ideas
The paper proposes FROSTER, a framework to make CLIP video-specific while retaining its generalization. It has two key ideas:

1. Residual feature distillation: Uses frozen CLIP as a teacher to regularize a fine-tuned "student" network. This ensures the student does not deviate too much from the original CLIP, maintaining generalization. A residual adapter design balances video-specific learning and staying close to CLIP features.

2. Augmenting class names with descriptions during training, generating more helpful text supervision.

Together, these improve recognition on both seen and unseen categories.

Experiments 
FROSTER is evaluated on multiple datasets under base-to-novel (recognizing unseen classes) and cross-dataset (generalization to new datasets) settings. It consistently achieves state-of-the-art, demonstrating its video adaptation while retaining CLIP's generalization strength. Analyses reveal it attends to more informative regions than CLIP or tuned baselines. Improvements are higher on datasets requiring more generalization.

Contributions:
- Residual feature distillation to balance video-specific adaptation and generalization
- Demonstrating superior open-vocabulary recognition ability under base-to-novel and cross-dataset evaluations
- Broad compatibility with different network architectures

In summary, FROSTER effectively tunes CLIP for video while overcoming common overfitting issues, through its proposed distillation approach and text augmentation. Experiments thoroughly demonstrate its state-of-the-art open-vocabulary recognition, showcasing its reliability and versatility.
