# [Prompt2NeRF-PIL: Fast NeRF Generation via Pretrained Implicit Latent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02568)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This experimental paper explores prompt-driven generation of 3D Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models from text or image inputs. It proposes Prompt2NeRF-PIL, a framework to directly generate NeRF scene parameters conditioned on prompts in a single forward pass, without needing per-prompt optimization. This is achieved by pretraining an autoencoder to map NeRF parameters to an interpolatable latent space, and using a Transformer to align text/image embeddings to this latent space. At test time, prompts are mapped to the latent space and decoded to NeRF parameters. For in-distribution scenes, this directly generates high-quality NeRFs. For out-of-distribution scenes, the generated NeRF serves as an initialization to significantly accelerate optimization in prior prompt-driven NeRF methods like DreamFusion and Zero-1-to-3. Experiments demonstrate 3-5x faster convergence with the Prompt2NeRF-PIL initialization, along with improved quality and consistency. The work shows the promise of prompt-conditioned implicit generation of 3D scene representations.
