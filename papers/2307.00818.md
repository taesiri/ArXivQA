# Motion-X: A Large-scale 3D Expressive Whole-body Human Motion Dataset

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How to collect large-scale 3D whole-body human motion data with corresponding text descriptions to enhance expressive and diverse human motion generation?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Existing human motion datasets are limited in scale, diversity, and expressiveness (e.g. lacking facial expressions, hand gestures, diverse scenes). This data scarcity issue hinders the development of expressive and realistic human motion generation models. 2) By developing a scalable pipeline to annotate whole-body motion and text from massive video sources, it is possible to construct a large-scale expressive motion dataset to benefit motion generation and related tasks.To test these hypotheses, the authors propose an automatic pipeline to extract 3D whole-body motion parameters and generate textual pose descriptions from videos. Using this pipeline, they build a new dataset called Motion-X with 13.7M frames of annotated motions and texts. Experiments show Motion-X helps improve state-of-the-art motion generation models in diversity and expressiveness. The accuracy of the annotation pipeline and the dataset's benefits are validated on tasks like motion generation and 3D human mesh recovery.In summary, the central research question is about how to collect diverse, expressive motion data at scale to advance motion generation. The key hypothesis is that an automatic annotation pipeline can achieve this goal. Motion-X dataset is constructed to test this hypothesis.
