# [SynCDR : Training Cross Domain Retrieval Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00420)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of cross-domain image retrieval, where given a query image from one domain (e.g. a sketch), the goal is to retrieve similar images from another domain (e.g. product images in an online catalog). Prior methods for this problem rely on the presence of same-category image pairs across domains in the training data so that similarity can be learned. However, in some cases such pairs may be missing, causing these methods to fail. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes to address this issue by generating synthetic data via label-preserving image translation to fill in missing categories across domains. Specifically, given an image in domain A, they translate it to domain B while preserving its semantic content. This results in a synthetic image pair with the same category label, which is used as additional supervision. They term this pseudo-positive pair (PPP) loss. The overall model, SynCDR, is trained with a combination of this PPP loss and a prior contrastive loss for cross-domain retrieval.

Four different generative models are explored for the image translation:
(1) Contrastive unpaired translation (CUT)
(2) Img2Img 
(3) InstructPix2Pix
(4) ELITE
Of these, ELITE, which leverages CLIP image encoders and Stable Diffusion, is found to generate the best quality synthetic data.

Main Contributions:

- Identify limitations of prior cross-domain retrieval methods when same-category image pairs are unavailable across domains
- Propose label-preserving image translation to generate synthetic data for missing categories
- Introduce PPP loss that utilizes category label equivalence of translated image pairs 
- Demonstrate improved cross-domain retrieval through SynCDR trained with synthetic data, especially using ELITE for translation. Gain of ~15% on DomainNet and ~6% on CUB birds dataset.

In summary, the paper presents an effective approach to generate synthetic data pairs for cross-domain retrieval when labels across domains are disjoint or unavailable. Leveraging recent advances in conditional image generation, the proposed SynCDR model outperforms prior state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using synthetic data generated by label-preserving image translation to train cross-domain retrieval models when same-category image pairs across domains are unavailable in the training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to train cross-domain image retrieval models using synthetic data (SynCDR) to fill in missing category examples across domains. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that prior self-supervised cross-domain retrieval methods like CDS rely on having some overlap of categories across domains, and perform poorly when such overlap is missing. 

2) To address this, the paper generates synthetic examples via label-preserving image translation to make up for missing categories. This allows using additional supervisory signal in the form of pseudo-positive pairs (real image and its synthetic counterpart are positives).

3) The paper compares various translation methods to generate synthetic data, including those requiring domain-specific training as well as large scale pre-trained models usable with prompts. The best results are obtained using the personalization method ELITE with Stable Diffusion.

4) Experiments on DomainNet and CUB datasets show improvements of 15% and 6% respectively over baselines without using synthetic data, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed SynCDR approach.

In summary, the core contribution is a synthetic data generation and training strategy to effectively train cross-domain retrieval models even with completely disjoint categories across domains.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Cross-domain retrieval - Retrieving images from one visual domain that match a query image from a different visual domain.

- Synthetic data - Artificially generated images used to augment training data. 

- Label-preserving translation - Generating synthetic images that preserve the semantic content/category of the original image while changing the visual style to match the target domain. 

- Pseudo-positive pairs (PPP) - Treating an original image and its label-preserving synthetic counterpart as a positive training pair.

- Contrastive loss - A loss function that pulls positive pairs close together and pushes negative pairs apart in an embedding space. Used for self-supervised representation learning.

- Unpaired image translation - Generating corresponding images across domains without needing aligned image pairs, using methods like cycleGAN. 

- Text-to-image diffusion models - Generative models that can generate highly realistic images from text prompts, like Stable Diffusion.

- Personalization - Techniques to adapt text-to-image models to generate customized images of new visual concepts specified by few example images.

So in summary, key terms cover cross-domain retrieval, using synthetic data, label-preserving translation techniques, contrastive self-supervised learning, and leveraging large generative models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that prior self-supervised cross-domain retrieval methods rely on the presence of same category data across domains for training. Can you elaborate on why this is the case and how the method fails when such data is unavailable?

2. The core idea of the paper is to use synthetic data to fill the gaps of missing categories across domains. Can you walk through the full process of how this synthetic data is generated using label-preserving image translation? 

3. The paper explores both domain-specific translation methods like CUT as well as large-scale pretrained models like Stable Diffusion for synthetic data generation. What are the key tradeoffs between these two approaches? When might one be preferred over the other?

4. Explain the Pseudo Positive Pairs (PPP) loss proposed in the paper and how it utilizes the label-preservation of synthetic translations. Why is this an important addition over just using cross-domain self-supervision with synthetic data?

5. The paper finds ELITE to generate the best synthetic data overall. Walk through how ELITE works at a high level. Why does encoding image content into Stable Diffusion's vocabulary lead to better quality translations? 

6. Besides accuracy, what other metrics are used to evaluate the quality of synthetic data from different generation methods? How well do these relate to final retrieval performance?

7. The paper uses Textual Inversion as an analysis experiment. Explain how it works and discuss its limitations that the paper identifies in representing target domain properties.

8. What conclusions can you draw about the efficacy of distillation from large CLIP models versus using synthetic data for training cross-domain retrieval? When might distillation be preferred?

9. The paper identifies domains that cannot be easily textually described as a limitation. Propose an approach to generate synthetic data for such domains using ideas from the paper.

10. Besides image retrieval, what are some other potential applications where the idea of using synthetic data to fill missing categories can be useful?
