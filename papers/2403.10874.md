# [Robotic Task Success Evaluation Under Multi-modal Non-Parametric Object   Pose Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate 6D object pose estimation is critical for various robotic manipulation tasks like grasping. However, uncertainty in the estimated pose can lead to failures in executing such tasks. At the same time, a certain degree of error may be acceptable depending on the requirements of the task. Hence, the key problems are 1) quantifying the error in the estimated pose, and 2) determining whether this error is acceptable for successful task execution. Both the pose uncertainty and acceptable error often have complex non-Gaussian distributions that are challenging to model.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents a framework to evaluate the likelihood of task success given the uncertainty in the estimated object pose. It represents both the estimated error space of the object pose and the acceptable error space for the task using multi-modal non-parametric distributions. The framework has two main steps:

1. Offline simulation to pre-compute the acceptable error space for the task by introducing various errors in the object pose and checking via simulation whether the task can still succeed.  

2. Online calculation of task success probability by integrating the pre-computed acceptable error space over the estimated error space of the current object pose distribution.

Main Contributions:

- Represents both estimated pose uncertainty and acceptable task error using multi-modal distributions instead of typical Gaussian assumptions.

- Pre-computes the complex acceptable error space through offline simulation for efficiency.  

- Integrates these spaces online to predict task success probability.

- Demonstrates the framework on mobile manipulation tasks - navigating to base pose for grasping and grasp success itself.

- Achieves 91% grasp success rate with only 6% failures across objects, significantly outperforming baselines that use greedy execution, visual confidence or Gaussian uncertainty assumptions.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to model complex pose uncertainties and task constraints for reliable decision making regarding execution, with very promising results on real mobile manipulation tasks.
