# [Closing the Gap Between SGP4 and High-Precision Propagation via   Differentiable Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04830)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- SGP4 is a widely used orbital propagator that supports two-line elements (TLEs) data. However, it has lower accuracy compared to numerical propagators. 
- There is no existing open-source differentiable version of SGP4 that allows gradient computations via automatic differentiation. This limits applications in gradient-based optimization, orbit determination, etc.
- Current approaches to improve SGP4 accuracy using machine learning only correct the outputs, not the inputs/internal parameters. This limits further accuracy improvements.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces dSGP4 - an open-source differentiable version of SGP4 implemented in PyTorch. This allows automatic differentiation of inputs/outputs.
- It enables precise gradient computations for tasks like optimization, orbit determination, covariance propagation, etc. without finite differencing errors.
- A new paradigm ML-dSGP4 is introduced that integrates dSGP4 with neural networks. This allows joint training of dSGP4 parameters and neural nets using backpropagation. Both inputs and outputs of dSGP4 can be corrected to match accurate ephemeris data while retaining computational speed.

Main Contributions:
- Open-sourced differentiable SGP4 program supporting automatic differentiation of inputs/outputs.
- Enables gradient-based tasks like optimization, orbit determination without finite differencing.
- Offers batch propagation leveraging parallel CPU/GPU hardware.
- Introduced ML-dSGP4 paradigm for accuracy improvement - joint training of dSGP4 and neural networks while retaining efficiency.
- Demonstrated superior performance of ML-dSGP4 over raw SGP4 and black-box neural network correctors in experiments.
- Overall, enabled integration of SGP4 with modern machine learning techniques for the first time to unlock accuracy and efficiency.

The summary covers the key problem being solved, the proposed dSGP4 solution and ML-dSGP4 paradigm, highlights the new capabilities enabled, and summarizes the experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed techniques.
