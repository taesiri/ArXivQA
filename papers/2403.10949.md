# [SelfIE: Self-Interpretation of Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10949)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are becoming the foundation for many applications, but they are largely black-boxes with limited transparency into their reasoning process and decision making. 
- Interpreting the representations and embeddings LLMs learn is important for establishing trust, revealing reasoning vs memorization, and directing model behaviors.  
- Prior work either requires extensive training data collection limited to a small predefined concepts or only provides short descriptions insufficient to explain complex reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SelfIE (Self-Interpretation of Embeddings), a framework where the LLM uses its own decoding capability to produce natural language interpretations of its internal hidden embeddings.
- By inserting an embedding into a separate "interpretation forward pass" and prompting the model to summarize the embedding, SelfIE generates textual explanations without needing any training.
- The method calculates a "relevancy score" to identify parts of the interpretation directly attributed to the interpreted embedding.
- SelfIE enables new forms of precise control over model behaviors by editing embeddings to target concepts based on the textual explanations.

Main Contributions:
- SelfIE achieves state-of-the-art performance in eliciting implicit world state knowledge from embeddings without any training, demonstrating it can effectively uncover concepts represented.
- Qualitative results and ablation studies validate SelfIE faithfully conveys information in embeddings and reveals internal reasoning procedures.
- Case studies demonstrate using SelfIE to understand complex behaviors like making ethical decisions, prompt injections, and reasoning processes.
- The textual explanations enable advanced forms of model control, like editing open-ended concepts or removing harmful knowledge, with either gradient descent or RL, outperforming prior control techniques.

In summary, SelfIE enables interpreting and controlling LLMs by leveraging their own decoding capacity to generate textual explanations of latent embeddings without needing extra supervision. Experiments highlight how this facilitates analyzing and directing model behaviors.
