# [Explore and Control with Adversarial Surprise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07394)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the introduction, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop an unsupervised reinforcement learning method that leads to the emergence of meaningful and complex behaviors in high-dimensional, stochastic environments?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) A good unsupervised RL method should balance exploration and control. Neither pure novelty-seeking nor pure surprise minimization succeeds on their own. 

2) Formulating the learning problem as a multi-agent competition can provide a mechanism for driving the emergence of complexity.

3) An information-theoretic objective focused on maximizing/minimizing surprise provides a general and principled way to achieve exploration and control in stochastic environments.

4) The proposed method, Adversarial Surprise, will outperform prior novelty-seeking, surprise minimization, and multi-agent competition methods, and lead to better coverage and more meaningful learned behaviors in complex, stochastic environments.

Does this seem like an accurate high-level summary of the core research question and hypotheses? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. The proposal of a new unsupervised reinforcement learning algorithm called Adversarial Surprise (AS). AS is based on an adversarial game between two policies - an Explore policy that seeks to maximize observation entropy/surprise, and a Control policy that tries to minimize it. 

2. A theoretical analysis showing that under certain assumptions, AS can fully explore the latent state space of stochastic Block MDP environments. This addresses limitations of prior surprise maximizing or minimizing methods in stochastic settings.

3. Empirical demonstrations that AS can effectively explore stochastic environments and attain better coverage than methods like RND, ASP, and SMiRL.

4. Experiments showing AS can learn meaningful emergent behaviors and achieve good zero-shot transfer performance in complex environments like Atari and VizDoom without any reward signal. This indicates it acquires useful skills, outperforming novelty seeking, surprise minimizing, and adversarial baselines. 

5. Results illustrating how the adversarial competition leads to the emergence of increasingly complex skills in phases, transitioning through several qualitatively distinct behaviors over the course of training.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be the proposal and empirical evaluation of the Adversarial Surprise algorithm, including theoretical and experimental support showing it is effective for exploration and skill discovery in stochastic settings compared to alternative approaches. The emergent curriculum results also help illustrate how the adversarial competition gives rise to progressively more sophisticated behaviors.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new unsupervised reinforcement learning method called Adversarial Surprise, which uses a two-player game between policies that try to maximize and minimize surprise/entropy over observations in order to drive the emergence of complex behaviors and enable effective exploration of stochastic, partially observed environments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some ways this paper compares to other research in unsupervised reinforcement learning:

- It builds on ideas from surprise minimization and the free energy principle like SMiRL, but incorporates surprise minimization into a two-player game to address limitations like the dark room problem. 

- It uses a multi-agent competition like Asymmetric Self Play (ASP) to drive emergence of complexity, but formulates the objective in terms of general information theoretic quantities instead of goal reaching, allowing it to work well in stochastic environments where ASP fails.

- It aims to balance exploration and control, avoiding issues in prior work of becoming stuck in high entropy "noisy TV" states or low entropy "dark room" states.

- It provides a theoretical analysis showing the method maximizes coverage of the state space in block MDPs, unlike other multi-agent or novelty seeking methods.

- Empirically it shows better exploration and state space coverage compared to novelty-seeking methods like RND and multi-agent methods like ASP.

- It demonstrates better zero-shot transfer performance in Atari and VizDoom compared to novelty seeking (RND), surprise minimization (SMiRL), and adversarial/multi-agent methods (ASP, AGAC).

To summarize, the key differences are:

1) Balancing exploration and control to avoid limitations of pure novelty seeking or surprise minimization

2) Being formulated in terms of general information theory objectives rather than goal reaching specifically

3) Providing theoretical guarantees on coverage in block MDPs

4) Empirically demonstrating improved exploration, coverage, and transfer over similar methods.

Let me know if you would like me to expand on any of these points!


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper does not explicitly suggest future research directions. It focuses on presenting the Adversarial Surprise algorithm and evaluating its performance on exploration, zero-shot transfer, and emergence of complex behaviors in stochastic block MDPs, Atari games, and ViZDoom. 

Based on the paper's findings and limitations, some potential future research directions could include:

- Evaluating Adversarial Surprise on a broader range of environments beyond block MDPs, Atari, and ViZDoom to further demonstrate generality.

- Combining Adversarial Surprise with hierarchical RL by training a meta-policy to decide when to invoke the Explore vs Control sub-policies. This could help balance exploration and exploitation.

- Using Adversarial Surprise for skill acquisition in complex domains like robotics, where the unsupervised behaviors could facilitate downstream task learning.

- Extending the theoretical analysis beyond block MDPs to characterize the conditions under which Adversarial Surprise provably maximizes state coverage. 

- Comparing Adversarial Surprise to a wider range of unsupervised RL techniques like DIAYN, EMPOWERMENT, etc.

- Studying whether the skills and exploration strategies learned by Adversarial Surprise transfer to unseen tasks, not just within the same environment.

- Developing extensions of Adversarial Surprise that combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, rather than being purely unsupervised.

So in summary, the main directions are: 1) broader evaluation, 2) hierarchical extensions, 3) real-world applications like robotics, 4) more general theory, 5) comparison to more baselines, 6) studying transfer, and 7) combinations with extrinsic rewards.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The free energy principle proposes that biological agents minimize surprise or state entropy to remain in safe, stable states. The surprise-minimizing RL algorithm SMiRL implements this idea, and learns behaviors that reduce entropy in stochastic environments, even without external rewards. However, SMiRL struggles in partially observed environments, where it can fall prey to the "dark room problem" - remaining in predictable but uninteresting parts of the state space and not learning meaningful behaviors. The proposed method, Adversarial Surprise (AS), builds on surprise minimization but incorporates it into a two-player game to alleviate this issue. In AS, one policy tries to minimize surprise while another policy acts to maximize surprise for the first, forcing it out of dark rooms. Experiments show AS explores more thoroughly and learns more complex skills than SMiRL and other baselines in stochastic, partially observed environments.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes a new unsupervised reinforcement learning method called Adversarial Surprise (AS) that is designed to balance exploration and control. AS is based on an adversarial game between two policies - an Explore policy that seeks to maximize surprise, and a Control policy that aims to minimize surprise. The Explore policy puts the agent into novel situations, while the Control policy must recover by manipulating the environment into more predictable states. By competing over observation entropy, the two policies drive increasingly complex exploration and control behavior. 

The authors provide a theoretical analysis showing that AS can fully explore the state space of stochastic block MDPs, overcoming limitations like the "noisy TV" and "dark room" problems. Empirically, they demonstrate that AS outperforms prior unsupervised RL methods like RND, SMiRL and ASP on measures of state space coverage and zero-shot transfer in Atari/VizDoom environments. The emergent behaviors learned by AS exhibit clear transitions in complexity, eventually solving challenging exploration/control problems. Overall, AS offers a way to balance exploration and control for unsupervised learning without requiring hand-crafted rewards.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The free energy principle suggests that biological agents minimize surprise, or state entropy, in order to remain in safe and stable states. The paper builds on this idea using a method called Surprise Minimizing RL (SMiRL), where an agent is trained to minimize entropy in its observations. This leads the agent to learn behaviors that stabilize otherwise chaotic environments, even without external rewards. However, SMiRL can fail in partially observed environments, where the agent remains in low entropy states and does not explore. To address this, the authors incorporate surprise minimization into a two-player game between a Control agent that minimizes surprise, and an Explore agent that maximizes it. By competing over entropy, the Control agent is driven out of low entropy states and must learn more complex behaviors to control its observations. This alleviates the limitations of pure surprise minimization.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of developing unsupervised reinforcement learning methods that can learn useful behaviors without external rewards, while avoiding common failure modes like getting distracted by unpredictable elements (the "noisy TV problem") or not exploring at all (the "dark room problem"). The key ideas and contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a new unsupervised RL method called Adversarial Surprise (AS) based on an adversarial game between two policies that compete over the amount of surprise/entropy the agent experiences. 

- One policy (Explore) tries to maximize surprise, the other (Control) tries to minimize it, creating a natural tension and curriculum.

- Providing theoretical results that show AS can fully explore the state space under certain assumptions, avoiding the "noisy TV" and "dark room" problems.

- Empirical evaluations across a range of environments like MiniGrid, Atari and VizDoom showing AS outperforms prior unsupervised RL methods like RND, ASP and SMiRL in terms of state space coverage and learning useful behaviors without rewards.

- Demonstrating that the competiting policies in AS lead to the emergence of complex skills through clear phase transitions in agent behavior over time.

The key novelty seems to be in formulating the adversarial surprise objective and showing theoretically and empirically how it balances exploration and control better than prior approaches, enabling more effective unsupervised skill discovery.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Unsupervised reinforcement learning - The paper focuses on developing reinforcement learning techniques that can learn useful behaviors without reward functions designed for specific tasks.

- Intrinsic motivation - The paper proposes using intrinsic motivation techniques like curiosity and empowerment to guide unsupervised learning. These provide task-agnostic objectives for the agent to optimize.

- Adversarial game - The proposed method involves an adversarial game between two policies controlling the same agent. One policy tries to maximize surprise/entropy while the other tries to minimize it. 

- Exploration vs control - A key idea in the paper is balancing exploration to find novel states against learning control to reduce surprise. The adversarial game induces this balance.

- Emergence of complexity - The competition between policies drives an "arms race" where agents have to learn increasingly complex skills, leading to emergent complexity.

- Noisy TV problem - A common failure mode where novelty-seeking RL agents get stuck exploring stochastic elements like static on a TV. Addressed by the control policy.

- Dark room problem - Surprise minimizing agents may take trivial actions like staying in an empty room. Addressed by the explore policy.

- Block MDP - Theoretical analysis relies on a variant of MDPs with disjoint observation sets per state. Allows analyzing latent state space coverage.

- Zero-shot transfer - Evaluates if unsupervised learned behaviors transfer well to downstream tasks, without any task-specific training.

So in summary, key terms cover the setting (unsupervised RL), approach (adversarial game, intrinsic motivation), problems addressed (noisy TV, dark room), theoretical analysis (block MDPs), and evaluation (zero-shot transfer, emergence of complexity).

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a new unsupervised reinforcement learning method called Adversarial Surprise (AS) for learning meaningful behaviors in complex, stochastic environments without external rewards. It formulates AS as a two-player game between an Explore policy that seeks to maximize observation entropy, and a Control policy that aims to minimize observation entropy by manipulating the environment. The competition between these policies drives an emergent curriculum of increasingly complex skills. They provide theoretical results proving AS can fully explore stochastic block MDPs, unlike prior novelty-seeking or surprise-minimization methods. Empirically, AS outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised RL methods like RND, ASP, AGAC and SMiRL on metrics of state coverage and zero-shot transfer performance in Atari, VizDoom and procedurally generated environments. Videos show AS discovers interesting skills like locking doors, picking up keys, and shooting enemies without any rewards. The results demonstrate that the balanced objectives of exploration and control incentivize acquisition of meaningful behaviors, while avoiding distraction by uncontrolled stochasticity. Overall, the work makes important contributions towards developing unsupervised agents that can autonomously acquire reusable skills.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an unsupervised reinforcement learning method called Adversarial Surprise (AS) that is designed for high-dimensional, stochastic environments. The method involves an adversarial game between two policies - Explore and Control - that take turns controlling the same agent. The Explore policy seeks to maximize surprise or observation entropy for the Control policy by taking the agent to novel states. The Control policy aims to minimize surprise by manipulating the environment to return the agent to more familiar, predictable states. This competition pushes the agents to seek out increasingly surprising situations while gaining mastery over them, leading to complex emergent behaviors. The authors provide theoretical analysis showing AS maximizes coverage of the underlying state space in stochastic block MDPs. Empirically, AS outperforms prior unsupervised RL methods like RND, ASP, AGAC and SMiRL in terms of state space coverage and zero-shot transfer performance on Atari and VizDoom environments. The results demonstrate AS is effective at exploration and learning meaningful skills without external rewards.
