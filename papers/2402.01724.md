# [CERM: Context-aware Literature-based Discovery via Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional sentiment analysis methods fail to capture the sentiment between two entities mentioned in a sentence, as the overall sentence sentiment may not reflect the relationship sentiment.
- Labeling data for sentiment analysis is expensive and time-consuming. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new sentiment analysis task called Entity Relationship Sentiment Analysis (ERSA) to predict the sentiment polarity of an entity pair's relationship mentioned in a sentence.
- Propose a semi-supervised model called Context-aware Entity Relationship Prediction Model (CERM) that combines static and contextualized word embeddings to generate rich representations tailored for the ERSA task. 
- Utilize consistency regularization and similarity learning losses to enable semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data.

Main Contributions:
- Define the new ERSA task to enable concept pair relationship inference from biomedical texts through sentiment analysis.
- Propose the CERM model that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised text classification methods on the ERSA task.
- Introduce a dataset to facilitate research in the literature-based sentiment analysis domain.
- Demonstrate CERM's effectiveness by evaluating performance on the Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis task.

In summary, this paper introduced the ERSA task and CERM model to predict relationship sentiment between entities using limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Experiments showed superior performance over existing methods. The introduced dataset enables further research in this domain.
