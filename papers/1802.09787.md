# [Relational Reasoning for Markov Chains in a Probabilistic Guarded Lambda   Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09787)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How to develop a programming and reasoning framework for probabilistic computations over infinite objects like Markov chains?

The key contributions that address this question are:

1. Developing a probabilistic extension of the simply-typed guarded λ-calculus to model probabilistic computations over infinite data types like streams. This allows representing Markov chains as probability distributions over streams.

2. Defining a relational program logic based on probabilistic couplings to reason about relational properties of probabilistic guarded terms. This supports both syntax-directed and more flexible relational reasoning.

3. Extending the relational logic with shift couplings that relate states of two Markov chains at different times. This enables proofs of properties that require relating states of chains asynchronously. 

4. Demonstrating the expressiveness of the logic by verifying examples inspired from information flow control, convergence of numerical algorithms, and properties of random walks. Several of these were infeasible to verify in prior relational program logics.

In summary, the paper develops a programming language and logic tailored to probabilistic computations on infinite data types, with applications to specifying and verifying properties of Markov chains. The logic supports both synchronous and asynchronous relational reasoning about probabilistic processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops a probabilistic extension of the simply-typed guarded λ-calculus. This provides a framework for programming and reasoning about infinite stochastic processes like Markov chains. The key idea is to model Markov chains as distributions over streams, leveraging the approximation of streams by their finite prefixes in the topos of trees. This avoids the need for measure theory.

2. It presents a relational program logic for verifying relational properties of probabilistic guarded computations. The logic supports both synchronous and asynchronous reasoning, going beyond equivalence properties. For probabilistic expressions, it is based on couplings rather than explicit reasoning about probabilities. It also improves over prior coupling-based logics by supporting Strassen's theorem and relating expressions of different types.

3. It extends the relational reasoning principles to support "shift couplings", which relate the states of two Markov chains at different times. This is motivated by similar techniques from the Markov chain literature, and goes beyond what conventional relational logics can express.

4. It demonstrates the logic by verifying several examples involving probabilistic noninterference, stochastic dominance, and random walks. These are challenging examples that could not be verified by prior systems.

5. It proves soundness of the logic by giving a model in the topos of trees and using couplings for the semantics of probabilistic assertions.

In summary, the main contribution is a probabilistic extension of guarded lambda calculus along with an expressive relational logic that can verify challenging properties of probabilistic computations over infinite objects like Markov chains. The logic supports both syntax-directed and logical reasoning styles.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on a probabilistic guarded lambda calculus compares to other related work:

- Compared to prior work on guarded recursion and coinduction, this paper extends the simply-typed guarded lambda calculus with probabilities. It provides a denotational semantics using the topos of trees, allowing modeling of infinite streams and Markov chains as probability distributions. The logic supports relational reasoning about probabilistic computations over infinite datatypes.

- Compared to other relational logics like RHOL, this work adapts the ideas to a setting with guarded recursion and probabilities. It supports syntax-directed relational proofs but also comparisons between programs of different types/structures. The logic leverages probabilistic couplings for reasoning about relations between distributions.

- Compared to other formalizations of probabilistic programming, a key novelty is support for reasoning about infinite datatypes and processes like Markov chains. This is enabled by the guarded lambda calculus. The logic also improves over prior coupling-based relational logics by supporting couplings between different types and using Strassen's theorem to justify the proof rules.

- Compared to other verification techniques for probabilistic programs, this work is based on denotational semantics rather than bisimulations or logical relations. It focuses on relational properties rather than just equivalence. The coupling-based techniques provide compositional reasoning while avoiding complex probabilistic calculations.

- Compared to earlier guarded type theories, this paper presents the first relational logic for guarded recursion and shows how to model and formally verify properties of probabilistic systems with infinite behavior. The shift coupling examples motivate new proof techniques compared to earlier relational logics.

In summary, the key novelties are supporting reasoning over infinite probabilistic processes based on the guarded lambda calculus, and developing an expressive relational logic tailored to this setting with couplings and support for programs with different types/structures.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the programming language with more features like dependent types and clock variables. This would allow modeling more complex probabilistic computations.

- Developing approximate couplings and differential privacy for infinite streams, building on prior work that considers large finite lists. This could enable new applications in privacy-preserving data analysis.

- Incorporating continuous probability distributions in the framework. The current paper focuses on discrete distributions to avoid measure theory, but extending to continuous distributions could broaden the applicability.

- Exploring other application domains beyond Markov chains, such as statistical physics models and quantitative information flow. The probabilistic relational reasoning framework could potentially be useful in these areas.

- Implementing the logic in a proof assistant. This could facilitate mechanized, machine-checked proofs about probabilistic relational properties.

- Comparing the coupling-based relational logic to operationally-based techniques like probabilistic bisimulations and logical relations. This could provide insight into the relative strengths of each approach.

In summary, the main directions involve extending the programming language features, developing new applications of the relational reasoning approach, broadening the class of probabilistic models supported, and implementing and evaluating the logic in proof assistants. Exploring connections to other relational reasoning techniques is also suggested.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a probabilistic extension of the simply-typed guarded λ-calculus and a relational logic for reasoning about probabilistic computations over potentially infinite data structures. The key ideas are:

- The simply-typed guarded λ-calculus is extended with discrete probability distributions to model probabilistic computations over streams. The semantics is given via a model in the topos of trees, avoiding measure-theoretic complications. 

- A relational logic is developed on top of higher-order logic for the probabilistic guarded λ-calculus. The logic supports both synchronous and asynchronous reasoning principles to relate probabilistic computations over streams, going beyond just proving equivalences. 

- Probabilistic couplings and Strassen's theorem are used to justify sound proof rules for relating probabilistic expressions. This gives greater expressivity compared to requiring bijections between sampling spaces.

- The logic is shown to be sound, consistent, and equivalent to reasoning directly in higher-order logic. Several examples are formalized, including proofs using shift couplings relating random walks.

In summary, the paper develops a framework for programming and relational reasoning about probabilistic computations over potentially infinite data like streams, with applications to specifying and verifying properties of stochastic processes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper presents a probabilistic extension of the simply-typed guarded λ-calculus and an associated program logic for reasoning about relational properties of guarded probabilistic computations. The simply-typed guarded λ-calculus allows modeling of infinite stochastic processes like Markov chains by distinguishing data available now versus data available later using modalities. This paper extends the calculus with discrete probability distributions and interprets it in the topos of trees, avoiding the need for measure theoretic machinery even for reasoning about distributions over infinite types. The relational program logic supports syntax-directed proofs in the style of relational refinement types but also allows escaping the syntax-directed discipline to relate expressions with different types/structures. The logic leverages probabilistic couplings and applies them to relate distributions over different discrete types. Several examples are presented that were previously beyond the scope of such relational reasoning systems, including proofs using shift couplings and lumpability.

In more detail, the paper presents the probabilistic guarded λ-calculus along with its denotational semantics in the topos of trees. It then introduces a relational logic on top of a guarded higher-order logic to enable both synchronous and asynchronous reasoning. For the probabilistic fragment, the logic uses couplings as the main relational assertion between distributions. Key technical results include the equivalence of the relational logic with the underlying guarded logic, soundness with respect to the topos-theoretic semantics, and an embedding lemma allowing reuse of unary proofs. The expressiveness of the logic is demonstrated through varied examples including probabilistic noninterference, stochastic dominance, and shift couplings between random walks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a probabilistic extension of the simply-typed guarded lambda calculus, and develops a relational logic based on couplings to reason about probabilistic computations in this language. The logic supports syntax-directed proofs to exploit similarities between programs, but also enables falling back to pure logical reasoning when programs have different structure. To handle infinite probabilistic processes like Markov chains, the logic leverages the later modality from guarded type theory to deal with productive recursion. The logic is given a denotational semantics in the topos of trees, where probability distributions are modeled as sequences of finite approximations. Key results established include soundness of the logic, metatheoretical properties like equivalence with the internal logic of the topos of trees, and examples demonstrating the expressiveness of relational reasoning about couplings in this setting.
