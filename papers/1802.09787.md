# [Relational Reasoning for Markov Chains in a Probabilistic Guarded Lambda   Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09787)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How to develop a programming and reasoning framework for probabilistic computations over infinite objects like Markov chains?The key contributions that address this question are:1. Developing a probabilistic extension of the simply-typed guarded λ-calculus to model probabilistic computations over infinite data types like streams. This allows representing Markov chains as probability distributions over streams.2. Defining a relational program logic based on probabilistic couplings to reason about relational properties of probabilistic guarded terms. This supports both syntax-directed and more flexible relational reasoning.3. Extending the relational logic with shift couplings that relate states of two Markov chains at different times. This enables proofs of properties that require relating states of chains asynchronously. 4. Demonstrating the expressiveness of the logic by verifying examples inspired from information flow control, convergence of numerical algorithms, and properties of random walks. Several of these were infeasible to verify in prior relational program logics.In summary, the paper develops a programming language and logic tailored to probabilistic computations on infinite data types, with applications to specifying and verifying properties of Markov chains. The logic supports both synchronous and asynchronous relational reasoning about probabilistic processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It develops a probabilistic extension of the simply-typed guarded λ-calculus. This provides a framework for programming and reasoning about infinite stochastic processes like Markov chains. The key idea is to model Markov chains as distributions over streams, leveraging the approximation of streams by their finite prefixes in the topos of trees. This avoids the need for measure theory.2. It presents a relational program logic for verifying relational properties of probabilistic guarded computations. The logic supports both synchronous and asynchronous reasoning, going beyond equivalence properties. For probabilistic expressions, it is based on couplings rather than explicit reasoning about probabilities. It also improves over prior coupling-based logics by supporting Strassen's theorem and relating expressions of different types.3. It extends the relational reasoning principles to support "shift couplings", which relate the states of two Markov chains at different times. This is motivated by similar techniques from the Markov chain literature, and goes beyond what conventional relational logics can express.4. It demonstrates the logic by verifying several examples involving probabilistic noninterference, stochastic dominance, and random walks. These are challenging examples that could not be verified by prior systems.5. It proves soundness of the logic by giving a model in the topos of trees and using couplings for the semantics of probabilistic assertions.In summary, the main contribution is a probabilistic extension of guarded lambda calculus along with an expressive relational logic that can verify challenging properties of probabilistic computations over infinite objects like Markov chains. The logic supports both syntax-directed and logical reasoning styles.
