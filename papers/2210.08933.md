# DiffuSeq: Sequence to Sequence Text Generation with Diffusion Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper is proposing DiffuSeq, which is a diffusion model designed for sequence-to-sequence text generation tasks. The central hypothesis is that DiffuSeq can achieve high quality and diversity in text generation by extending diffusion models to handle the conditional sequence generation setting. Specifically, the key research questions addressed are:- How to adapt diffusion models from unconditional to conditional text generation, where the model must generate a target text sequence conditioned on a source text sequence?- Can diffusion models match or exceed the performance of autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on sequence-to-sequence text generation tasks in terms of both quality and diversity?- What theoretical connections exist between autoregressive, non-autoregressive, and diffusion models for text generation?To summarize, the central hypothesis is that diffusion models like the proposed DiffuSeq can achieve state-of-the-art performance on conditional text generation by generating highly diverse outputs without sacrificing quality. The key research questions focus on adapting diffusion models to the sequence-to-sequence setting and demonstrating their effectiveness empirically and theoretically compared to other text generation paradigms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing DiffuSeq, the first diffusion model for sequence-to-sequence text generation in continuous space. DiffuSeq uses a classifier-free approach to conditional text generation by jointly modeling the source and target sequences within a single model. 2. Establishing theoretical connections between autoregressive (AR), non-autoregressive (NAR), and diffusion models for text generation. The authors show DiffuSeq can be seen as an extension of iterative NAR models.3. Empirical evaluation on a diverse set of sequence-to-sequence tasks demonstrating DiffuSeq matches or exceeds the performance of competitive AR, NAR, and pre-trained language models in terms of both quality and diversity of generated text.4. Analysis providing insights into DiffuSeq's behavior, including how diversity ensures quality, comparison to iterative NAR models, and inference speed trade-offs. 5. Overall, introducing and validating diffusion as a promising new paradigm for conditional text generation, with unique advantages over AR and NAR approaches. The results help demonstrate the potential for diffusion models in complex language generation tasks.So in summary, the main contributions appear to be: 1) proposing the novel DiffuSeq model, 2) theoretical analysis connecting it to other paradigms, 3) empirical results demonstrating strong performance, 4) analysis providing model insights, and 5) highlighting diffusion as a new direction for conditional NLG.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on DiffuSeq compares to other related research on diffusion models and text generation:- Most prior work on adapting diffusion models to text generation has focused on unconditional language modeling, generating free-form text. This paper proposes DiffuSeq as the first diffusion model capable of conditional text generation in a sequence-to-sequence setting.- Other conditional text generation models like GPT-2 suffer from a "degeneration" problem and lack diversity. DiffuSeq is shown to produce more diverse outputs without sacrificing quality.- The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrating DiffuSeq's potential. It establishes connections between DiffuSeq and autoregressive/non-autoregressive models, showing it is an extension of iterative non-autoregressive models.- Many prior diffusion models for text rely on pre-trained components like classifiers or alignments between modalities. DiffuSeq is an end-to-end classifier-free approach specifically designed for sequence-to-sequence text tasks.- Evaluation across several text generation tasks shows DiffuSeq achieving comparable or better performance than strong baselines like fine-tuned GPT-2 models and other non-autoregressive methods.- The design of DiffuSeq differs from some multimodal diffusion models in vision that use fixed embeddings for conditioning text. The joint training strategy used in DiffuSeq is shown to be more effective.Overall, the paper demonstrates diffusion models, previously focused on continuous data like images, can be adapted for complex discrete sequence generation tasks and provide benefits over other leading approaches. The proposed DiffuSeq model offers a promising new direction for conditional text generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper does not explicitly suggest future research directions. However, based on the content and findings, some potential future research directions could include:- Exploring ways to improve the inference speed and scalability of diffusion models for text generation. The authors note that the slow sampling speed remains a major limitation of current diffusion models. - Investigating techniques to further bridge the gap between diffusion models and autoregressive/non-autoregressive models in terms of text fluency and coherence. The results show diffusion models match or exceed baselines on diversity but still lag on some fluency metrics.- Leveraging pre-training techniques like BERT to enhance the semantic understanding and token-level choice of diffusion models. The authors suggest this could help address areas where diffusion models currently underperform compared to pre-trained language models.- Applying diffusion models to other complex conditional text generation tasks beyond the four explored in the paper, such as dialogue, summarization, translation, etc. This could further demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.- Extending the theoretical analysis to better understand the connections and differences between diffusion, autoregressive, and non-autoregressive models for text.- Developing better ranking/selection methods to fully exploit the high diversity of diffusion models to improve final text quality.So in summary, some promising future work could focus on improving inference speed, text quality, semantic understanding via pre-training, applying the approach to more tasks, extending the theoretical analysis, and developing better ranking techniques for high-quality selection.
