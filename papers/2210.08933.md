# DiffuSeq: Sequence to Sequence Text Generation with Diffusion Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper is proposing DiffuSeq, which is a diffusion model designed for sequence-to-sequence text generation tasks. The central hypothesis is that DiffuSeq can achieve high quality and diversity in text generation by extending diffusion models to handle the conditional sequence generation setting. Specifically, the key research questions addressed are:- How to adapt diffusion models from unconditional to conditional text generation, where the model must generate a target text sequence conditioned on a source text sequence?- Can diffusion models match or exceed the performance of autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on sequence-to-sequence text generation tasks in terms of both quality and diversity?- What theoretical connections exist between autoregressive, non-autoregressive, and diffusion models for text generation?To summarize, the central hypothesis is that diffusion models like the proposed DiffuSeq can achieve state-of-the-art performance on conditional text generation by generating highly diverse outputs without sacrificing quality. The key research questions focus on adapting diffusion models to the sequence-to-sequence setting and demonstrating their effectiveness empirically and theoretically compared to other text generation paradigms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing DiffuSeq, the first diffusion model for sequence-to-sequence text generation in continuous space. DiffuSeq uses a classifier-free approach to conditional text generation by jointly modeling the source and target sequences within a single model. 2. Establishing theoretical connections between autoregressive (AR), non-autoregressive (NAR), and diffusion models for text generation. The authors show DiffuSeq can be seen as an extension of iterative NAR models.3. Empirical evaluation on a diverse set of sequence-to-sequence tasks demonstrating DiffuSeq matches or exceeds the performance of competitive AR, NAR, and pre-trained language models in terms of both quality and diversity of generated text.4. Analysis providing insights into DiffuSeq's behavior, including how diversity ensures quality, comparison to iterative NAR models, and inference speed trade-offs. 5. Overall, introducing and validating diffusion as a promising new paradigm for conditional text generation, with unique advantages over AR and NAR approaches. The results help demonstrate the potential for diffusion models in complex language generation tasks.So in summary, the main contributions appear to be: 1) proposing the novel DiffuSeq model, 2) theoretical analysis connecting it to other paradigms, 3) empirical results demonstrating strong performance, 4) analysis providing model insights, and 5) highlighting diffusion as a new direction for conditional NLG.
