## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Agriculture needs to improve food production to address global warming and population growth. Agricultural robotics can help by automating complex tasks currently done by humans. 
- However, agricultural tasks require varying robot configurations, making development and adoption expensive. 
- Modular and reconfigurable robots can reduce costs and enable incremental upgrades suited to each task.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present Hefty, a modular and highly reconfigurable agricultural mobile manipulation robot. 
- Hefty builds on the Farm-ng Amiga robot, adding reconfigurability in mobility, sensing, power, computing and mounting fixtures.
- The structural design uses steel tubes and aluminum extrusions for adjustable sensor and tool mounting.  
- The custom computer system runs ROS and supports diverse sensors and deep learning models.
- Modular power, control and communication systems connect components.

Contributions:
- A system design approach for an agricultural utility robot that is modular and reconfigurable.  
- Demonstrated usage in five configurations: navigation, insect scouting, sensor insertion, pepper harvesting and lantern fly egg removal.
- Enables researchers to determine optimal configurations while reducing platform costs.
- Steps towards affordable automation to relieve agricultural labor shortages.
- Standard platform can accelerate technology transfer from research to real-world deployment.

In summary, the paper presents a versatile agricultural robot design that can be reconfigured for diverse tasks to make agricultural automation more practical and affordable.
