# [A Robust Tube-Based Smooth-MPC for Robot Manipulator Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09693)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Model predictive control (MPC) shows excellent performance for optimizing and constraining robot manipulator systems. However, solving the optimal control problem (OCP) at each time step is computationally expensive, causing delays between state sampling and control input. This limits applying MPC to fast, resource-constrained robot systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a robust tube-based smooth MPC strategy that improves smoothness and reduces control delay. 
- Predict the region the system state will reach after the computation delay using the nominal system model. Solve next OCP early using this predicted state to eliminate delay.
- Linearize the nonlinear dynamics with bounded error to simplify the OCP and improve solve speed.

Main Contributions:
- Predict future disturbed state set of the real system using nominal system states. Allows solving next OCP early, eliminating control delay.
- Adopt piecewise linearization of nonlinear model to reduce OCP complexity. Error bound ensures similarity to nonlinear model.  
- Proves recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed smooth MPC approach under system constraints and disturbances.
- Simulation results verify performance matches optimal MPC without delay and outperforms standard time-triggered MPC.

In summary, the paper develops a tube MPC strategy to predict future states and solve OCPs early, enabling optimal control of fast robot systems without control delay. Key enablers are disturbed state set prediction and piecewise linearization.
