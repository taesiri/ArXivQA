# [A Robust Tube-Based Smooth-MPC for Robot Manipulator Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09693)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Model predictive control (MPC) shows excellent performance for optimizing and constraining robot manipulator systems. However, solving the optimal control problem (OCP) at each time step is computationally expensive, causing delays between state sampling and control input. This limits applying MPC to fast, resource-constrained robot systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a robust tube-based smooth MPC strategy that improves smoothness and reduces control delay. 
- Predict the region the system state will reach after the computation delay using the nominal system model. Solve next OCP early using this predicted state to eliminate delay.
- Linearize the nonlinear dynamics with bounded error to simplify the OCP and improve solve speed.

Main Contributions:
- Predict future disturbed state set of the real system using nominal system states. Allows solving next OCP early, eliminating control delay.
- Adopt piecewise linearization of nonlinear model to reduce OCP complexity. Error bound ensures similarity to nonlinear model.  
- Proves recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed smooth MPC approach under system constraints and disturbances.
- Simulation results verify performance matches optimal MPC without delay and outperforms standard time-triggered MPC.

In summary, the paper develops a tube MPC strategy to predict future states and solve OCPs early, enabling optimal control of fast robot systems without control delay. Key enablers are disturbed state set prediction and piecewise linearization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a robust tube-based smooth model predictive control strategy for nonlinear robot manipulator systems that eliminates control delay and ensures stability and optimality by predicting the state set of the real system and linearizing the model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

(i) It develops a method to predict the region of the future real system states by deducing the deviation bound between the real and nominal system states. This allows solving the optimal control problem (OCP) ahead of time to eliminate control delays.

(ii) It linearizes the nonlinear robot manipulator system dynamics with a bound on the linearization error. This reduces the computational complexity of solving the OCP at each time step. 

(iii) It proposes a novel robust tube-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy that ensures recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability for the nonlinear robot manipulator system with constraints and disturbances. This control strategy combines state prediction, piecewise linearization, and tube MPC theory.

In summary, the key contribution is the design of a computationally efficient MPC strategy that can eliminate control delays for nonlinear robotic manipulator systems. This is achieved by predicting future states to solve the OCP early and linearizing the dynamics to simplify the OCP. Theoretical analysis proves recursive feasibility and stability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper linearizes the nonlinear system dynamics using a second-order Taylor expansion. What are the limitations of using only a second-order approximation? Could higher order expansions improve performance?

2. The paper assumes the disturbances are bounded. How would performance degrade if the disturbances were unbounded or grew over time? Could the method be extended to handle unbounded disturbances?

3. The paper predicts the region containing the future real system states. What other techniques could be used to predict or bound the future states, and how might they compare? 

4. The paper uses a tube-based MPC approach. How does the performance compare to other robust MPC methods like min-max MPC? What are the tradeoffs?

5. How sensitive is the method to inaccuracies in the model and disturbance bounds used for prediction? Could adaptive techniques be used to update estimates online?

6. The paper linearizes the model at each sampling instant. How much does linearization error impact stability and performance? Are there online methods to reduce linearization error?

7. What impact does the length of the prediction horizon have on stability and performance? How should the prediction horizon be selected?

8. How does the computational delay handled by this method compare to delays handled by other MPC techniques like input delay compensation?

9. The paper considers a 3-link manipulator. How well would the method extend to systems with higher degrees of freedom or more complex dynamics?

10. The method is validated in simulation. What practical issues might arise when implemented on real hardware that are not captured in simulation?
