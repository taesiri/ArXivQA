# [WorldDreamer: Towards General World Models for Video Generation via   Predicting Masked Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09985)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing world models are limited to specific domains like gaming or autonomous driving, lacking the ability to model the complexity of general real-world dynamic environments. This restricts their capability for video generation. Therefore, the authors propose WorldDreamer, the first general world model for comprehensive video generation.

Method:
WorldDreamer frames world modeling as an unsupervised visual sequence modeling problem by predicting masked tokens similar to language models. It tokenizes video frames into discrete visual tokens using VQGAN, randomly masks some tokens, and tries to predict those masked tokens based on visible ones. This allows implicitly modeling motion and physics.  

Additionally, a Spatial Temporal Patchwise Transformer (STPT) is proposed to focus attention on local spacetime patches, aiding in learning visual dynamics. Multimodal signals like text and actions are integrated via cross-attention to steer video generation. Compared to diffusion models, WorldDreamer allows efficient parallel decoding in 10 steps rather than 30+ steps.

Contributions:
1) First general world model for video generation that learns to capture real-world dynamics.
2) Proposes STPT architecture to focus attention on local patches to learn dynamics better. 
3) Shows state-of-the-art video generation on diverse tasks like text/image to video, video prediction, inpainting, and stylization across different environments like nature and driving scenes.

In summary, WorldDreamer pioneers general world modeling for comprehensive video generation by framing it as a masked visual token prediction problem and proposes architectural innovations to effectively capture real-world dynamics.
