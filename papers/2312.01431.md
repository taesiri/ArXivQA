# [D$^2$ST-Adapter: Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter for   Few-shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Adapting large pre-trained image models to few-shot action recognition is an effective strategy, but typical fine-tuning methods are prone to overfitting and offer little flexibility to model temporal video features. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose D^2ST-Adapter, a novel adapter tuning framework with two key designs:
   1) Dual pathway architecture that disentangles spatial and temporal feature learning
   2) Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention (DSTA) module to enable global modeling of spatial and temporal features

Key Contributions:
- Design an adapter tuning framework tailored for few-shot action recognition
   - Dual pathways for disentangled spatial and temporal modeling
   - Configurable DSTA modules for global modeling of each pathway
- Instantiate D^2ST-Adapter with ResNet and ViT backbones
- Achieve state-of-the-art results on five few-shot action recognition benchmarks
   - Particularly effective on datasets requiring temporal reasoning 
- Demonstrate efficiency of adapter tuning versus full fine-tuning
- Perform comprehensive ablation studies on design choices

In summary, this paper presents a specialized adapter tuning framework for few-shot action recognition that disentangles spatial and temporal feature learning. The deformable attention mechanism enables global spatio-temporal feature transformations while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments validate effectiveness especially when temporal dynamics are critical and generalization ability across different backbones and datasets.
