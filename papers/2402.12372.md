# [HunFlair2 in a cross-corpus evaluation of biomedical named entity   recognition and normalization tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12372)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) and normalization (NEN) are crucial steps in biomedical text mining pipelines. However, most tools are evaluated on the same corpus they are trained on (in-corpus), which does not reflect real-world performance when applied to new texts (in the wild). This paper investigates how current state-of-the-art biomedical NER and NEN tools perform in a cross-corpus setting.

Methodology:
- Selected 5 mature biomedical NER and NEN tools based on criteria like availability, feature richness, and license requirements. The tools were PubTator, BERN2, SciSpacy, bent, and HunFlair2 (an updated version of HunFlair).

- Tools were evaluated on 3 biomedical corpora covering 4 entity types (genes, diseases, chemicals, species) that were explicitly not used in training by any tool.

- Micro average F1 score was used as the evaluation metric at the mention level. Predictions had to match gold spans and identifiers to be considered correct.

Results:
- Performance of all tools dropped considerably compared to published in-corpus results, with average F1 scores being 36-59% versus typically >80% for in-corpus.

- HunFlair2 performed best overall with 59% F1, followed by PubTator (54%). HunFlair2 was best at extracting chemicals and diseases, PubTator at genes and species.

- Analysis showed tools struggled with less frequent entities versus very common ones like "mouse" genes.

- NER-only experiments showed robust models but big NEN performance gaps.

Contributions:
- First large-scale cross-corpus evaluation of state-of-the-art biomedical NER and NEN tools.

- Addition of an improved neural NEN module to HunFlair tool â†’ HunFlair2.

- Demonstrated significant real-world performance declines versus published in-corpus results.

- Showed need for more generalization in tools to handle new biomedical subdomains and text types robustly.

In summary, the paper clearly highlighted limitations of current biomedical NER and NEN tools in realistic application scenarios and identified areas needing more research to make such tools more robust. The newly developed HunFlair2 tool achieved the most stable performance across domains.
