## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Robust Node Representation Learning via Graph Variational Diffusion Networks":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for node representation learning in attributed graphs. However, GNNs can be vulnerable to perturbations in the graph structure, such as changes in edges. This can substantially deteriorate the performance of node classification tasks that rely on GNNs. 

- Existing methods to improve robustness like topological denoising in the pre-processing stage or mechanism design in the inter-processing stage have limitations. Bayesian label transition methods in the post-processing stage rely heavily on the quality of predictions on the training data.

- Simply increasing the percentage of Gaussian noise in GNN hidden layers to enhance robustness leads to over-smoothing issues during node aggregation, causing node embeddings to become less distinct.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes a Graph Variational Diffusion Network (GVDN), a new node encoder, to generate robust node embeddings. 

- GVDN manipulates Gaussian noise to improve robustness while alleviating over-smoothing issues using two key mechanisms:
  1) Gaussian Diffusion: Linearly decreases the extent of Gaussian noise over successive iterations to help train a robust model.
  2) Node Embedding Propagation: Propagates node embeddings of inaccurately predicted nodes to neighboring nodes selected using a topology-based sampler during training to further strengthen robustness.

- A retraining mechanism is designed using the GVDN-generated node embeddings to recover node classification performance on perturbed graphs.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes GVDN, the first model to combine variational diffusion and node embedding propagation to safeguard robustness against perturbations while reducing over-smoothing issues.

- Designs a retraining procedure using GVDN-generated node embeddings to recover performance of node classification on perturbed graphs, without needing a well-constructed prior distribution.

- Extensive experiments validate effectiveness of the proposed techniques over six public datasets. The retraining mechanism outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering accuracy under various perturbations.
