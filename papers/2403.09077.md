# [Information Extraction: An application to the domain of hyper-local   financial data on developing countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of financial data on company activities in developing countries to support development research and economic analysis. 
- Existing NLP models for named entity recognition (NER) and information extraction are focused on Western/English data. Performance on non-Western financial text is unknown.

Proposed Solutions:
1) Text-to-text transformer model (T5) for simultaneous NER and relation extraction
2) Sequential pipeline with pre-trained NER, dependency parsing and rule-based relation extraction 

Key Contributions:
- Curated and manually labeled dataset of over 6,000 paragraphs from African financial news for model training and testing
- Evaluated performance of standard NLP techniques on this new dataset 
- Proposed and tested novel text-to-text approach using T5 transformer to achieve 92.44% accuracy with 68.25% precision and 54.20% recall on combined NER and relation extraction task
- Developed custom rules and heuristics for sequential NER and relation extraction baseline, achieving 84.72% accuracy

The authors highlight promising performance of the text-to-text transformer approach on specialized developing country financial text. They aim to continue expanding training data and tuning models to further improve extraction quality. The curated dataset enables benchmarking of NLP techniques on this important and underserved domain.
