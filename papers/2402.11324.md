# [EVEDIT: Event-based Knowledge Editing with Deductive Editing Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11324)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing knowledge editing (KE) methods operate on isolated facts without context, leading to an uncertain editing boundary. This causes related knowledge to remain ambiguous, shrinking the usable knowledge within edited models.  
- The paper analyzes this deficiency by introducing two theoretical concepts - the deduction anchor and editing boundary. It shows that current methods make flawed assumptions about the deduction anchor.
- Specifically, either assigning an empty deduction anchor or too broad of an anchor both fail for counterfactual, non-local edits, causing the remaining knowledge to explode logically. This theoretically increases uncertainty.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes event-based KE where edits are paired with event descriptions to provide context. This implicitly defines better deduction anchors and editing boundaries.
- A new benchmark E^2dit is introduced by transforming the CounterFact dataset into event-based edits using GPT-3.5 prompts. Evaluations involve both QA and text completion.
- A novel self-editing approach is proposed where the model is fine-tuned to incorporate edits by answering event-based questions before generating. 

Main Contributions:  
- Identifies the deduction anchor issue causing uncertainty in edited models
- Proposes more logical event-based KE aligning with real-world use cases 
- Introduces benchmark E^2dit derived from CounterFact
- Proposes self-editing method outperforming prior approaches on E^2dit

The paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions towards addressing ambiguity in editing boundaries, advocating for event-based knowledge editing research.
