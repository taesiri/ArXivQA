# [Leveraging Thermal Modality to Enhance Reconstruction in Low-Light   Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRF) rely on colorimetric radiance information to successfully reconstruct 3D scenes. However, in low-light conditions, images contain noise and insufficient illumination which degrades NeRF performance. 
- Existing methods use post-processed sRGB images as input which removes valuable details and information in dark regions due to lossy camera processing. Using raw images preserves more information but contains significant noise.
- There is a lack of multimodal (visible + thermal) datasets to study the benefits of thermal images on 3D reconstruction in low light.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Thermal-NeRF which takes both raw visible images and thermal images as input for novel view synthesis.
- Thermal images provide geometric supervision to stabilize training. A thermal prediction head is added to constrain geometry optimization.
- Extend image Retinex decomposition to 3D scenes (Retinex3D) by predicting view-dependent reflectance and illumination fields.
- Use a multi-exposure strategy to handle the large intensity range in raw images. Multiple MLP heads predict illumination at different exposures which are recursively composed.

Contributions:  
- Thermal-NeRF shows improved visible view synthesis accuracy over state-of-the-art low-light NeRF methods, with better detail preservation and noise reduction.
- First aligned multi-view visible and thermal dataset containing 20 night scenes to facilitate multimodal NeRF research.  
- Demonstrate mutual benefits of visible and thermal modalities for reconstructing low-light 3D scenes.
- Show method can extend to explicit/hybrid NeRF models for efficient rendering without compromising quality.

In summary, the paper introduces a multimodal framework to address limitations of NeRF in extreme low-light conditions, leveraging benefits of complementary thermal images while preserving raw visible image details.
