# [INSITE: labelling medical images using submodular functions and   semi-supervised data programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical imaging produces large amounts of data, but labeling data for supervised learning is expensive and time-consuming. This limits the applicability of deep learning methods which require large labeled datasets. 

- Semi-supervised learning methods can leverage unlabeled data to improve model performance with less labeled data. But they have limitations in handling noise and variability in medical images.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a semi-supervised learning technique called INSITE that uses informed subset selection to identify a small diverse/representative set of images. These are labeled by experts and used as "exemplars".

- Apply data programming paradigm to create multiple labeling functions using these exemplar images that can assign labels and similarity scores to unlabeled images.

- Aggregate the outputs of labeling functions using CAGE method to assign consensus labels to unlabeled data.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate that data programming using a small set of carefully selected, expert labeled exemplar images can effectively label large unlabeled medical image datasets. 

- Propose using submodular functions for informed subset selection to pick most useful images for experts to label. This gives better performance than random selection.

- Show superior performance over several other semi-supervised learning methods on 3 public medical imaging datasets for binary classification tasks even with very small labeled subset (1%) and under strict budget constraints.

- First work to show that data programming can be effectively applied in medical imaging to mitigate lack of labeled data, using domain expert knowledge to create labeling functions.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative data programming-based semi-supervised approach for medical image analysis that can produce high accuracy even with few expert-labeled exemplars guiding the process.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach called INSITE that selects a small informative subset of medical images to be labeled by experts, uses them as exemplars to create labeling functions within a data programming paradigm, and aggregates their outputs to assign labels to a large pool of unlabeled images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Developing a semi-supervised learning approach called INSITE (labelINg medical imageS usIng submodular funcTions and sEmi-supervised data programming) that can accurately label medical images using only a small set of labeled images. Specifically:

1) They use informed subset selection with submodular functions to identify the most representative or diverse small subset of images from a large unlabeled pool to be labeled by experts. 

2) They then use these expert-labeled images as exemplars to develop labeling functions based on data programming. The labeling functions output a predicted label and similarity score for unlabeled images.

3) They aggregate the outputs of the labeling functions using a generative model called CAGE to assign consensus labels to the unlabeled images.

4) They demonstrate that this approach outperforms other semi-supervised methods, especially when only a very small budget is available for getting expert annotations. So it is promising for resource-constrained medical imaging scenarios.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a semi-supervised approach that can accurately label medical images by combining informed subset selection, data programming using exemplars, and label aggregation. The key advantage is high accuracy even with few expert-labeled exemplars.

The paper proposes an approach called INSITE for labeling medical images by using submodular functions for informed subset selection to identify a small diverse set of images to be manually labeled. These are then used as exemplars with data programming methods like labeling functions and the CAGE algorithm for label aggregation to assign labels to the remaining unlabeled images. The approach is evaluated on medical imaging datasets like diabetic retinopathy, chest x-rays and tuberculosis x-rays. The key terms reflect this overall methodology and domain application.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using submodular functions for subset selection of images to be labeled by experts. What properties do submodular functions have that make them suitable for diverse subset selection? How is the facility location function used for representative subset selection while the log determinant function captures diversity?

2. The paper mentions using pre-trained ResNet for feature extraction of the images. Why is transfer learning via ResNet features preferred over raw images? What aspects of the images are captured by ResNet features that are relevant for the subset selection and labeling functions?

3. Explain the core idea behind data programming for weak supervision using labeling functions. How do the labeling functions output both a predicted label and a similarity score? What heuristic, rule or domain knowledge goes into designing the labeling functions?

4. How does the CAGE method work for aggregating the outputs of multiple labeling functions? What is the generative model and what are the parameters learned during CAGE training? How does CAGE deal with conflicting labels from different labeling functions?

5. Why is informed subset selection combined with data programming able to outperform other semi-supervised methods, especially with low annotation budgets? What inductive biases allow the model to generalize even with few labeled examples?

6. The performance of data programming methods tends to degrade at higher annotation budgets while neural network methods improve. What factors contribute to this trend? How can the robustness of data programming be improved?

7. How suitable is the proposed approach for multi-class classification problems? What changes would be needed in CAGE or the labeling functions to handle multi-class datasets? 

8. What other semi-supervised learning methods could the subset selection strategy be combined with? Why were the specific baselines compared against chosen in the paper?

9. The dataset used comprises imbalanced classes. How robust is the method against class imbalance? Should special handling be done during subset selection or labeling functions creation?

10. For practical adoption, how much effort needs to go into designing good labeling functions? What guidelines can help construct simple but effective labeling functions based on domain knowledge?
