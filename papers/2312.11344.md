# [Muted: Multilingual Targeted Offensive Speech Identification and   Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offensive language such as hate, abuse, and profanity (HAP) is prevalent online and can be hurtful to readers. 
- Prior work has focused on classifying text at a sentence level as offensive or not, with limited work on identifying specific offensive spans and targets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Muted, a system to identify and visualize offensive arguments and their targets in multilingual text using heatmaps.  
- Muted can work with any transformer-based HAP classification model, using the model's attention mechanism to highlight offensive spans without further fine-tuning.
- It identifies the target and argument in the highlighted spans using spaCy's dependency parser.

Main Contributions:
- Presents a way to visualize offensive spans and targets for any language, given an existing sentence-level HAP classifier.
- Introduces the Piccolo-HAP multilingual classifier which outperforms models like HateBERT on identifying spans.
- Evaluates the approach on English (TBO dataset) and a newly annotated German offensive tweets dataset.
- Provides Jupyter notebooks and a UI to run models to produce visualizations showing targets/arguments.
- Analysis shows the approach efficiently processes 100 sentences in around 1 minute on CPU and GPU.

In summary, the key innovation is an attention-based technique to interpret black-box HAP models to identify and visualize multilingual offensive spans and targets, available via an easy-to-use interface. The results demonstrate improved performance over existing baselines in evaluating the approach.
