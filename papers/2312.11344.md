# [Muted: Multilingual Targeted Offensive Speech Identification and   Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offensive language such as hate, abuse, and profanity (HAP) is prevalent online and can be hurtful to readers. 
- Prior work has focused on classifying text at a sentence level as offensive or not, with limited work on identifying specific offensive spans and targets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Muted, a system to identify and visualize offensive arguments and their targets in multilingual text using heatmaps.  
- Muted can work with any transformer-based HAP classification model, using the model's attention mechanism to highlight offensive spans without further fine-tuning.
- It identifies the target and argument in the highlighted spans using spaCy's dependency parser.

Main Contributions:
- Presents a way to visualize offensive spans and targets for any language, given an existing sentence-level HAP classifier.
- Introduces the Piccolo-HAP multilingual classifier which outperforms models like HateBERT on identifying spans.
- Evaluates the approach on English (TBO dataset) and a newly annotated German offensive tweets dataset.
- Provides Jupyter notebooks and a UI to run models to produce visualizations showing targets/arguments.
- Analysis shows the approach efficiently processes 100 sentences in around 1 minute on CPU and GPU.

In summary, the key innovation is an attention-based technique to interpret black-box HAP models to identify and visualize multilingual offensive spans and targets, available via an easy-to-use interface. The results demonstrate improved performance over existing baselines in evaluating the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Muted, a system to identify and visualize multilingual hate, abuse, and profanity content by displaying offensive arguments and their targets using heat maps to indicate intensity, without needing to fine-tune the underlying transformer model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting Muted, a system for visually identifying and demonstrating offensive arguments and their targets in a multilingual setting. Muted stands for MUltilingual Targted Demonstration.

2. The system can leverage any transformer-based hate/abuse/profanity (HAP) classification model and its attention mechanism out-of-the-box to identify toxic spans, without needing further fine-tuning. 

3. The system identifies the specific targets and arguments of the offensive spans using spaCy's dependency parser.

4. The paper demonstrates the system's performance on existing English and German offensive speech datasets, and also presents new German annotations.

5. The paper provides easy-to-use Python notebooks and a front-end UI to run the visualization approach on any encoder-only HAP classifier.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting Muted, a multilingual system for visually identifying and demonstrating offensive arguments and their targets using attention heatmaps and dependency parsing, which can work with any existing transformer HAP classifier without needing further fine-tuning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Offensive language detection
- Hate speech, abuse, profanity (HAP)
- Multilingual targeted offensive speech 
- Attention heatmaps
- Visualization of offensive spans and targets
- Argument and target of offense
- Transformer models
- Piccolo-HAP classifier
- Target Based Offensive Language (TBO) dataset
- Toxic Spans Detection (TSD) dataset 
- SpaCy visualization
- Jupyter notebooks
- User interface

The paper introduces Muted, a system to identify and visualize multilingual offensive content and its targets using attention heatmaps from transformer models. It leverages the Piccolo-HAP classifier and evaluates on the TBO and TSD datasets. The key focus is on visualizing the offensive argument and its target, providing Jupyter notebooks and a UI to demonstrate the approach. So the main keywords relate to offensive language detection, visualization, argument/target identification, and the models and datasets used.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using attention heatmaps from existing hate/abuse/profanity (HAP) classifiers to identify offensive spans and targets. How exactly is the attention heatmap generated from the transformer model? What role does the CLS token play?

2. The paper evaluates the approach on the Target Based Offensive Language (TBO) dataset. What are the different evaluation settings used with this dataset (Target + Arg, Arg Only, Target Only)? Why is the Target Only setting considered a fairer evaluation? 

3. The paper finds that their approach works very well when the targets themselves are described using offensive/derogatory terms. Why might this be the case? Can you think of ways to improve performance when targets do not contain offensive language?

4. For sentences where there is a null target annotated, the model may still predict a target span. What could be done during data annotation or model training to better handle these cases? 

5. The paper compares several baseline models like HateBERT and the Multilingual Toxicity Classifier Plus (MTC+). How do these baseline models work and what are their limitations compared to the proposed approach?

6. The paper demonstrates the approach on English and German text. What would need to be done to support more languages like Spanish? What existing resources could be leveraged?

7. The paper uses the spaCy library to extract the target and argument after identifying offensive spans. Why is spaCy used instead of just highlighting the full predicted spans? What information does spaCy provide?

8. One limitation mentioned is that the test sets used are relatively small and consist of short text spans like tweets. How could the approach be adapted and evaluated for longer text passages? Would any changes be needed?

9. The paper focuses only on identifying and visualizing offensive content. How could this approach be extended to also classify offensiveness or harmfulness of the detected spans?

10. The paper proposes use cases like hiding/warning about offensive terms and avoiding generating hate in large language models. Can you think of other real-world applications that could benefit from detecting targeted offensive spans?
