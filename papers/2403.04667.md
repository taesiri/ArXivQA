## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a protocol proposed in another source. Could you expand on what specific steps were involved in that protocol and why those were chosen as a basis for this literature review? 

2. When formulating the research questions, what key factors did you consider in determining the focus and scope? How did you decide on the specific aspects to explore in RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3?

3. In executing the search strategy, what challenges did you face in trying to identify relevant literature on this emerging topic? How did you adapt the strategy to account for the rapidly evolving discourse on ChatGPT?  

4. What were some of the main criteria you used when assessing the eligibility of sources for inclusion? Were there any sources you debated including or not including - what were the deciding factors?

5. When extracting and organizing relevant data from the selected sources, did you encounter any limitations in the available data for answering certain aspects of the research questions? How did you approach synthesizing the data to derive meaningful insights? 

6. The codes used for analysis seem to provide a comprehensive framework - how exactly were these developed? Did any additional codes emerge during the analysis that may be relevant to include?  

7. In the results, you use visual tools like treemaps and Sankey diagrams - what value do you think these visualizations add versus just presenting statistics on code frequencies? How do they aid in data interpretation?

8. You chose to include both grey literature and academic papers - what do you see as the relative benefits and limitations of these two types of sources in exploring this research topic? 

9. The study highlights several areas requiring improvement - if you were to prioritize just 3 top areas to address in the near term, which would those be and why? 

10. If you were to expand this study in the future, what additional research questions or aspects would you seek to explore around the social impact of generative AI? Why are those particular directions promising?
