# [Towards Realistic Landmark-Guided Facial Video Inpainting Based on GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09100)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Facial video inpainting is challenging due to the complexity of facial features and human familiarity with faces. 
- Existing works focus on object/scene inpainting and moving occlusions, not facial videos. There is a gap for handling both static and dynamic occlusions in facial videos.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes an expression-based video inpainting network using GANs to handle static and moving masks in facial videos.  
- It builds on the Learnable Gated Temporal Shift Module (LGTSM) by adding an attention mechanism and facial landmarks+reference image as input.

Key Contributions:
- Handles both static and moving masks in facial video inpainting. Most works focus on one or the other.
- Preserves identity consistently across frames using facial landmarks and occlusion-free reference image.
- Enhances emotion preservation through custom facial expression recognition (FER) loss.
- Achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on FaceForensics dataset and high-quality visually coherent completions. 
- Adaptive framework applicable for occlusion removal in video conferencing, medical imaging, expression analysis, etc.

Future Work:
- Higher resolution 2D video inpainting preserving intricate facial details
- 3D volumetric video inpainting for immersive XR experiences

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative GAN architecture for facial video inpainting that can handle both static and moving masks while preserving identity and facial expressions very effectively.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a facial video inpainting method using GANs that handles both static and moving masks by utilizing facial landmarks and an occlusion-free reference image to maintain identity and expression consistency across frames.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new framework for facial video inpainting that can handle both static and moving occlusions (masks) in video frames. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a GAN-based network designed for expression-based video inpainting that can inpaint facial regions covered by masks, ensuring spatial and temporal coherence. 

- The model utilizes facial landmarks and an occlusion-free reference image to maintain the identity of the person in the video consistently across frames.

- It incorporates a customized facial expression recognition (FER) loss function to ensure the inpainted outputs preserve the facial expressions and emotions accurately.

- The framework is adaptive and can handle masks that are either static or moving across frames in the facial video. This allows it to address real-world situations with different types of occlusions.

- Comparative experiments demonstrate the model's superior performance over existing methods in inpainting static and dynamic masks, in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

In summary, the main contribution is an adaptive facial video inpainting framework uniquely designed to handle both static and moving masks by leveraging landmarks, reference images, and facial expression preservation.
