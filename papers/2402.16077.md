# [Equivariant Frames and the Impossibility of Continuous Canonicalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Group equivariance is important in machine learning to incorporate known data symmetries, but custom equivariant architectures can be difficult to design and compute. Frame-averaging is a more flexible alternative, but recent works have found an empirical benefit to using probabilistic frames instead. 

- This paper shows there is a fundamental issue with standard (unweighted) frame-averaging: for commonly used groups, there exists no choice of frame that preserves continuity while remaining efficiently computable. In other words, unweighted frame averaging can turn a smooth function into a discontinuous function, hurting model robustness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper generalizes the notion of frames to "weighted frames" where group elements have non-uniform, input-dependent weights. This is analogous to recent successful methods using probabilistic frames.

- Weak equivariance and continuity are formally defined for weighted frames. Frames satisfying both are dubbed "\cCWW frames". 

- It is shown that the invariant projection operators induced by \cCWW frames always preserve continuity, unlike unweighted frames.

Main Contributions:
- Problems with existence of continuous canonicalization and frames are established for permutation groups and rotation groups.

- Weighted frames and associated notions of weak equivariance and continuity are introduced and theoretically justified.

- Explicit constructions of efficient, continuous \cCWW frames are provided for permutations, $SO(2)$, and $SO(3)$, with accompanying size/complexity analysis.

- The results support recent empirical success of probabilistic frames, and provide guidance for developing robust and efficient equivariant learning methods using frame-averaging.
