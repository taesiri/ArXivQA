# [Neural Parameter Allocation Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10598)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research hypothesis of this paper is that generalized parameter sharing techniques can be automatically learned to effectively implement neural network architectures within arbitrary parameter budgets, without requiring any changes to the architecture or loss function. The authors propose Neural Parameter Allocation Search (NPAS) as a novel task to optimize how parameters are assigned and generated for layers in a network given a fixed budget. To address NPAS, they introduce Shapeshifter Networks (SSNs) which learn mappings of layers to parameter groups and methods to generate weights from a limited budget. The key ideas are:- Parameter sharing can be automated and generalized beyond identical layers through learned mappings and weight generation.- SSNs enable training with limited parameters (to reduce memory) as well as excess parameters (to boost capacity), and work for any architecture.- Automatically learning where to share parameters avoids relying on hand-crafted heuristics that have limited flexibility. - SSNs demonstrate improved performance over prior specialized parameter sharing methods, especially when using very constrained budgets.- SSNs can also be combined with other techniques like pruning and distillation for further gains.In summary, the central hypothesis is that generalized parameter sharing can be automated to train networks within any budget without changing the architecture, and SSNs are proposed as an effective approach to accomplish this. Evaluating SSNs across diverse tasks and budgets is intended to demonstrate the viability of this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces Neural Parameter Allocation Search (NPAS), a novel task where the goal is to train a neural network with a fixed parameter budget. The authors propose Shapeshifter Networks (SSNs) to address NPAS by automatically learning where and how to share parameters in a network. The main contributions are:- Proposing NPAS, a new task that generalizes prior work on parameter sharing to support arbitrary parameter budgets and network architectures. This enables exploring new regimes like low-budget to reduce memory and high-budget to improve accuracy.- Introducing SSNs which can morph a fixed set of parameters into the desired weights for any network architecture. SSNs have three main components: 1) Automatically mapping layers to parameter groups where sharing is effective.2) Generating weights from the associated parameters using downsampling when there are excess parameters or upsampling when there are insufficient parameters. 3) Learning these mappings and generation functions in a way that works for any network architecture.- Demonstrating SSNs effectively implement NPAS on a variety of tasks and models, creating compact models in low-budget regimes and improving accuracy in high-budget regimes.- Showing SSNs can be combined with other techniques like pruning and distillation for further gains.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and providing a solution (SSNs) for a new problem (NPAS) that generalizes prior work on parameter sharing to arbitrary budgets and architectures. The benefits are shown across diverse tasks and models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces Neural Parameter Allocation Search (NPAS), a novel task of training neural networks with arbitrary fixed parameter budgets, and proposes Shapeshifter Networks (SSNs) which automatically learn how to share parameters across layers to effectively solve NPAS.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new task called Neural Parameter Allocation Search (NPAS) for optimally distributing a fixed parameter budget across the layers of a neural network architecture. The key novelties are:- NPAS generalizes prior work on cross-layer parameter sharing, which relied on hand-crafted heuristics and could only share parameters between identical layers. NPAS has no architectural constraints and can automatically learn where to best allocate parameters.- NPAS operates in two novel regimes - low-budget, which creates compact models like prior work; and high-budget, which boosts capacity and performance without changing model architecture. - The proposed Shapeshifter Networks (SSNs) are the first method that can automatically learn where and how to share parameters between layers of different sizes/types. Prior methods like Shared WideResNets relied on manual heuristics.- SSNs can implement models using any parameter budget through a combination of parameter downsampling and a new upsampling method. No prior work could adapt to budgets where layers need more parameters than available.So in summary, this paper significantly advances research on cross-layer parameter sharing by making it fully automated, task-agnostic, and applicable to any parameter budget. The low-budget regime reduces memory/communication costs like prior work, while the high-budget regime is entirely novel. The experiments comprehensively demonstrate these advantages over prior art on both vision and language tasks using CNNs and Transformers.The key limitations compared to other research is that NPAS does not aim to reduce computational costs like pruning or quantization methods. But the paper shows it can be combined with these orthogonal techniques for further benefits. Overall, this is an important advancement for efficient deep learning that makes parameter sharing more generally applicable.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some key future research directions suggested in the paper:- Develop more efficient and powerful methods for parameter upsampling, especially for fully-connected layers. The paper notes their simple learned masking approach works well for convolutional layers which have clear spatial structure, but more investigation is needed for fully-connected layers.- Explore more ways to automatically learn parameter group mappings rather than relying on clustering layer representations from a small pretrained model. The pretraining step adds some overhead, so more efficient approaches would be useful.- Study whether the benefits of SSNs in the high-budget regime are related to increased model depth, since SSNs spread parameters across more layers. Connections to benefits of network depth could provide useful insights.- Combine SSNs with other techniques like architecture search or self-assembling networks to enable training larger, deeper models under a parameter budget constraint. SSNs provide flexibility these methods currently lack.- Optimize training strategies for SSNs and NPAS methods to further improve convergence speed, since parameter sharing can benefit optimization.- Explore privacy and security implications of SSNs' ability to capture large models with fewer parameters. This could enable deploying potentially harmful applications more easily.- Evaluate SSNs on a broader range of tasks and model architectures. The paper studies mainly vision and vision-language tasks.- Analyze in more detail the optimization landscape induced by SSNs and whether their inductive biases relate to empirical benefits. This could provide better understanding.In summary, suggestions include improving parameter upsampling, finding more efficient grouping techniques, connecting SSN benefits to model depth, combining with architecture search methods, faster training, studying security issues, and more extensive evaluation and analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Neural Parameter Allocation Search (NPAS), a new task where the goal is to train a neural network architecture using an arbitrary, fixed parameter budget. NPAS generalizes prior work on parameter sharing by supporting both low-budget regimes that reduce memory/communication costs and high-budget regimes that add capacity to improve performance without changing FLOPs. To address NPAS, the authors introduce Shapeshifter Networks (SSNs) which automate parameter sharing. SSNs learn a mapping of layers to parameter groups in a short pretraining step. Weights are then generated for each layer by morphing the parameters in its group using learned downsampling or upsampling. Experiments on vision, vision-language, and QA tasks demonstrate SSNs enable training with fewer parameters than prior sharing approaches. Surprisingly, SSNs can effectively share parameters between very different layers like convolutional and recurrent networks. Further, SSNs combine well with distillation and pruning for additional gains.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Neural Parameter Allocation Search (NPAS), a novel task where the goal is to train a neural network using an arbitrary, fixed parameter budget. NPAS generalizes prior work on parameter sharing, supporting both low-budget regimes that reduce memory requirements as well as novel high-budget regimes that add capacity to improve performance without changing the architecture. To address NPAS, the authors introduce Shapeshifter Networks (SSNs) which automatically learn where and how to share parameters in a network using a short pretraining step to determine effective parameter sharing. SSNs generate weights for each layer by downsampling available parameters when there are excess parameters, or upsampling parameters when there are insufficient parameters. Experiments demonstrate SSNs effectively implement networks using few parameters, outperforming prior sharing approaches, as well as benefiting from additional capacity when using excess parameters. Further, SSNs are shown to combine favorably with knowledge distillation and pruning.In summary, this paper formalizes the novel NPAS task of training neural networks with arbitrary parameter budgets. The proposed SSN framework leverages automated parameter sharing strategies to effectively optimize networks in low-budget and high-budget regimes. Experiments demonstrate benefits on diverse tasks using vision, language, and vision-language models. SSNs provide a general, automated approach for parameter sharing that can also integrate with other techniques like distillation and pruning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes Shapeshifter Networks (SSNs), a framework for addressing the Neural Parameter Allocation Search (NPAS) task through generalized parameter sharing. SSNs learn to morph a fixed budget of parameters into the weights used by a neural network. They first learn in a short pretraining step where parameter sharing is most effective, which is used to select the trainable parameters for generating layer weights. If there are more trainable parameters than layer weights, they form templates and learn a weighted linear combination to generate the layer weights. If there are fewer trainable parameters, they provide an efficient upsampling method. The weights for each layer are generated on-demand without changing the model architecture or loss function. Overall, SSNs automatically learn an efficient parameter sharing strategy to implement a network within an arbitrary, fixed parameter budget.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of high memory requirements for training neural networks. Specifically, the large number of parameters in modern neural network architectures places demands on GPU memory and communication costs in distributed training. The key question the paper seeks to address is how to reduce these memory and communication costs while maintaining model accuracy. The paper proposes a new task called Neural Parameter Allocation Search (NPAS) to address this issue. The goal in NPAS is to train a neural network using an arbitrary, fixed parameter budget. This involves identifying how to assign a subset of parameters to each layer in the network and generating layer weights from the assigned parameters. NPAS allows model compression by reducing the parameter budget (low-budget NPAS) or adding capacity by increasing the budget (high-budget NPAS).To solve NPAS, the paper introduces Shapeshifter Networks (SSNs) which learn how to share parameters across layers in order to fit any parameter budget. SSNs automatically determine where sharing is most effective and generate weights by downsampling or upsampling parameters as needed. This allows SSNs to reduce memory and communication costs while maintaining accuracy.In summary, the key problem is reducing memory and communication requirements in neural network training, and the paper introduces NPAS and SSNs to learn compact, accurate models for arbitrary parameter budgets.
