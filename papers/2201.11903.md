# [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How does generating a "chain of thought" - a series of intermediate reasoning steps - impact the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning tasks?

In particular, the paper explores using a simple method called "chain-of-thought prompting" to elicit reasoning abilities in large language models. In this method, the model is prompted with a few examples that demonstrate a chain of thought leading to the final answer. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that sufficiently large language models can generate logical chains of thought if provided with these kinds of demonstrations in the prompt. The paper then provides empirical evidence to evaluate this hypothesis across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

In summary, the central research question is whether chain-of-thought prompting can unlock reasoning abilities in large language models, which is assessed through experiments on a diverse set of reasoning tasks. The key hypothesis is that this method can elicit reasoning in sufficiently large models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating a method called "chain-of-thought prompting" to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models. Specifically:

- The key idea is to augment few-shot prompting exemplars with a "chain of thought" - a series of intermediate reasoning steps leading to the final answer. This is inspired by how humans break down complex reasoning tasks into multiple steps. 

- The paper shows that prompting large language models (specifically LaMDA, GPT-3, PaLM) with these chain-of-thought examples significantly improves performance on a diverse set of reasoning tasks: arithmetic (math word problems), commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning.

- The gains are especially large for more complex, multi-step reasoning problems where standard prompting has flat scaling curves. For instance, on the GSM8K math word problem benchmark, chain-of-thought prompting helps the 540B parameter PaLM model achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even finetuned models.

- The approach appears quite general, requiring only a few examples of reasoning chains rather than task-specific training. The paper also analyzes the types of errors, showing many could be fixed by improving arithmetic or semantic understanding abilities.

In summary, the main contribution is showing how chain-of-thought prompting can unlock latent reasoning abilities in large language models, enabling significant gains on challenging reasoning tasks with minimal intervention. The simple prompting approach could be widely applicable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on skimming through the paper, a one sentence summary could be: 

The paper explores how prompting large language models to generate a chain of thought, which is a series of intermediate reasoning steps, can significantly improve their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks involving arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The main contribution of this paper is introducing the idea of using chain of thought prompting to elicit reasoning and multi-step inference in large language models. This approach of augmenting few-shot prompts with intermediate reasoning steps is novel compared to prior work on prompting and explanations.

- Most prior work on improving reasoning abilities in language models involves specialized model architectures, training objectives, or annotations/datasets to enable reasoning. This work shows how reasoning can emerge in standard, unmodified large language models via prompting alone.

- This work shows strong empirical results on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The performance from chain of thought prompting is competitive and sometimes exceeds prior specialized methods on certain benchmarks.

- For arithmetic reasoning, this work compares favorably to prior methods like Neuro-Symbolic approaches and rationale-augmented training/finetuning. The key difference is that chain of thought prompting elicits reasoning without model finetuning.

- For commonsense reasoning, chain of thought prompting achieves strong results compared to prior specialized models and training methods designed for commonsense reasoning. This highlights the broad applicability of chain of thought prompting.

- Overall, this work provides evidence that chain of thought prompting is an effective and general way to unlock latent reasoning skills in large language models. The gains are achieved with just a simple prompting modification and without any model training. This contrasts with most prior work requiring specialized architectures or training procedures for reasoning.

In summary, the novelty of eliciting reasoning via chain of thought prompting, the strong empirical results, and the simplicity of the approach differentiate this work from prior research focused on improving reasoning in language models. The findings suggest prompting may allow more performant and general reasoning than previously thought.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Exploring how much more reasoning ability can be improved with further increases in model scale. The paper shows that chain-of-thought reasoning emerges at around 100 billion parameters, but it is unclear how much more performance could be gained by scaling up even further.

- Investigating other prompting methods that could expand the range of tasks large language models can solve. Chain-of-thought prompting shows promise but may not be the only approach to unlocking reasoning abilities.

- Improving the factual correctness of model-generated chains of thought. The paper notes there are no guarantees the reasoning paths are fully coherent or accurate. Methods to improve faithfulness could also boost reasoning performance.

- Developing techniques to induce reasoning skills in smaller models. The emergence of reasoning is tied to large model scale, which makes deployment expensive. Finding ways to confer reasoning abilities to smaller models would be useful.

- Exploring the application of chain-of-thought prompting to a wider range of tasks like machine translation. The paper focuses on math and commonsense reasoning but the approach could plausibly help with other text-to-text tasks.

- Automatically generating chains of thought via prompting instead of manual annotation. This could make chain-of-thought prompting more scalable while retaining the benefits.

- Analyzing the causal factors in model training that enable chain-of-thought reasoning to emerge. The reasoning abilities likely arise from properties of the model architecture, optimization, and pretraining data.

In summary, the key future directions center on improving reasoning abilities further, applying chain-of-thought prompting more broadly, making the approach more scalable, and analyzing the root factors that unlock reasoning in large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores how generating a chain of thought - a series of intermediate reasoning steps - significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. The authors show that by providing just a few examples of chains of thought as part of the prompt, large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM can solve challenging tasks in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning that they struggle with using standard prompting. The chain of thought allows the model to break down multi-step problems into intermediate natural language steps resembling human thought processes. Experiments demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting substantially boosts performance across several reasoning benchmarks compared to standard prompting, especially for the largest models like GPT-3 175B and PaLM 540B. The gains are shown to be robust across different annotators, prompts, and models. Overall, the work underscores how prompting with demonstrations of reasoning steps allows language models to decompose and tackle complex reasoning problems, unlocking abilities not seen with standard prompting.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores how generating a chain of thought - a series of intermediate reasoning steps - can significantly improve the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning tasks. The authors show that by providing just a few demonstrations of chains of thought in a prompt, large language models can generate their own chains of thought to decompose multi-step problems when answering questions. 

The authors evaluate chain-of-thought prompting on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks using several large language models including LaMDA, GPT-3, and PaLM. They find that chain-of-thought prompting substantially improves performance over standard prompting, especially on more complicated, multi-step problems. The gains are shown to be robust across different annotators, exemplars, and models. Overall, the work underscores how prompting large language models with exemplary chains of thought allows them to solve challenging problems that require decomposition and reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper explores how generating a chain of thought - a series of intermediate reasoning steps - can improve the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning tasks. The key method is called chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is prompted with a few input-output pairs that include a chain of thought leading to the final output. For example, for a math word problem, the prompt would show an input question, followed by the step-by-step reasoning, and finally the output answer. This allows the model to decompose multi-step problems into intermediate natural language steps. The authors show that large language models of sufficient scale (100B+ parameters) are able to generate coherent chains of thought when prompted in this way, even without any task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting substantially improves performance on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks compared to standard prompting. A key finding is that chain-of-thought reasoning emerges as a natural skill in large language models when prompted appropriately.

2. How to elicit reasoning abilities in large language models without requiring a large training dataset or model finetuning. The paper aims to unlock reasoning abilities via a simple prompting method rather than full training or finetuning.

3. Whether generating a "chain of thought" - a series of intermediate reasoning steps - can significantly improve the reasoning abilities of large language models across tasks like arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. The paper explores the utility of chain of thought prompting.

4. Whether chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale, arising naturally only when this prompting approach is used with models over a certain size. The paper investigates the relationship between model scale and chain-of-thought reasoning.

5. How sensitive chain-of-thought prompting is to factors like the specific prompts used and whether the approach can elicit reasoning chains robustly. The paper analyzes the robustness of the method.

In summary, the key focus seems to be on using chain-of-thought prompting to unlock complex reasoning abilities in large language models, without full training or task-specific finetuning. The paper aims to understand when and how well this approach works across different reasoning tasks and model sizes.

The paper explores how generating a chain of thought—a series of intermediate reasoning steps—can improve the reasoning abilities of large language models. The method, called chain-of-thought prompting, involves providing a few examples that demonstrate step-by-step reasoning in the prompt. Experiments on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks show that chain-of-thought prompting substantially improves performance compared to standard prompting, especially for more complex multi-step problems.

The paper explores how generating a chain of thought - a series of intermediate reasoning steps - can significantly improve the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning tasks. The authors propose a simple method called chain-of-thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as examples when prompting the model. Experiments on three large language models (LaMDA, PaLM, GPT-3) on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks show that chain-of-thought prompting substantially improves performance compared to standard prompting.
