# [FlaKat: A Machine Learning-Based Categorization Framework for Flaky   Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01003)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Flaky tests are test cases that can pass or fail non-deterministically without changes to the software under test. They reduce the reliability and efficiency of test suites. Although solutions exist for detecting flaky tests, there is a lack of frameworks for accurately categorizing known flaky tests to reflect their root causes, which can aid developers in understanding and fixing them.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FlaKat, a novel framework that leverages machine learning for fast and accurate prediction of flaky test categories. FlaKat takes as input the source code of known flaky Java test cases. It vectorizes the code using doc2vec, code2vec or TF-IDF into high-dimensional embeddings. It then reduces the dimensionality with techniques like LDA to enable visualization and clustering. Finally, classifiers like SVM, KNN and Random Forest are trained on the embeddings to predict flaky test categories. Sampling techniques address class imbalance.

Main Contributions:
- FlaKat framework with a 4-phase workflow for flaky test categorization using machine learning on source code embeddings 
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis of multiple dimension reduction techniques applied on various embeddings  
- Introduction of Flakiness Detection Capacity (FDC), a new evaluation metric inspired by information theory, that is shown to be more consistent and discriminant than F1 score
- Comprehensive evaluation on real-world flaky tests from IDoFT dataset showing LDA reduction and TF-IDF embedding with Random Forest classifier achieves best performance

The paper provides valuable insights into representing and predicting flaky test categories accurately. FlaKat enables developers to gain more contextual information to efficiently understand and repair flaky tests.
