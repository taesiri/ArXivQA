# [An AI for Scientific Discovery Route between Amorphous Networks and   Mechanical Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03404)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper demonstrates an "AI for science" framework using the relationship between extreme Poisson's ratio values and amorphous network structure as a case study. Initially, a simulated annealing algorithm is used to tune the Poisson's ratio of various amorphous networks across the theoretical limits of -1 to 1. Remarkably, auxetic networks produced by the algorithm are structurally very similar to positive Poisson's ratio networks, contrasting with classical auxetic designs. Experiments confirm the designed auxetic behavior using 3D printed networks. Further analysis reveals the Poisson's ratio originates from the low-frequency vibrational normal modes of the dynamical matrix. By training a convolutional neural network on the dynamical matrix instead of images, the model can predict the Poisson's ratio with higher efficiency. This showcases how machine learning can help reveal physical mechanisms, which in turn improves the machine learning algorithms. Overall, this work provides an excellent demonstrative example of using AI to assist scientific discovery and leveraging the discovered physics to enhance deep learning innovation.
