# [Stochastic Approximation with Delayed Updates: Finite-Time Rates under   Markovian Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms with delayed updates under Markovian sampling. SA algorithms aim to find the root/fixed point of some operator using noisy observations. Examples include TD learning, Q-learning and stochastic gradient descent. The paper considers the challenging setting where (i) the observations come from an underlying Markov process (hence are temporally correlated), and (ii) the updates use stale gradients/observations, i.e., are delayed. The interplay between delays and Markovian correlations is not well understood and analyzing the convergence rate of SA methods in this setting is an open problem.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. The paper first considers constant delays and provides a finite-time analysis showing that the last iterate of SA converges exponentially fast to a ball around the fixed point. The convergence rate scales with the maximum of the delay and the mixing time of the Markov process. 

2. A novel proof technique based on uniform boundedness of iterates is introduced to handle time-varying bounded delays. A tight convergence rate is derived that scales with the maximum delay. An interesting finding is that slowly mixing Markov chains are more robust to delays.

3. A delay-adaptive SA method is proposed and analyzed. This method only updates when the delay falls below a threshold. A key benefit is that the rate now scales with the average delay and does not require knowing the maximum delay for tuning the step size.

4. The results apply broadly to optimization and RL methods including TD learning, Q-learning and stochastic gradient descent under Markovian sampling. Tight problem-dependent constants are provided. The proof techniques are novel and combine ideas from optimization and RL in a non-trivial manner.

In summary, this is the first finite-time analysis of SA schemes under the joint effect of delays and Markovian sampling. The tight analysis introduces new proof ideas that depart from existing literature. The delay-adaptive scheme also provides added robustness. The findings have implications for large-scale asynchronous reinforcement learning systems.
