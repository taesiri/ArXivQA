# [Towards a Comprehensive, Efficient and Promptable Anatomic Structure   Segmentation Model using 3D Whole-body CT Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15063)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows promising generalization ability for natural image segmentation. However, directly applying SAM to medical images results in significant performance drops with inferior accuracy and unstable segmentation. SAM may also require excessive prompt points to obtain reasonable accuracy. For 3D volumetric scans like CT/MRI, handling hundreds of 2D slices with a 2D SAM model is inefficient. Recent works explore adapting SAM to medical volumes but are limited to segmenting only specific organs/tumors.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes CT-SAM3D, a comprehensive, efficient and promptable 3D segmentation model for whole-body CT scans. Instead of adapting SAM, the authors train a 3D promptable segmentation model from scratch using a curated dataset of 1204 fully labeled CT scans containing 107 anatomy labels. To effectively train CT-SAM3D, two key techniques are introduced:

1) Progressively and Spatially Aligned Prompt (PSAP): Encodes user click prompts into separate positive and negative click maps instead of learning an additional embedding. Applies modulated normalization to decoder features based on downsampled click maps for accurate spatial alignment.

2) Cross-Patch Prompt (CPP): Captures larger spatial context to reduce workload when prompting large organs. Predicts prompts for a patch based on the segmentation of its overlapping neighbor patches.

Main Contributions:

- Presents CT-SAM3D, a 3D promptable segmentation model that segments 107 anatomy categories in CT scans with superior efficiency and accuracy over previous SAM-derived models.

- Enhances TotalSeg dataset by adding muscle, fat labels, increasing labeled voxel ratio to 83%. 

- Proposes PSAP to accurately respond to prompts in 3D space. CPP reduces workload for large organs.

- Achieves new SOTAs on multiple datasets, generalizes to unseen organs. Interactive tool provides quasi-real-time experience.

In summary, the paper develops an effective and efficient 3D interactive segmentation model for whole-body CT scans with innovative prompt encoding and cross-patch prompt techniques. The model and tool have significance for various clinical applications.
