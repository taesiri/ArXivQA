# [AutoDiffusion: Training-Free Optimization of Time Steps and   Architectures for Automated Diffusion Model Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10438)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we optimize the time steps and architectures of diffusion models in a training-free manner to improve sample quality and accelerate the sampling process? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) There exists an optimal sequence of time steps and corresponding model architecture for each diffusion model that can generalize across datasets. Uniformly reducing time steps is suboptimal.

2) The optimal time steps and model architectures can be found by constructing a unified search space and using an evolutionary algorithm with FID as the performance metric, without needing additional training.

3) The discovered optimal time steps and architectures can effectively improve sample quality, accelerate sampling speed, and complement advanced samplers.

So in summary, the main research question is how to optimize time steps and architectures for diffusion models in a training-free way. The key hypotheses are that optimal configurations exist, can be found through evolutionary search, and can improve diffusion model sampling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a framework called AutoDiffusion to optimize the time steps and architectures of pre-trained diffusion models in a unified manner without any additional training. 

2. Designing a search space that encompasses both the time steps and architectures of the noise prediction network. An evolutionary algorithm is used to effectively search this space.

3. Demonstrating through experiments that the optimal time step sequence found by AutoDiffusion leads to significantly better image quality compared to uniform time steps, especially when using very few steps.

4. Showing that the optimized time steps found for one diffusion model can be applied to another model with the same guidance scale without repeating the search. 

5. Illustrating that AutoDiffusion is orthogonal to and can be combined with advanced diffusion sampling techniques like DDIM, PLMS, etc. to further improve sample quality.

6. Highlighting the efficiency of the proposed method compared to alternatives like progressive distillation and differentiable sampler search which require expensive retraining.

In summary, the key novelty is a training-free framework to automatically search for optimal time steps and architectures to accelerate diffusion models, in contrast to prior work that mainly focused on uniform time step reduction. The searched configurations generalize across models and can complement advanced samplers.
