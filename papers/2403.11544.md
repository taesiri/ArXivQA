# [RL en Markov Games with Independent Function Approximation: Improved   Sample Complexity Bound under the Local Access Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for general-sum Markov games with large state and action spaces. Learning equilibria efficiently in such games is challenging due to the curse of multi-agency, where complexity scales exponentially with number of agents.

- Prior works have used independent linear function approximation to model marginal $Q$ values for each agent, avoiding the curse. But algorithms so far still have suboptimal dependency on accuracy ($\varepsilon$) or action spaces. 

Main Contributions:

- The paper proposes a new algorithm called Linear-Confident-FTRL for learning coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) in independent linear MARL, using local access to a simulator.

- The algorithm maintains core sets for each agent to store useful state-action information. Agents perform decentralized policy learning on their core sets. The sets expand when new uncertain states are encountered.

- Theoretical analysis shows the algorithm learns $\varepsilon$-CCE with near optimal $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ accuracy dependence and no linear dependency on action space, when state space is not too large. Dependencies on other parameters like number of agents, time horizon are polynomial.

- Analysis technique generalizes virtual policy iteration from single agent local planning to multi-agent games. This yields an improved algorithm under the stronger random access model.

- Algorithm design ensures limited communication between agents. Total communication is similar to prior approaches.

In summary, the paper makes both algorithmic and theoretical contributions to overcome challenges in independent linear MARL under local and random access models. The proposed methods have optimal or near optimal performance bounds compared to prior art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new algorithm, Linear-Confident-FTRL, for efficiently learning coarse correlated equilibria in multi-agent Markov games with independent linear function approximation under the local access model, achieving near optimal sample complexity bounds that eliminate the dependency on the action space size when the state space is not exponentially large.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new algorithm called Linear-Confident-FTRL for efficiently learning coarse correlated equilibria in Markov games with independent linear function approximation under the local access model. The key contributions are:

1) The algorithm achieves near-optimal sample complexity bounds that scale as Õ(ε^{-2}) and eliminate the dependency on the action space size in certain regimes. This improves upon prior works that had suboptimal Õ(ε^{-4}) dependency or linear dependency on the action space. 

2) The analysis introduces a virtual algorithm technique that helps connect the performance within and outside the algorithm's "core sets". This analysis approach generalizes virtual policy iteration ideas from single-agent RL to the multi-agent game setting.

3) As a byproduct of the virtual algorithm analysis, the paper derives a new algorithm under the random access model that attains tighter sample complexity compared to prior arts. When the state space is not exponentially large, this new algorithm is minimax optimal.

4) The algorithm design and analysis provide one of the first results in multi-agent reinforcement learning under the local access model. The algorithm can be implemented in a decentralized manner with limited communication.

In summary, the key innovation is introducing tools from single-agent RL, like core sets and virtual algorithms, into the multi-agent game setting to achieve tighter performance guarantees. The results also expand our understanding of learning in games under flexible sampling protocols like local access.
