# [Automated Planning Techniques for Elementary Proofs in Abstract Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06490)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores the novel application of automated planning techniques to automated theorem proving in abstract algebra. The authors implement the axioms and elementary operations of commutative rings to model an algebraic domain. They then use planners in both deterministic and non-deterministic settings to automatically generate proofs of basic results, such as the uniqueness of additive inverses. The planners are able to successfully construct valid, logical proofs by chaining together allowed actions corresponding to equalities, implications, axioms, etc. The introduction of undeclared variables poses an additional challenge. While the deterministic planner can handle simple proofs with undeclared variables, more complex proofs require the dynamic assignment of multiple variables, which current planners struggle with. The non-deterministic domain allows the modeling of more advanced algebraic structures like integral domains. Overall, the success of the planners suggests that automated planning techniques can be fruitfully applied to automated theorem proving. The algebraic domain also provides a novel, difficult benchmark for testing automated planners. Further work is needed to scale up the complexity of proofs, better handle undeclared variables, and further bridge the gap between generated proofs and human-readable proofs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores applying automated planning techniques to automated theorem proving in abstract algebra. Automated theorem proving aims to automatically generate mathematical proofs, but faces challenges in efficiently searching large state spaces.  

- The paper notes automated planning is good at searching large state spaces, but has not been applied to automated theorem proving.

- Abstract algebra provides a good test domain, with its axiomatic system and need to prove even basic results like a Ã— 0 = 0.

Solution:
- The paper models the axioms of commutative rings and basic implications and equalities as planning operators. Both deterministic and non-deterministic planning models are created.

- In the deterministic model, the authors prove simple results like the uniqueness of additive inverses. The introduction of "undeclared variables" that can be assigned by the planner is also explored.

- In the non-deterministic model, more complex proofs by cases and contradiction are implemented. As an example, a proof of the cancellative law for integral domains is modeled.

Contributions:
- Shows automated planning can be used for automated theorem proving in abstract algebra, providing proofs for various basic results.

- Introduces abstract algebra as a new challenging benchmark domain for testing automated planners, given its complex axiomatic structure.

- The non-deterministic model and undeclared variables pose difficulties for current planners, identifying areas for further research in planning systems. 

- Establishes a methodology for translating mathematical proofs into planning models, providing opportunities to apply automated planning in new ways.

In summary, the paper makes an important connection between two subfields of AI, proposing automated planning as a new approach to automating mathematical proofs. Both fields stand to benefit from this synergy through new research directions and benchmark problems.

This paper demonstrates the application of automated planning techniques to automated theorem proving by modeling commutative rings in deterministic and non-deterministic planning domains and using planners to generate elementary proofs about them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating the application of automated planning techniques to automated theorem proving in the domain of abstract algebra. Specifically, the paper:

- Implements basic implications, equalities, and rules to model commutative rings in both deterministic and non-deterministic planning domains.

- Shows how planners can find plans/sequences of actions that correspond to correct proofs of elementary results in abstract algebra, such as proving properties of additive inverses and multiplicative identities. 

- Provides examples of planners finding proofs in the fully observable deterministic (FOD) and fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) settings.

- Discusses the challenges posed by introducing undeclared variables and more complex reasoning in the planning domains.  

- Argues that automated planning provides new techniques and benchmark problems for automated theorem proving, while automated theorem proving also poses novel and challenging domains for testing automated planners.

In summary, the main contribution is using ideas and techniques from automated planning to tackle problems in the field of automated theorem proving, using abstract algebra as a sample domain. The results suggest these fields can mutually benefit each other.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes modeling commutative ring axioms and operations as planning actions. What are some potential challenges or limitations of encoding mathematical concepts as planning actions? How might they be addressed?

2. The paper demonstrates proving simple statements like "a x 0 = 0" using planning. What are some more complex theorems from abstract algebra that could be interesting challenge problems for this approach? How might you model the steps needed to prove them?

3. The paper introduces the idea of "undeclared variables" to allow more flexibility in constructing proofs. What enhancements could be made to the planner or domain encoding to handle additional undeclared variables? How might this increase proof complexity? 

4. The paper shows a proof of the cancellation law in integral domains using a FOND planner. What other non-deterministic algebra concepts could be modeled this way? What extensions would be needed to handle more complex case-based proofs?

5. The paper notes that planner solutions don't always match human intuition. How could the planning domain be refined to generate more intuitive, human-readable proofs? What criteria determine proof readability?

6. How does the performance of different planning algorithms compare on this domain? What enhancements could be made to existing planners to handle the complexity introduced by mathematical reasoning? 

7. The authors suggest this approach could be extended to groups, rings, fields etc. What would be the key differences in modeling different algebraic structures? What new axioms would need to be encoded?

8. What metrics could be used to evaluate the quality of automatically generated proofs besides length? How can optimality be defined for mathematical proofs? 

9. The authors propose this domain as a benchmark for planning. What specific proof challenges could be used to test planner scalability? What lengths of proofs start to cause issues?

10. How could this approach be integrated into an interactive theorem proving system? Could planning help suggest useful proof steps or lemmas to users?
