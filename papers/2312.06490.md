# [Automated Planning Techniques for Elementary Proofs in Abstract Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06490)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores the novel application of automated planning techniques to automated theorem proving in abstract algebra. The authors implement the axioms and elementary operations of commutative rings to model an algebraic domain. They then use planners in both deterministic and non-deterministic settings to automatically generate proofs of basic results, such as the uniqueness of additive inverses. The planners are able to successfully construct valid, logical proofs by chaining together allowed actions corresponding to equalities, implications, axioms, etc. The introduction of undeclared variables poses an additional challenge. While the deterministic planner can handle simple proofs with undeclared variables, more complex proofs require the dynamic assignment of multiple variables, which current planners struggle with. The non-deterministic domain allows the modeling of more advanced algebraic structures like integral domains. Overall, the success of the planners suggests that automated planning techniques can be fruitfully applied to automated theorem proving. The algebraic domain also provides a novel, difficult benchmark for testing automated planners. Further work is needed to scale up the complexity of proofs, better handle undeclared variables, and further bridge the gap between generated proofs and human-readable proofs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores applying automated planning techniques to automated theorem proving in abstract algebra. Automated theorem proving aims to automatically generate mathematical proofs, but faces challenges in efficiently searching large state spaces.  

- The paper notes automated planning is good at searching large state spaces, but has not been applied to automated theorem proving.

- Abstract algebra provides a good test domain, with its axiomatic system and need to prove even basic results like a Ã— 0 = 0.

Solution:
- The paper models the axioms of commutative rings and basic implications and equalities as planning operators. Both deterministic and non-deterministic planning models are created.

- In the deterministic model, the authors prove simple results like the uniqueness of additive inverses. The introduction of "undeclared variables" that can be assigned by the planner is also explored.

- In the non-deterministic model, more complex proofs by cases and contradiction are implemented. As an example, a proof of the cancellative law for integral domains is modeled.

Contributions:
- Shows automated planning can be used for automated theorem proving in abstract algebra, providing proofs for various basic results.

- Introduces abstract algebra as a new challenging benchmark domain for testing automated planners, given its complex axiomatic structure.

- The non-deterministic model and undeclared variables pose difficulties for current planners, identifying areas for further research in planning systems. 

- Establishes a methodology for translating mathematical proofs into planning models, providing opportunities to apply automated planning in new ways.

In summary, the paper makes an important connection between two subfields of AI, proposing automated planning as a new approach to automating mathematical proofs. Both fields stand to benefit from this synergy through new research directions and benchmark problems.
