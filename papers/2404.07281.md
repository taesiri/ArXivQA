# [Certifying almost all quantum states with few single-qubit measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07281)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of efficiently certifying that an experimental $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$ has high fidelity (overlap) with a target pure state $\ket{\psi}$, using only simple single-qubit measurements on copies of $\rho$. This certification task is challenging when $\ket{\psi}$ is a highly entangled state that may require exponential circuit complexity to create. Prior protocols either need deep quantum circuits applied to $\rho$, exponential many single-qubit measurements on $\rho$, or only work for special families of $\ket{\psi}$. The main open question is whether there exists an efficient certification protocol relying solely on few single-qubit measurements that can validate the overlap of $\rho$ with a generic target state $\ket{\psi}$.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a new protocol that provides an efficient solution to this task for almost all $n$-qubit pure states $\ket{\psi}$. The protocol is based on a quantity called "shadow overlap", obtained by performing single-qubit Pauli measurements on separate copies of $\rho$ and querying an efficient classical representation (or "model") of $\ket{\psi}$. The expected shadow overlap lower bounds the fidelity between $\rho$ and $\ket{\psi}$. 

The analysis relates the shadow overlap to the relaxation time of a Markov chain on the $n$-bit Boolean hypercube defined by the measurement probabilities of $\ket{\psi}$. Using new techniques based on multicommodity flows, it is shown that almost all $n$-qubit states exhibit a polynomial relaxation time, implying that their fidelity can be efficiently certified with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ single-qubit measurements on $\rho$. Remarkably, this holds even for states with exponential circuit complexity. The protocol and analysis are versatile enough to handle various structured states too.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of the "shadow overlap" formalism that offers an efficient surrogate for fidelity using few single-qubit measurements, with rigorous performance guarantees.

- Proof that almost all $n$-qubit states can be certified using the shadow overlap with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ samples, including states that require exponential size quantum circuits to create.

- Demonstration of promising applications in machine learning tomography of quantum states, benchmarking quantum devices, optimizing variational quantum circuits, and estimating sparse properties of quantum systems.

- Numerical experiments on systems with up to 120 qubits validating the usefulness of shadow overlaps in practical contexts compared to conventional approaches.

The results significantly expand the applicability of efficient quantum state certification and benchmarking using minimal experimental capabilities. The analysis based on relating certification to Markov chain mixing times provides new insights into correlations in complex quantum states.
