# [Looking Inside Out: Anticipating Driver Intent From Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Anticipating driver intent is critical for improving road safety when vehicles with varying autonomy share roads. 
- Prior works utilize in-cabin sensing but find that adding external sensing decreases accuracy. Recent state-of-the-art methods thus rely solely on internal cameras and vehicle dynamics.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel method to extract and leverage both internal (gaze, pose) and external (objects, lanes) features to better anticipate driver actions.
- They design an LSTM and a Transformer architecture to fuse these multi-modal features for sequential prediction.
- The external features are explicitly extracted rather than learned end-to-end, as road context provides critical cues about feasible maneuvers.

Key Results:
- Both proposed architectures outperform prior state-of-the-art with accuracy of 87.5% and early average prediction times of 4.35 seconds.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the value of the hand-crafted external features. 
- The Transformer can capture long-term temporal dependencies that the LSTM cannot, though more data is likely needed for the Transformer to significantly surpass the LSTM.

In summary, this paper makes the key insight that leveraging both internal and external sensing with hand-designed feature representations can better anticipate driver intent compared to prior work, enabling earlier and more reliable predictions. The proposed LSTM and Transformer architectures set new state-of-the-art results on a standard driving dataset.
