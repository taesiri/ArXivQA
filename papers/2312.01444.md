# [Looking Inside Out: Anticipating Driver Intent From Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Anticipating driver intent is critical for improving road safety when vehicles with varying autonomy share roads. 
- Prior works utilize in-cabin sensing but find that adding external sensing decreases accuracy. Recent state-of-the-art methods thus rely solely on internal cameras and vehicle dynamics.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel method to extract and leverage both internal (gaze, pose) and external (objects, lanes) features to better anticipate driver actions.
- They design an LSTM and a Transformer architecture to fuse these multi-modal features for sequential prediction.
- The external features are explicitly extracted rather than learned end-to-end, as road context provides critical cues about feasible maneuvers.

Key Results:
- Both proposed architectures outperform prior state-of-the-art with accuracy of 87.5% and early average prediction times of 4.35 seconds.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the value of the hand-crafted external features. 
- The Transformer can capture long-term temporal dependencies that the LSTM cannot, though more data is likely needed for the Transformer to significantly surpass the LSTM.

In summary, this paper makes the key insight that leveraging both internal and external sensing with hand-designed feature representations can better anticipate driver intent compared to prior work, enabling earlier and more reliable predictions. The proposed LSTM and Transformer architectures set new state-of-the-art results on a standard driving dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes novel LSTM and transformer architectures that fuse handcrafted in-cabin and exterior camera features to achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting future driver actions from videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel method to predict driver intentions across 5 driving maneuvers that fuses handcrafted feature representations from both the in-cabin and exterior cameras. Specifically:

- They extract gaze, head pose, object, and road-level features from the camera data rather than learning representations in an end-to-end manner. 

- They employ LSTM and transformer-based architectures to combine the interior and exterior feature vectors for predicting driver intent.

- Their approaches outperform prior state-of-the-art methods on key metrics - achieving 87.2% and 87.5% accuracy with the LSTM and transformer architectures respectively. 

- They are able to predict driver maneuvers earlier (4.34 and 4.35 seconds before on average) compared to prior works.

In summary, the main contribution is showing that fusing handcrafted in-cabin and exterior feature representations with sequential models improves performance on anticipating driver intent over prior methods that use end-to-end learning or only interior information.

The paper proposes LSTM and transformer-based architectures to predict future driver actions using handcrafted features extracted from in-cabin camera (gaze, head pose) and external camera (object detections, road features). The methods outperform prior state-of-the-art approaches on metrics like accuracy and average prediction time before the maneuver takes place. Key terms like "driver intent prediction", "LSTM", "transformer", "in-cabin camera", "external camera", "handcrafted features", "accuracy", and "time-until-maneuver" capture the core focus and contributions of the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using handcrafted features from the in-cabin and external camera data as inputs to the models instead of learning representations in an end-to-end manner. What is the rationale behind this design choice? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages?

2. The gaze vector is represented as a 4D vector with x,y coordinates projected onto an imaginary plane representing the windshield. What is the intuition behind this representation and how might it capture finer-grained eye movements compared to histogram approaches? 

3. The paper extracts top 5 object detections by area per frame. How might the choice of N affect model performance? What are some alternative approaches for selecting object detections as inputs?

4. What motivated the design choice of using separate LSTMs and linear projections for each modality in the F-LSTM and F-TF architectures? How do the results support or refute this choice?

5. The paper hypothesizes that the F-TF would scale more effectively given more training data compared to other approaches. What evidence from prior work on transformers supports this claim? What experiments could be run to test this hypothesis?

6. How exactly does the self-attention mechanism in the transformer enable modeling of long-range dependencies compared to LSTMs? Provide some visualizations from the attention maps to illustrate this conceptually. 

7. The F-TF architecture has higher variance across validation splits compared to the F-LSTM. What are some potential reasons for this higher variance and how might this issue be addressed?

8. What modifications could be made to the GRU-based architecture from prior work to incorporate the proposed exterior features? How might this compare performance-wise to the F-LSTM and F-TF?

9. The paper evaluates performance using accuracy, F1, and time-until-maneuver. What other evaluation metrics could provide useful insights on model performance for this task?

10. If deployed, what real-world factors might degrade model performance compared to the offline evaluation results presented in the paper? How could the approach be adapted to account for these factors?
