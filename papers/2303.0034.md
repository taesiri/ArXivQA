# [A Comprehensive Perturbative Formalism for Phase Mixing in Perturbed   Disks. II. Phase Spirals in an Inhomogeneous Disk Galaxy with a   Non-responsive Dark Matter Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.0034)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) How does an inhomogeneous stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo respond to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies? In particular, what is the resulting phase-space structure and evolution of the response? 2) How do phase-space spirals or "snails" form in the vertical phase-space of disk stars following a perturbation? How do their structure and evolution depend on the nature of the perturbation and properties of the disk and halo?3) Can the observed phase-space spirals in the Milky Way disk provide constraints on the past history of perturbations to the Galaxy as well as the gravitational potential of the disk and halo?The authors develop a theoretical framework to analyze the linear response of a collisionless stellar disk to general perturbations. They apply this to compute the disk response and resulting phase-space spirals for different perturbations like bars, spiral arms, and satellite encounters. A key goal is to understand if and how phase-space spirals can be used to uncover the perturbation history and gravitational potential of galaxies like the Milky Way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic disk to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and satellite galaxy impacts. The key points are:- It computes the linear response of a realistic stellar disk, characterized by a pseudo-isothermal distribution function and embedded in a dark matter halo, to general perturbations. - Without self-gravity to reinforce it, the response phase mixes away due to the intrinsic spread in stellar oscillation frequencies, giving rise to phase-space spirals. - Collisional diffusion damps the response and phase spirals on a timescale of 0.6-0.7 Gyr in the Solar neighborhood.- Transient, rapidly varying bars/spirals are needed to trigger vertical phase-spirals. Persistent patterns with fixed pattern speeds drive coherent oscillations rather than phase mixing.- Slower satellite flybys excite predominantly bending modes while faster ones trigger breathing modes. Among MW satellites, Sagittarius triggers the strongest response and is the leading culprit if the Gaia snail was caused by a satellite.- The presence of a dark matter halo leads to slower phase mixing and more loosely wound phase-spirals compared to a disk-only case.In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework to model the formation and evolution of phase-spirals in response to perturbations, with implications for galactic dynamics and galaxy potential constraints. The key contribution is a detailed perturbative analysis applied to a realistic galactic disk system.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper develops a theoretical framework to model the response of a galactic disk embedded in a dark matter halo to perturbations like transient spiral arms, bars, or encounters with satellite galaxies, with a focus on analyzing the resulting phase-space spirals and their dependence on the perturbation timescale and galactic potential.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on phase spirals and disk dynamics:- This paper builds on the previous work by the same authors (Banik et al. 2022, referred to as Paper I) to develop a more comprehensive theoretical framework for modeling phase spirals in galactic disks. It improves upon the simple isothermal slab model used in Paper I by considering a more realistic disk model and including the effects of a dark matter halo. - Compared to other theoretical studies, this paper provides a more general treatment of how different types of perturbations (bars, spirals, satellite interactions) can excite phase spirals in disks. It derives analytical expressions for the response that provide physical insight into how the timescale and symmetry of the perturbation impacts the bending vs breathing modes.- In terms of comparing to simulations, this paper complements recent N-body studies focused specifically on the interaction between the Milky Way and Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (e.g. Hunt et al. 2021). The analytical framework here allows exploring a wider range of encounter parameters. The results on bending vs breathing modes are qualitatively consistent with the simulations. - Observationally, this paper does not analyze new data, but provides interpretation of existing results, especially Antoja et al. (2018) discovery of the snail shell phase spiral in Gaia data. It supports the idea that this spiral could have been triggered by Sagittarius, but suggests the timing needs to be more recent than sometimes assumed.- Overall, this paper makes an important theoretical contribution by developing more sophisticated analytical models for phase spirals in galactic disks. It demonstrates these models by providing insights into the vertical oscillations and spiral structure of the Milky Way disk. This framework can serve as a foundation for future studies to make further links between theory and observations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Including the effects of self-gravity of the disk response to perturbations. The authors note that self-gravity can enhance the amplitude of phase-spirals and cause coherent oscillations of the disk as a whole. However, a more detailed theoretical description of the self-gravitating response of realistic, inhomogeneous disks is needed.- Accounting for the indirect response of the disk due to perturbations in the dark matter halo triggered by events like satellite encounters. The authors suggest this halo response could be comparable to the direct disk response and merits further analysis. - Using phase-spirals to constrain the total galactic potential. The authors propose the detailed shape of phase-spirals can constrain the disk+halo potential if triggered by a single, impulsive perturbation. But they note this technique needs further development to account for cases with overlapping perturbations.- Including dynamical friction in estimating the disk response to satellite encounters. The orbit evolution of satellites due to dynamical friction can affect disk crossing times and responses.- Exploring triggers for the two-armed phase-spiral in the inner Milky Way disk. The authors suggest this breathing mode feature is unexpected and its origin is unclear. Further work is needed to examine if realistic bar/spiral arm perturbations could cause it.- Studying the self-gravitating response of disks to general perturbations beyond bars, such as spiral arms and satellite encounters. A more generic theoretical framework is needed.In summary, the authors highlight the need to expand the theoretical framework developed here to include additional physical effects like self-gravity and halo perturbations. They also suggest follow-up work to apply phase-spirals to constrain galactic potentials and understand the origins of observed phase-spiral features.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and satellite galaxy encounters. It computes the resulting phase-space spirals or "snails" from the phase-mixing of the disk response. The shape and survival of these snails against collisional damping provides information on the perturbation history and gravitational potential. The analysis shows that transient, rapidly evolving bars/spirals are needed to create vertical snails, while slow satellite flybys mainly trigger in-plane responses. Sagittarius is likely the main satellite contributor to the Solar neighborhood snail, requiring an impact 0.6-0.7 Gyr ago to survive damping. Overall, this theoretical treatment elucidates how phase-space spirals can be used to uncover the disk's dynamical history and galactic potential.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic disk to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies. It focuses on the vertical oscillations and phase mixing of stars that give rise to phase-space spirals or "snails" observed in Gaia data. The authors model the unperturbed galaxy as a rotating disk with an exponential radial profile, isothermal vertical structure, and embedded in a dark matter halo. They apply linear perturbation theory to derive the first-order response of the disk distribution function to a time-dependent perturbing potential. Without self-gravity to reinforce the response, it phase mixes away due to the spread in vertical, radial, and azimuthal frequencies of stars, giving rise to local phase-space spirals. The paper computes the disk response and resulting phase-spirals for transient and persistent bars/spirals as well as satellite encounters. It finds that the spiral's coarse-grained amplitude damps as 1/t in a realistic disk versus a steeper Gaussian decay in an idealized slab. Collisional diffusion damps the fine-grained amplitude faster in the inner disk and for stars with lower vertical actions. The paper concludes by discussing how the shape of phase-spirals constrains the galactic potential and by summarizing the key results.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper develops a linear perturbative formalism to compute the response of an inhomogeneous stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies. The key aspects are:- The dynamics of stars are modeled using action-angle variables. Each star oscillates with three fundamental frequencies - vertical ($\Omega_z$), radial ($\Omega_r$), and azimuthal ($\Omega_\phi$). - The disk response consists of oscillations at combinations of these three frequencies. Different modes like bending, breathing, etc. correspond to different frequency combinations. - Without self-gravity to reinforce it, the disk response phase mixes away over time due to the spread in oscillation frequencies of stars, giving rise to phase-space spirals. - Collisional diffusion due to scattering against giant molecular clouds causes damping of the phase-spiral amplitude over time.  - The potential of the disk+halo system dictates how the frequencies depend on the actions, which impacts the rate of phase mixing and shape of phase-spirals. This can be used to constrain the galactic potential.In summary, the paper develops a detailed perturbative framework using action-angle variables to study the formation, evolution and damping of phase-spirals in response to different perturbations, and demonstrates how phase-spirals can be used to unravel the perturbation history and galactic potential.
