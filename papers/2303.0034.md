# [A Comprehensive Perturbative Formalism for Phase Mixing in Perturbed   Disks. II. Phase Spirals in an Inhomogeneous Disk Galaxy with a   Non-responsive Dark Matter Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.0034)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) How does an inhomogeneous stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo respond to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies? In particular, what is the resulting phase-space structure and evolution of the response? 2) How do phase-space spirals or "snails" form in the vertical phase-space of disk stars following a perturbation? How do their structure and evolution depend on the nature of the perturbation and properties of the disk and halo?3) Can the observed phase-space spirals in the Milky Way disk provide constraints on the past history of perturbations to the Galaxy as well as the gravitational potential of the disk and halo?The authors develop a theoretical framework to analyze the linear response of a collisionless stellar disk to general perturbations. They apply this to compute the disk response and resulting phase-space spirals for different perturbations like bars, spiral arms, and satellite encounters. A key goal is to understand if and how phase-space spirals can be used to uncover the perturbation history and gravitational potential of galaxies like the Milky Way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic disk to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and satellite galaxy impacts. The key points are:- It computes the linear response of a realistic stellar disk, characterized by a pseudo-isothermal distribution function and embedded in a dark matter halo, to general perturbations. - Without self-gravity to reinforce it, the response phase mixes away due to the intrinsic spread in stellar oscillation frequencies, giving rise to phase-space spirals. - Collisional diffusion damps the response and phase spirals on a timescale of 0.6-0.7 Gyr in the Solar neighborhood.- Transient, rapidly varying bars/spirals are needed to trigger vertical phase-spirals. Persistent patterns with fixed pattern speeds drive coherent oscillations rather than phase mixing.- Slower satellite flybys excite predominantly bending modes while faster ones trigger breathing modes. Among MW satellites, Sagittarius triggers the strongest response and is the leading culprit if the Gaia snail was caused by a satellite.- The presence of a dark matter halo leads to slower phase mixing and more loosely wound phase-spirals compared to a disk-only case.In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework to model the formation and evolution of phase-spirals in response to perturbations, with implications for galactic dynamics and galaxy potential constraints. The key contribution is a detailed perturbative analysis applied to a realistic galactic disk system.
