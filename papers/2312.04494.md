# [AVA: Towards Autonomous Visualization Agents through Visual   Perception-Driven Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04494)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Autonomous Visualization Agents (AVAs), a new paradigm that utilizes the visual perception capabilities of multi-modal large language models to achieve user-specified goals in visualization systems. The authors demonstrate the feasibility of AVAs through several case studies spanning scientific visualization, information visualization, and dimensionality reduction. The key innovation is the tight integration of natural language understanding, visual perception, and autonomous decision making, allowing the agent to interpret visualization outputs and refine parameters to meet predefined objectives. For example, an AVA can autonomously select opacity transfer functions in volume rendering to reveal structures of interest, mitigate overplotting in scatter plots by optimizing point opacity, and find suitable hyperparameters for t-SNE embeddings. The authors collect feedback from AI and medical visualization experts highlighting AVAs' potential to act as virtual assistants that can achieve expert-level visualization tasks. Limitations relate to challenges handling large action spaces and reliance on carefully crafted prompting. Overall, AVAs represent an promising new paradigm for human-AI collaboration in visualization.
