# [The Stack: 3 TB of permissively licensed source code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15533)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are gaining traction for natural language processing and code understanding/generation tasks. However, research on code LLMs lacks openness and transparency around model development and training data. Some models are only available through paid APIs or commercial products. Others publish model weights but not the training data.  

- There are also legal discussions around whether public code repositories can be used to train commercial LLMs. Some argue ML models are derivative works of the training data and must comply with original licenses. Others say fair use exceptions permit using public code, but ethical concerns remain about consent and attribution.

- Overall, there is a need for an open, transparent dataset that enables responsible research on code LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce "The Stack", a 3.1 TB dataset of permissively licensed source code in 30 languages, collected from 137M public GitHub repos.

- They extract permissively licensed subsets, removing copyleft licenses like GPL. Weak copyleft licenses were erroneously included but have now been removed.  

- Near-deduplication further reduces the dataset by 38.6%. Exact deduplication was also applied.

- Data governance gives developers the ability to opt-out and have their code excluded. More governance capabilities are still in development.

Main Contributions:
- Released The Stack dataset with over 3TB of permissively licensed code for open and responsible research on code LLMs. It is 3x larger than alternatives like CodeParrot.

- Show near-deduplication significantly boosts performance of 350M parameter decoders trained on Python subsets. Match Codex and CodeGen benchmarks with only permissively licensed data.

- Started developing data governance plan to give developers control over inclusion of their data, with instructions at bigcode-project.org and a tool to search the dataset.

- Discussed limitations around potential licensing misclassification, PII, malicious code, bias toward popular languages, and model evaluation on a single programming language.

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed solution, dataset characteristics, experiments, results, and limitations. It highlights the main goals and contributions around releasing an open, transparent code dataset to enable responsible research on code LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces The Stack, a 3.1 TB dataset of permissively licensed source code in 30 programming languages, shows promising results training decoders on Python subsets, and provides a data governance plan to give developers control over their code's inclusion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Introducing The Stack, a large dataset of over 3 TB of permissively licensed source code in 30 programming languages. This helps enable open and responsible research on large language models for code.

2) Training 350M parameter decoder-only transformers on different Python subsets of The Stack. The experiments show that near-deduplication significantly improves performance, and it's possible to match state-of-the-art text2code models using only the permissively licensed data.

3) Releasing The Stack dataset along with a near-deduplicated version to enable further research. The authors also provide tools like "Am I in The Stack" to help developers search for their code.

4) Presenting a data governance plan that gives developers the ability to opt-out and have their code removed from The Stack. This supports developer agency over their source code.

In summary, the main highlights are releasing a large permissively licensed code dataset to stimulate open research, showing promising experimental results when training models on this data, and providing a responsible data governance plan.

The paper introduces a large dataset called "The Stack" containing over 3TB of permissively licensed source code for training large language models. It analyzes the dataset, shows promising results on text-to-code benchmarks using subsets of the data, and discusses plans for data governance including an opt-out process for developers. Overall, the key focus areas are around releasing a high-quality code dataset to stimulate open and responsible LLM research.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using MinHash and Locality Sensitive Hashing for near-duplicate detection. Could you explain more about how these algorithms work and why they are effective for code deduplication? 

2. You apply several filters to the raw GitHub data, such as removing binary files, empty files, and large non-code files. What is the motivation behind each of these filters? How significantly do they reduce the dataset size?

3. For licensing detection, you use the confidence scores from the go-license-detector. What threshold do you use on the confidence scores to determine if a license is detected? How does this threshold impact the amount of data labeled as permissively licensed?

4. In the data contamination analysis, you only search for exact matches of evaluation set prompts. Why not use semantic similarity metrics to find paraphrased prompts as well? Would semantic duplication also impact model performance?

5. You experiment with decoder-only transformer models trained via causal language modeling. What motivated this choice over other model architectures like encoder-decoders? What are the tradeoffs?

6. For the text-to-code experiments, you evaluate on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by sampling 200 programs per problem. How sensitive are the reported metrics based on the number of samples? Have you experimented with more samples?

7. You show the impact of near-deduplication and permissive licensing on model performance. Have you analyzed the model outputs to understand if there are qualitative differences between these models?

8. The data governance plan describes allowing developers to opt-out of the dataset. In practice, how easy/difficult is it to honor granular data removal requests at scale while maintaining dataset integrity?  

9. You filtered programming languages down to 30 based on popularity. What metrics did you use to determine popularity? Are there ethical concerns with emphasizing mainstream languages over niche ones?

10. The social impact discussion highlights concerns around potential harms of code LLMs. What proactive steps are you taking around model monitoring, transparency, and controls to mitigate these risks?
