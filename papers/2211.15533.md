# [The Stack: 3 TB of permissively licensed source code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15533)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are gaining traction for natural language processing and code understanding/generation tasks. However, research on code LLMs lacks openness and transparency around model development and training data. Some models are only available through paid APIs or commercial products. Others publish model weights but not the training data.  

- There are also legal discussions around whether public code repositories can be used to train commercial LLMs. Some argue ML models are derivative works of the training data and must comply with original licenses. Others say fair use exceptions permit using public code, but ethical concerns remain about consent and attribution.

- Overall, there is a need for an open, transparent dataset that enables responsible research on code LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce "The Stack", a 3.1 TB dataset of permissively licensed source code in 30 languages, collected from 137M public GitHub repos.

- They extract permissively licensed subsets, removing copyleft licenses like GPL. Weak copyleft licenses were erroneously included but have now been removed.  

- Near-deduplication further reduces the dataset by 38.6%. Exact deduplication was also applied.

- Data governance gives developers the ability to opt-out and have their code excluded. More governance capabilities are still in development.

Main Contributions:
- Released The Stack dataset with over 3TB of permissively licensed code for open and responsible research on code LLMs. It is 3x larger than alternatives like CodeParrot.

- Show near-deduplication significantly boosts performance of 350M parameter decoders trained on Python subsets. Match Codex and CodeGen benchmarks with only permissively licensed data.

- Started developing data governance plan to give developers control over inclusion of their data, with instructions at bigcode-project.org and a tool to search the dataset.

- Discussed limitations around potential licensing misclassification, PII, malicious code, bias toward popular languages, and model evaluation on a single programming language.

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed solution, dataset characteristics, experiments, results, and limitations. It highlights the main goals and contributions around releasing an open, transparent code dataset to enable responsible research on code LLMs.
