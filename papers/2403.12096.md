# [Enriching User Shopping History: Empowering E-commerce with a   Hierarchical Recommendation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12096)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In real-world e-commerce, users often shop across multiple platforms, so no single platform has the user's full shopping history. This data sparsity limits the accuracy of recommendations. 
- Enriching the incomplete user shopping history on a platform can improve recommendation performance.

Proposed Solution:
- A hierarchical recommendation system with two levels:
   1) Shopping history enrichment level 
       - Uses a bidirectional transformer (BERT) to predict likely missing purchases in the incomplete user shopping history sequence. Imaginary "masks" representing missing purchases are added to the sequence and BERT predicts the most probable item for each mask.
   2) Next item recommendation level  
       - Uses a sequential self-attention model (SASRec) to predict the next item by taking the enriched shopping history from level 1 as input.

- Tries two approaches to place imaginary masks for enrichment:
   1) Random positions 
   2) Between detected shopping sessions

Contributions:
- Showed that enriching user shopping histories improves next item recommendation performance on 3 Amazon datasets over baselines.
- Placing imaginary masks between sessions is better than random placement.  
- Performance saturates and then declines as more masks are added beyond an optimal point. The key is placing masks in the "right" positions rather than just adding more masks.
- The approach can benefit not only users with short histories but also those with longer histories.
- The hierarchical enrichment approach provides a more personalized and accurate recommendation system for real-world e-commerce.

In summary, the key idea is to enrich incomplete user shopping histories by predicting missing purchases, in order to improve sequential recommendation performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this hierarchical history enrichment approach.
