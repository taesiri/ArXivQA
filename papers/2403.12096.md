# [Enriching User Shopping History: Empowering E-commerce with a   Hierarchical Recommendation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12096)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In real-world e-commerce, users often shop across multiple platforms, so no single platform has the user's full shopping history. This data sparsity limits the accuracy of recommendations. 
- Enriching the incomplete user shopping history on a platform can improve recommendation performance.

Proposed Solution:
- A hierarchical recommendation system with two levels:
   1) Shopping history enrichment level 
       - Uses a bidirectional transformer (BERT) to predict likely missing purchases in the incomplete user shopping history sequence. Imaginary "masks" representing missing purchases are added to the sequence and BERT predicts the most probable item for each mask.
   2) Next item recommendation level  
       - Uses a sequential self-attention model (SASRec) to predict the next item by taking the enriched shopping history from level 1 as input.

- Tries two approaches to place imaginary masks for enrichment:
   1) Random positions 
   2) Between detected shopping sessions

Contributions:
- Showed that enriching user shopping histories improves next item recommendation performance on 3 Amazon datasets over baselines.
- Placing imaginary masks between sessions is better than random placement.  
- Performance saturates and then declines as more masks are added beyond an optimal point. The key is placing masks in the "right" positions rather than just adding more masks.
- The approach can benefit not only users with short histories but also those with longer histories.
- The hierarchical enrichment approach provides a more personalized and accurate recommendation system for real-world e-commerce.

In summary, the key idea is to enrich incomplete user shopping histories by predicting missing purchases, in order to improve sequential recommendation performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this hierarchical history enrichment approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a hierarchical recommendation system with two levels - first enriching users' shopping histories by predicting missing purchases using a bidirectional transformer model, and then feeding the completed histories into a self-attention model to provide more accurate next item recommendations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a hierarchical recommendation system that first enriches the user's shopping history by predicting missing purchases they may have made on other e-commerce platforms. It then uses this enriched shopping history to provide more accurate recommendations of the next item the user is likely to purchase. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Enriching the user's shopping history by adding predicted intermediate purchases improves the performance of recommending the next item they will purchase. This helps address data sparsity issues arising from users spreading purchases across multiple platforms.

2) Determining the right approach to select locations within the shopping history to enrich with predicted purchases is important. Placing them between identified shopping sessions works better than random placement.

3) When enriching the shopping history, the number of added predictions is less important than placing them appropriately. So a sufficient yet not excessive number of enriched data points in the right locations is best.

In summary, the main contribution is a two-level hierarchical recommendation system that first enriches a partial user shopping history and then leverages the improved history to make better next item recommendations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- User shopping history enrichment
- Recommendation systems
- Transformers
- Hierarchical recommendation system
- Bidirectional encoder representations
- Self-attention model
- SASRec
- Hit rate (HR)
- Normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)

The paper proposes a hierarchical recommendation system for e-commerce that has two main levels: (1) enriching the user's shopping history using a bidirectional encoder representations model, and (2) recommending next items accurately using a self-attention model called SASRec. The goal is to enrich incomplete user shopping histories from real-world e-commerce platforms in order to provide more accurate recommendations. The methods are evaluated using HR and NDCG metrics on three Amazon review datasets, and show improved performance over baseline methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical recommendation system with two main levels. What are these two levels and what is the purpose of each level? Explain in detail. 

2. The first level of the hierarchical recommendation system enriches the user's shopping history using a bidirectional encoder representations model. Explain how this model works, its components, and how it is used to predict missing items in the user's shopping history.

3. The paper evaluates two approaches for determining which locations in the user's shopping history to choose for enrichment - random locations vs between shopping sessions. Compare and contrast these approaches and discuss which provides better performance based on the results. 

4. Explain the overall architecture, components, and working of the self-attention based sequential recommendation model used in the second level of the hierarchy to predict the next item. 

5. The method aims to address the problem of data sparsity and incomplete user histories in real-world e-commerce platforms. Elaborate how the proposed hierarchical enrichment approach addresses this problem.

6. Discuss the key hyperparameters and implementation details of the BERT model used for shopping history enrichment and the SASRec model used for next item recommendation. 

7. Analyze the results of the different end-to-end test scenarios evaluated and discuss how they provide answers to the three research questions formulated in the paper.

8. The enriched histories are used as input to a SASRec model for next item prediction. Why and how does enrichment improve recommendation performance compared to directly using the original history?

9. The paper analyzes the effect of the number of masks on performance. Summarize this analysis and discuss the inferences made regarding appropriate level of enrichment.  

10. Suggest ways in which the proposed hierarchical history enrichment approach can be extended or improved further. Discuss any limitations of the current approach.
