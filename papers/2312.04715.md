# [Deep Emotions Across Languages: A Novel Approach for Sentiment   Propagation in Multilingual WordNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04715)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentiment analysis relies on sentiment-annotated resources like WordNets, but manual annotation is expensive and time-consuming, resulting in limited coverage. 
- Existing methods for automatic sentiment propagation in WordNets are limited to single languages and do not fully capture semantic relationships.
- State-of-the-art neural models like BERT are computationally expensive for specialized tasks like multilingual sentiment propagation.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two new techniques - Multilingual Structured Synset Embeddings (MSSE) and Cross-Lingual Deep Neural Sentiment Propagation (CLDNSP).
- MSSE leverages graph structure and interlingual links between Princeton WordNet and Polish WordNet to learn multilingual embeddings capturing semantic and emotional information.
- CLDNSP uses MSSE embeddings as input to a deep neural network to automatically propagate multilabel sentiment annotations between connected WordNets.

Main Contributions:
- MSSE provides an effective way to learn cross-lingual embeddings encoding emotions for WordNet expansion.
- CLDNSP allows automatic propagation of rich sentiment information across languages without manual effort. 
- Combining MSSE and CLDNSP (MD configuration) outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for sentiment propagation.
- Framework enables large-scale enrichment of multilingual WordNets with emotion metadata for enhanced sentiment analysis.
- Eliminates need for costly annotation and offers more efficient alternative compared to large neural models.

In summary, this paper introduces an innovative multilingual propagation framework to overcome limitations in sentiment-annotated lexical resources across languages. The techniques provide an efficient way to enrich WordNets with emotional information automatically using graph-based embeddings and neural networks.
