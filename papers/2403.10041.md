# [Towards Embedding Dynamic Personas in Interactive Robots: Masquerading   Animated Social Kinematics (MASK)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to develop an interactive robotic system that can take on different personas to provide an immersive and engaging experience for users. Specifically, the goal is to embed character-like attributes into robots through non-verbal behavior so that they can convey distinct personas. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes the Masquerading Animated Social Kinematics (MASK) framework that facilitates persona-based non-verbal human-robot interactions. The key components of MASK are:

- Perception Engine: Extracts features like user's pose, gaze, distance etc. from RGBD images to understand user behavior.

- Behavior Selection Engine: Selects appropriate robotic motions and facial expressions based on user behavior, current state and persona using a pre-built behavior database. 

- Persona Infuser: Automates behavior database generation using large language models, requiring only the persona description as input.

- Action Library: Library of various robotic motions and facial expressions that are displayed based on selections from behavior engine.

The core idea is to have a finite state machine that transitions between robotic behaviors based on observations and persona. The persona infuser module allows easy adoption of new personas with minimal human effort.

Contributions:

- Proposes an interactive robot system to display different personas through non-verbal behavior.

- Introduces Persona Infuser module that automates behavior generation for new personas using LLMs.

- Evaluates with 4 distinct personas based on film characters and conducts user study with 108 people. Achieves 76.7% accuracy in persona identification.

- Provides insights on importance of user interpretation and limitations of current system for longer interactions.

The key highlight is the ability to easily create interactive robots with customizable personas using the behavior generation pipeline. The user studies demonstrate convincing persona display capability.
