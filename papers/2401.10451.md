# [Learning-assisted Stochastic Capacity Expansion Planning: A Bayesian   Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Capacity expansion problems (CEPs) are crucial for planning cost-effective decarbonization of energy systems, but embedding uncertainty from variable renewable energy (VRE) and demand makes them computationally intractable. 
- Using representative periods from time series aggregation helps tractability but has limitations: 
  (1) hyperparameter selection is ad hoc, 
  (2) uncertainty in selecting periods is ignored, 
  (3) assumption that more periods monotonically improve solutions is flawed.

Proposed Solution:
- A Bayesian optimization approach that efficiently searches the space of representative period clustering (RPC) hyperparameters to identify planning decisions that minimize out-of-sample costs.

- Formulates a two-stage stochastic CEP with first-stage capacity expansion decisions and second-stage operational decisions/costs.

- Solves tractable "surrogate" CEPs instantiated on representative day sets constructed by clustering supply-demand projection data.

- Learns to identify low-cost RPC hyperparameter configurations using Bayesian optimization to search the continuous hyperparameter space.

- Splits projections into train/validation/test sets. Uses validation set for BO iteration cost estimates to reduce bias.

Main Contributions:
- First application of BO to learn beneficial RPC hyperparameters for CEPs based on out-of-sample cost performance.

- Handles multiple supply-demand parameters and shows the importance of tuning their weights jointly.

- Demonstrates the approach on a joint power-gas capacity expansion case study, achieving ~3-4% cost savings over benchmarks.

- Shows more representative periods does not necessarily improve out-of-sample costs, motivating the need for this approach.

- Analysis highlights how tuned hyperparameters yield improved storage and renewable asset utilization through strategic positioning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization approach to efficiently search the space of representative period clustering hyperparameters in order to identify low-cost capacity expansion decisions for stochastic energy system planning problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a learning-assisted approach to efficiently solve large-scale stochastic capacity expansion problems. Specifically, the authors propose using Bayesian optimization to automatically tune the hyperparameters of a time series aggregation heuristic in order to construct reduced-order surrogate models of the full stochastic optimization problem. By searching over aggregation hyperparameters and evaluating resulting planning decisions on a validation set, their approach is able to identify lower-cost capacity expansion outcomes while remaining computationally tractable. The authors demonstrate this approach on a case study of joint power and natural gas infrastructure planning under uncertainty.

The paper focuses on developing a learning-assisted approach to solve large-scale, stochastic capacity expansion problems for energy systems planning. It leverages time series aggregation and representative period clustering to construct reduced-order surrogate models. Bayesian optimization is then used to efficiently search the space of clustering hyperparameters to identify planning decisions that minimize out-of-sample costs over multiple supply-demand projections. The approach is demonstrated on a case study of joint power and natural gas infrastructure planning for New England. Key terms reflect the stochastic optimization and machine learning techniques as well as the energy systems planning context.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1) Why is evaluating planning outcomes on held-out test data important for this problem setting? How significant of an issue is overfitting investments to the aggregated scenarios used in training the surrogate model?

2) The paper argues that picking representative periods should consider correlations between the different supply/demand parameters. However, Fig. 2 shows significant correlations between many of these parameters. Given these interdependencies, how should one reason about weighting the different parameters appropriately?  

3) How sensitive are the optimization results to the choice of kernel function for the Gaussian process model? Were any alternatives explored and how did they compare?

4) The acquisition function used for Bayesian optimization trades off exploration and exploitation. What impact did the choice of Î² have on the rate of convergence and quality of the final solutions discovered? 

5) The computational experiments initialize Bayesian optimization with 20 random points. What considerations go into picking a good number for random initialization? Could too few or too many points be detrimental?

6) How was the scenario dataset created in terms of its size and diversity? What potential issues could arise if the dataset does not capture an appropriately wide range of supply/demand patterns?

7) For problems with a larger number of aggregation hyperparameters, how well will the proposed approach scale given its reliance on solving mixed integer programs in the inner loop?

8) The operational costs evaluated on the validation set turn out to be lower than those on the test set. Is this purely a reflection of harder-to-meet projections existing in validation or indicative of another issue?

9) How does the performance of this method compare to simpler heuristic strategies for tuning the aggregation, such as grid search over hyperparameters? What are the key benefits of taking a Bayesian optimization approach?

10) If this method were to be deployed on other capacity expansion problem formulations, what adaptations may need to be made to ensure it is effective? How transferable is the overall approach?
