# [ActFormer: A GAN-based Transformer towards General Action-Conditioned 3D   Human Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07706)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question of this paper is how to generate realistic and diverse 3D human motions conditioned on semantic action labels, for both single-person actions and multi-person interactive actions. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) A GAN-based Transformer framework (ActFormer) can achieve superior performance in generating realistic and diverse action-conditioned human motions, by combining the representation power of Transformers and generative modeling capability of GANs.

2) Equipping ActFormer with a Gaussian Process latent prior can help enforce temporal correlations in the generated motions.

3) ActFormer can be extended to generate multi-person interactive motions by modeling temporal correlations and human interactions alternately with Transformer encoders.

4) ActFormer demonstrates strong adaptability to various human motion representations (e.g. joint coordinates, SMPL parameters) and different datasets of single-person and multi-person motions.

In summary, the central goal is to develop a powerful framework ActFormer for general action-conditioned human motion generation, and validate its effectiveness on both single-person and multi-person scenarios. The key hypothesis is that the proposed design can achieve superior generation performance across diverse motion data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting ActFormer, a GAN-based Transformer framework for general action-conditioned 3D human motion generation. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. ActFormer leverages the strong representation capability of Transformer and combines it with a Gaussian Process latent prior to generate high-quality single-person human motions for various action categories.

2. ActFormer is extended to handle multi-person interactive motions by alternatingly modeling temporal correlations and human interactions with Transformer encoders. This allows ActFormer to generate synchronized and natural-looking multi-person motions. 

3. A new synthetic dataset called GTA Combat is introduced to provide complex multi-person combat motion data, facilitating research on multi-person motion generation.

4. Extensive experiments show ActFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-person and multi-person motion generation across various datasets. The results demonstrate ActFormer's effectiveness for general human motion generation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing ActFormer as a powerful and flexible framework for generating diverse, realistic 3D human motions conditioned on action labels, for both single-person and multi-person scenarios.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes ActFormer, a GAN-based Transformer framework for general action-conditioned 3D human motion generation, including single-person actions and multi-person interactions; it achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks and motion representations and introduces a new synthetic multi-person combat dataset to facilitate further research.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of action-conditioned 3D human motion generation:

- This paper presents a significant advancement in generating diverse and high-quality motions for both single-person actions and multi-person interactions. Previous works have been limited to simpler datasets with fewer action categories and focused primarily on single-person motion generation.

- The ActFormer framework combines several key innovations to achieve strong performance:
  - Leverages a Gaussian Process latent prior to model inherent temporal correlations in motion sequences. This helps generate more realistic motions compared to autoregressive or independent latent priors used in previous works.
  - Uses a Transformer architecture that excels at modeling long-range dependencies in sequences. This captures the non-local correlations in human motions better than RNN/CNN-based generators used before.
  - Extends naturally to multi-person motions through alternating interaction and temporal modeling modules. Most prior works focus only on single-person motions.

- The results demonstrate superior performance over prior state-of-the-art methods like Action2Motion, ACTOR, and CSGN on large-scale benchmarks with complex data distributions (NTU RGB+D, BABEL). The ActFormer also shows better generalizability across motion representations.

- The paper makes a unique contribution through the new GTA Combat dataset for multi-person interactions. There is a lack of diverse MoCap data for complex multi-person motions, which this synthetic dataset helps mitigate.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in conditioned motion generation through technical innovations and evaluation on more challenging and comprehensive benchmarks. The results highlight the potential of the ActFormer framework to move towards a general human motion generation model applicable to a wide range of actions and motion representations. Multi-person motion generation is also an exciting new direction made possible by extending the ActFormer approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluate the ActFormer framework on more complex human-object interaction synthesis tasks. The current work focuses on single-person and multi-person actions without interacting with objects in the environment. Extending the framework to model human-object interactions could be an interesting future direction.

- Improve handling of separate interaction groups when generating motions for a large number of people (4 or 5). The current model does not have an explicit mechanism to divide people into separate groups with sparse interactions. This results in some failure cases as the interaction complexity increases. Developing methods to identify and model separate interaction groups could help address this issue.

- Explore alternative motion representations beyond joint coordinates and SMPL body model parameters. The authors demonstrate the framework works with different motion representations, but only evaluate on joint coordinates and SMPL. Evaluating on other motion representations (e.g. mesh vertices, implicit functions) could further demonstrate the generality.

- Apply the ActFormer for controllable motion generation and editing applications. For example, enabling control over style, content and other aspects of the generated motions via conditioning or interfaces. This could expand the usefulness of the framework beyond just unconditional generation.

- Improve sample efficiency and reduce the dependence on large-scale labeled motion capture datasets. The current data demand could limit applicability. Exploring ways to pre-train, leverage unlabeled data, use data augmentation, or generate synthetic data could help reduce the data needs.

In summary, the main future directions are extending the framework to more complex tasks like human-object interaction, improving multi-person modeling, evaluating on diverse motion representations, adding controllability, and reducing data demands. Advances in these areas could further demonstrate and enhance the generality of the ActFormer framework as a human motion generation model.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents ActFormer, a GAN-based Transformer framework for generating diverse, realistic 3D human motions conditioned on action labels. ActFormer can generate motions for both single person actions as well as multi-person interactive actions. The framework combines several key components: a Transformer architecture to model temporal correlations in motion sequences, a Gaussian Process latent vector sequence as input to provide inherent smoothness, and a GAN training scheme for high-quality generative modeling. For multi-person motions, ActFormer shares the same latent sequence among participants to synchronize them, while using separate positional encodings to distinguish different people. 

Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks including NTU RGB+D, BABEL, and a new synthetic combat dataset. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative results show ActFormer's ability to generate diverse, realistic motions adapted to various pose representations and for complex multi-person interactions. The work represents an important step towards developing a general human motion generator. Limitations include the inability to model separate interaction groups and a limitation on variable numbers of people due to the GAN training scheme. Overall, ActFormer shows promising capability and generalization for conditional motion generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes ActFormer, a GAN-based Transformer framework for general action-conditioned 3D human motion generation. The key components of ActFormer include a Transformer-based generator conditioned on Gaussian Process latent vectors and action labels, and a graph convolutional network discriminator. For single-person motion generation, the Transformer encoder models temporal correlations in the latent vector sequence. For multi-person motions, ActFormer employs a two-stage design by alternately applying self-attention among persons (I-Former) and then among time steps (T-Former). This allows ActFormer to effectively model both human interactions and temporal correlations in multi-person motions. Experiments show superior performance of ActFormer over prior arts on large-scale benchmarks with various motion representations. The framework demonstrates strong generalizability and takes an early step towards general human motion generation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper proposes ActFormer, a GAN-based Transformer framework for general action-conditioned 3D human motion generation, including both single-person and multi-person interactive motions. The key problems/questions it aims to address are:

- Prior works on action-conditioned motion generation have limitations in terms of scalability to more action categories, adaptability to different motion representations (e.g. SMPL vs skeleton), and capability of generating multi-person interactive motions. The paper explores a solution towards a more general human motion generator without these limitations.

- How to generate long, realistic and diverse human motion sequences conditioned on action labels? The paper proposes to combine a Transformer architecture with a Gaussian Process latent prior to address this challenge. 

- How to extend the framework to handle multi-person interactive motions? The paper proposes Interaction-Transformers and Temporal-Transformers to model human interactions and temporal correlations alternately in the multi-person setting.

- The lack of large-scale multi-person MoCap datasets is also a challenge for research on human motion generation. To facilitate this, the paper contributes a new synthetic dataset of complex multi-person combat motions collected from GTA-V game engine.

In summary, the key focus is on developing a scalable and flexible framework that can generate diverse, realistic 3D human motions from semantic action labels, for both single-person and multi-person cases, taking a step towards general human motion synthesis. The GAN-based Transformer architecture combined with the multi-person interaction modeling are the main technical contributions.
