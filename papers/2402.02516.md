# [Adaptive scheduling for adaptive sampling in POS taggers construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Managing large training data sets for machine learning models is expensive and time-consuming. Using a subset instead can reduce computational costs without sacrificing model performance, but determining the optimal subset size and selection strategy is challenging. 
- This is especially true for natural language processing tasks like part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which require complex models trained on expert-annotated data. More efficient sampling techniques are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an adaptive scheduling algorithm called COLTS for non-active adaptive sampling to reduce POS tagger training costs. 
- It calculates the smallest number of additional training instances needed at each step to ensure the next case improves model learning ability. 
- This adaptive approach is based on modeling the learning curve geometrically from a sequence of learning trends that iteratively approximate accuracy over time.
- The algorithm's step size and learning speed can be configured using a parameter called PORT (probability of relevant training).

Main Contributions:
- Proof of correctness of the COLTS algorithm with respect to formally stated working hypotheses. It provably provides the minimal spacing between cases that guarantees learning improvement.
- Introduction of a uniform testing framework and performance metrics to reliably compare sampling schedules for model accuracy, cost, and resources.
- Experimental results demonstrating COLTS has significantly higher learning cost savings than baseline geometric and arithmetic sampling schedules.
- Evidence it is robust to fluctuations in the learning curve and variations in the PORT parameter for configuring adaptive step size.

In summary, the paper presents an adaptively scheduled sampling technique and testing framework that reliably reduce POS tagger training costs without sacrificing model accuracy or robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an adaptive scheduling technique for non-active adaptive sampling in machine learning that calculates the optimal spacing between training instances to maximize learning efficiency, demonstrates its formal correctness, and evaluates it empirically on part-of-speech tagging, showing superior performance over other sampling methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an adaptive scheduling algorithm called COLTS (after COncavity LimiT Scheduling) for non-active adaptive sampling to reduce the training effort in generating ML-based POS taggers. Specifically:

- It formally proves the correctness of COLTS with respect to its working hypotheses, by providing the minimal spacing between consecutive training instances that ensures the next observation is relevant for learning. 

- It models the selection task geometrically by building a sequence of learning trends that iteratively approximate the learning curve. In each cycle, it calculates the next case from which the concavity hypothesis can no longer be guaranteed.

- It introduces a PORT (Probability of Relevant Training) parameter to configure the interaction between learning speed and sample size.

- It analyzes the robustness of COLTS against deviations from idealized assumptions by using mechanisms similar to those employed for stabilizing the halting condition.

- It evaluates COLTS on POS tagging, showing superior performance over baseline geometric and arithmetic sampling in terms of overall learning costs, while maintaining similarity in terms of resources used. The stability against temporary performance inflations and PORT variations is also analyzed.

In summary, it formally develops an adaptive scheduling technique for ML sampling and demonstrates its efficiency and reliability for POS tagging.
