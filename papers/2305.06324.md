# [Alternating Gradient Descent and Mixture-of-Experts for Integrated   Multimodal Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06324)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can we train a single transformer encoder model to effectively integrate and process inputs from diverse modalities (image, video, text, audio) by using a combination of techniques like alternating gradient descent (AGD) and mixture-of-experts (MoE)?The key hypothesis appears to be that by utilizing AGD and MoE in a single unified model architecture, it is possible to efficiently train the model on heterogeneous multimodal inputs and tasks without compromising performance compared to more complex multi-encoder designs. The authors aim to show that:1) AGD allows seamless integration and scaling to new tasks/datasets without redesigning the model. 2) Optimizing across diverse multimodal tasks with AGD is complementary and results in better model quality than training on individual tasks.3) MoE with shared experts for all modalities helps mitigate conflicts between modalities and bottlenecks compared to modality-specific components.4) Overall, the proposed techniques allow a simple and scalable approach to integrated multimodal perception, achieving strong performance on a variety of vision, text, and audio tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that AGD and MoE enable efficient training of a single model on multimodal and multi-task data, providing an effective and scalable solution for integrated multimodal perception. The paper presents experiments and results supporting this hypothesis.
