# [Siamese Content-based Search Engine for a More Transparent Skin and   Breast Cancer Diagnosis through Histological Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate diagnosis of skin and breast cancer is challenging for pathologists. Issues like inter-observer variability, over-diagnosis, over-treatment exist. 
- One key challenge is grading "Spitzoid Tumors of Uncertain Malignant Potential (STUMP)" in skin cancer. Their prognosis is unknown, making diagnosis difficult.
- Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) tools using Deep Learning can assist pathologists by providing a second opinion. However, most focus on classification while providing little insight into why a diagnosis was made. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Content-Based Histopathological Image Retrieval (CBHIR) system to retrieve highly similar patches to a query image, along with labels. This provides visual aid to pathologists for diagnosis.
- Use a custom Siamese neural network as feature extractor, trained with contrastive loss function. Enables learning from limited labeled histology images.
- Test approach on public breast cancer (BreaKHis) and private skin cancer datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Propose Breast-twins and Skin-twins CBHIR models for breast and skin cancer respectively, using Siamese networks. Show generalization ability across cancer types.
- Significantly improve state-of-the-art in retrieval accuracy, especially for top-1 retrieval which is most useful for pathologists. 
- First CBHIR approach to provide diagnostic aid for challenging STUMP cases by retrieving similar benign/malignant patches for comparison.
- Provide visual explanations using Grad-CAM for model retrievals to increase trust and transparency.
- Show high retrieval accuracy ensuring returned images are of the same cancer grade as queries, unlike classifiers which just predict labels.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in developing a CBHIR system using Siamese neural networks to provide visual diagnostic aid to pathologists and tackle key challenges like STUMP grading and model transparency in skin and breast cancer diagnosis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel content-based histopathological image retrieval approach using Siamese networks for breast and skin cancer diagnosis support, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in retrieving relevant patches even at top-1 retrieval.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing two Siamese networks for breast cancer (public data set) and skin cancer (private data set) to show the generalization of the proposed CBHIR technique. These proposed Siamese networks are robust to imbalanced data sets.

2. Using a Siamese network to address the shortcomings of histopathological images, including small inter-class variations and large intra-class variances. 

3. Reporting the CBHIR results on both data sets at the top first retrieved images to demonstrate the model's efficacy in retrieving relevant patches.

4. Providing a second opinion to pathologists to tackle the challenges in grading Spitzoid Tumors of Uncertain Malignant Potential (STUMP) cases by providing deep insights into the complexities. Showing Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) figures as explainable Skin-twins to provide interpretability.

5. Evaluating the performance of the proposed CBHIR technique in retrieving images with the same cancer type by comparison with state-of-the-art classifiers. 

6. Demonstrating that the proposed CBHIR framework, thanks to the Siamese network, outperforms other image retrieval methods based on experimental results on two histopathological data sets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What was the motivation behind proposing a Siamese network architecture for the feature extractor in the CBHIR system? How does it help address some of the key challenges with histopathology image analysis?

2. How exactly does the contrastive loss function used to train the Siamese network help improve the feature embeddings? What properties does it emphasize in the embeddings?  

3. The paper evaluates performance based on accuracy of the top-1 retrieval result. Why is this a more robust evaluation approach compared to checking accuracy at higher values of K? What are the limitations of evaluating at higher K values?

4. How does the Siamese architecture make the model more sample efficient compared to training an independent feature extractor? Why is this crucial for histopathology analysis where annotated dataset sizes are small?

5. For the skin cancer dataset, how does the proposed CBHIR approach help provide decision support for challenging Spitzoid Tumor cases? What additional interpretability is provided beyond just classification predictions?

6. What architectural modifications were required in going from Breast-twins to Skin-twins? How was the model adapted to account for larger image sizes in the skin cancer dataset?  

7. How do the Grad-CAM visualizations provide transparency into the model's decisions? What specific histopathological features is it identifying as being important?

8. The model seems to generalize well to unseen data as evidenced by the evaluation. What properties of the Siamese architecture promote such generalization capability?  

9. How do the CBHIR results compare with state-of-the-art classifiers applied on the same datasets? What advantages does CBHIR provide over just classifications?

10. What are some promising future research directions for improving CBHIR systems further? How can recent advances like federated learning and foundation models be incorporated?
