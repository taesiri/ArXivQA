# [Personalized Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Personalized   Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12149)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning across distributed devices without sharing their local data. However, standard FL can perform poorly when devices have non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data. 
- Over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) provides efficient learning by exploiting wireless broadcast for model aggregation, but requires careful communication resource management.
- Existing work on personalized FL and OTA-FL make simplifying assumptions about convexity or error-free channels.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a personalized OTA-FL framework using multi-task learning, assisted by a personalized reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for each device.
- A bi-level optimization problem is formulated with a global model trained across devices, and personalized models customized for each device's local data distribution.
- The PROAR-PFed algorithm adaptively controls uplink power, local computation (number of SGD steps), and RIS phase shifts to optimize global and personalized model training in a time-varying wireless environment.

Key Contributions:
- First work to study OTA-FL with per-device personalization and per-device RIS assistance for wireless channel control
- Cross-layer optimization co-designing communication and computation resources for both global and personalized learning tasks
- Convergence analysis for non-convex learning objectives under imperfect CSI
- Demonstrated superiority over benchmarks on non-i.i.d. FashionMNIST classification, especially for more personalized models

The key idea is joint communication-learning optimization to enable personalized over-the-air federated learning, with each device having its own RIS for favorable wireless propagation. Both theoretical convergence guarantees and experimental results on image classification verify the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes the first personalized over-the-air federated learning framework with assistance from personal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for each user, taking a cross-layer approach that adaptively optimizes communication and computation resources for global and personalized learning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the first personalized over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) framework with assistance from personal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for each user. Specifically, the paper:

1) Introduces a bi-level optimization formulation for personalized federated learning through multi-task learning, with objectives for both global and personalized tasks. 

2) Develops a cross-layer approach that jointly optimizes communication and computation resources for the global and personalized learning tasks over time-varying wireless channels with imperfect CSI. This includes adaptive designs for power control, local computation (training iterations), and RIS phase shift configurations.

3) Proposes the PROAR-PFed algorithm that implements this joint resource allocation strategy for personalized OTA-FL with personal RIS assistants.

4) Provides a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm under non-convex learning objectives. 

5) Demonstrates through simulations that PROAR-PFed outperforms existing methods on the Fashion-MNIST dataset under heterogeneous user data distributions.

In summary, the key contribution is the formulation and algorithm design for personalized OTA-FL with personal RIS, along with its convergence guarantees and demonstrated superiority over state-of-the-art approaches. The introduction of personal RIS is shown to be especially beneficial for handling user data heterogeneity.
