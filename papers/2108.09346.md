# [Pre-training for Ad-hoc Retrieval: Hyperlink is Also You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09346)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How to design effective pre-training objectives tailored for ad-hoc retrieval by leveraging the supervised signals from hyperlinks and anchor texts?

The key hypothesis is that:

Leveraging hyperlinks and anchor texts to construct pre-training objectives can provide more accurate and reliable supervised signals compared to existing methods, and better resemble the downstream ad-hoc retrieval task. This can help the pre-trained language model learn better query-document matching ability and further improve the ranking performance when fine-tuned on downstream retrieval tasks.

Specifically, the paper proposes four pre-training tasks based on hyperlinks to capture different views of anchor-document relevance:

1) Representative query prediction 
2) Query disambiguation modeling
3) Representative document prediction
4) Anchor co-occurrence modeling

By pre-training the Transformer model to predict pair-wise preferences on the constructed query-document pairs, the model can learn query-document matching from the anchor-document correlations. This provides a better initialization for fine-tuning on downstream ranking tasks compared to pre-training objectives not tailored for IR.

The central hypothesis is that introducing supervised signals from hyperlinks into pre-training objectives can boost the ranking performance when fine-tuned on ad-hoc retrieval tasks. Experiments on two datasets validate this hypothesis and show significant improvements over strong baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel pre-training framework called HARP (Pre-training objectives for ad-hoc Retrieval with Anchor texts and Hyperlinks) tailored for ad-hoc retrieval. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing to leverage the supervised signals brought by hyperlinks and anchor texts to design pre-training objectives for ad-hoc retrieval. This provides more accurate and reliable training data compared to existing methods like query likelihood sampling.

- Designing four pre-training tasks based on hyperlinks to capture anchor-document relevance from different perspectives:
  1) Representative query prediction
  2) Query disambiguation  
  3) Representative document prediction
  4) Anchor co-occurrence modeling

- Pre-training the Transformer model on large-scale pseudo query-document pairs constructed by the four pre-training tasks jointly with masked language modeling. This allows the model to learn query-document matching during pre-training.

- Conducting experiments on MS MARCO and TREC DL datasets. Results show that HARP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods including BERT and previous pre-training objectives tailored for IR. This demonstrates the effectiveness of introducing hyperlinks for pre-training in improving ad-hoc retrieval performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel pre-training framework that utilizes hyperlinks to generate high-quality training data and designs IR-oriented pre-training objectives to learn query-document matching, which leads to improved performance on ad-hoc retrieval tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel pre-training framework called HARP that leverages supervised signals from hyperlinks and anchor texts to design four pre-training tasks to learn query-document relevance matching, then fine-tunes the pre-trained model on downstream ad-hoc retrieval tasks and demonstrates improved performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of pre-training for information retrieval (IR):

- The main novelty of this paper is using hyperlinks and anchor texts for pre-training tailored to IR tasks. Most prior work on pre-training for IR uses objectives like inverse cloze task, predicting masked words, or sampling word sets as pseudo-queries. Leveraging anchor texts as a source of supervision is a unique approach.

- The idea of using anchor text as queries and target pages as relevant documents has been explored before in IR, but not for pre-training objectives. This paper is the first to design pre-training tasks around anchor-document pairs.

- The proposed pre-training approach HARP uses four novel objectives: representative query prediction, query disambiguation, representative document prediction, and anchor co-occurrence modeling. These capture different useful signals compared to prior pre-training tasks.

- Existing pre-training objectives like masked language modeling are more general. HARP focuses specifically on retrieving documents for queries, making it better suited for ad-hoc retrieval.

- The most related prior work is PROP, which also aims to pre-train for ad-hoc IR. But PROP samples pseudo-queries based on document words. HARP uses human-generated anchor text as queries instead.

- Experiments show HARP achieves new state-of-the-art results on MS MARCO and TREC DL, outperforming PROP and other baselines. This demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging anchor text for pre-training.

Overall, the use of anchor text provides a novel and effective source of supervision for pre-training tailored to IR. The proposed objectives are well-motivated to simulate query-document matching. This paper presents a unique pre-training approach with strong empirical results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring other types of data with natural supervised signals for IR-oriented pre-training. The authors used hyperlinks and anchor text from Wikipedia for pre-training. They suggest exploring using other types of naturally occurring data with relevance signals, such as query logs or product reviews. 

- Incorporating external knowledge into pre-training for retrieval. The authors suggest incorporating external knowledge bases or text corpora during pre-training could help the model better understand semantics for retrieval.

- Studying the transferability of pre-trained models on other IR tasks. The authors suggest analyzing if the pre-trained models can transfer well and improve performance on other information retrieval tasks besides ad-hoc document ranking, such as passage retrieval, question answering, etc.

- Exploring different neural architectures for pre-training and fine-tuning. The authors suggest studying if other neural network architectures like graph neural networks could be more suitable for modeling relevance in pre-training and fine-tuning stages.

- Analyzing the theoretical connections between pre-training and fine-tuning stages. The authors suggest theoretically analyzing why and how pre-training objectives tailored for IR can improve fine-tuning performance on downstream tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring other supervised pre-training data, incorporating external knowledge, transferring to other IR tasks, using different neural architectures, and analyzing the theoretical underpinnings. The authors provide good suggestions on how to build upon their work on pre-training for ad-hoc retrieval.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new pre-training framework called HARP for improving ad-hoc retrieval models. Ad-hoc retrieval refers to searching a collection of documents to find relevant results for a given query. The key idea of HARP is to leverage the semantic relationships between anchor texts and their destination pages in Wikipedia to create better pre-training objectives. 

Specifically, the authors design four pre-training tasks that treat anchor texts as pseudo-queries and destination pages as documents to model query-document relevance: 1) Representative query prediction, 2) Query disambiguation, 3) Representative document prediction, and 4) Anchor co-occurrence modeling. A Transformer model is pre-trained on these objectives jointly with masked language modeling. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on downstream ad-hoc retrieval datasets. Experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC DL datasets show that HARP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The results demonstrate that using anchor-document relationships as pre-training signals is an effective way to improve ranking models for ad-hoc retrieval.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel pre-training framework called HARP (pre-training objectives for ad-hoc retrieval with anchor texts and hyperlinks) for improving performance on ad-hoc retrieval tasks. The key idea is to leverage the correlations and supervised signals from hyperlinks and anchor texts to design better pre-training objectives tailored for information retrieval. Specifically, the authors devise four pre-training tasks based on hyperlinks to generate pseudo query-document pairs:

1) Representative query prediction: Treating anchor text as query and sampling context words to form query, while sampling words from destination page as negative query.

2) Query disambiguation: Treating ambiguous anchor text as query, and using context to select relevant destination page from candidates. 

3) Representative document prediction: Treating sentence with multiple anchor texts as query, and predicting more representative destination page.

4) Anchor co-occurrence modeling: Modeling similarity between co-occurring anchors in a sentence.

The Transformer model is pre-trained on these four objectives jointly with masked language modeling. After pre-training on Wikipedia, the model is fine-tuned on downstream ad-hoc retrieval datasets. Experiments show significant improvement over competitive baselines, proving the effectiveness of incorporating hyperlink signals into pre-training for retrieval.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are addressing is how to design effective pre-training objectives tailored for ad-hoc retrieval. Specifically:

- Existing pre-training methods for language models like BERT are not designed specifically for IR tasks like ad-hoc retrieval. They focus more on general language understanding. 

- Some recent work has proposed pre-training objectives tailored for IR, like using query likelihood sampling or representative word prediction. However, these methods rely on noisy signals like sampled pseudo queries.

- This paper proposes to leverage the anchor text and hyperlinks in documents as a source of high-quality training data. The key idea is that anchor text provides a natural form of "query" and its hyperlink target provides the relevant "document".

- The authors design 4 pre-training tasks based on mining anchor text pairs from documents: representative query prediction, query disambiguation, representative document prediction, and anchor co-occurrence modeling.

- They show combining these pre-training tasks with standard masked LM pre-training, and then fine-tuning on IR datasets, substantially improves retrieval performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, the key problem is designing pre-training objectives tailored for ad-hoc retrieval, rather than just general language representation. The novelty is using anchor texts and hyperlinks to create better training data for this goal.
