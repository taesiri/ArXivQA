# [GAvatar: Animatable 3D Gaussian Avatars with Implicit Mesh Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating highly realistic and animatable 3D avatars from text descriptions is very challenging. Traditional mesh-based methods have limited expressiveness to capture intricate avatar geometry. Neural radiance field (NeRF) methods are more flexible but inefficient for rendering high-resolution avatars. Recently Gaussian splatting was proposed as an efficient 3D scene representation, but its naive application to avatar generation fails to enable animation and leads to unstable training and geometry artifacts.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes GAvatar, a novel primitive-based implicit Gaussian representation for animatable avatar generation. Key ideas:

1) Attach Gaussians to pose-driven primitives to enable coherent animation. Gaussians transform along with primitive motion.

2) Use implicit neural fields to predict Gaussian attributes (color, opacity etc) based on canonical space coordinates. This stabilizes learning of millions of Gaussians and enables high-quality generation using noisy losses like SDS.

3) Propose SDF-based implicit mesh learning to regularize underlying geometry and extract high-quality textured avatar meshes from Gaussians. The SDF connects to Gaussian opacity via a kernel function.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel primitive-based implicit Gaussian representation for flexible and efficient modeling of animatable avatars. Enables extremely fast 100fps rendering at 1K resolution after optimization.  

2) Implicit Gaussian attribute field that stabilizes optimization of millions of parameters under high-variance losses like SDS.

3) SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach that regularizes geometry and extracts high-quality textured meshes from the Gaussian avatar representation.

The method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art avatar generation techniques like DreamHumans, TADA etc in terms of quality and efficiency. Both quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GAvatar method.
