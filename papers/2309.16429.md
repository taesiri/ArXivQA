# [Diverse and Aligned Audio-to-Video Generation via Text-to-Video Model   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16429)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate diverse and realistic videos that are aligned both globally and temporally with input audio samples? Specifically, the paper aims to develop a method that can take an audio sample as input and generate a corresponding video where:- Globally, the entire video is semantically associated with the audio sample (e.g. drums audio generates a video of someone playing the drums).- Temporally, each segment of the input audio is synchronized with the corresponding segment of the output video. So faster beats or changes in the audio align with motions/changes in the video.To achieve this, the paper utilizes an existing text-to-video model and learns a lightweight "adapter" to map audio representations to the text-based input expected by the text-to-video model. This allows leveraging the power of large pre-trained models while adding the desired audio conditioning.The method is validated on diverse datasets showing it can generate videos aligned to audio across a wide variety of semantic classes. A novel evaluation metric called AV-Align is proposed to specifically measure audio-video alignment over time. Comparisons to other methods demonstrate the approach generates higher quality and more aligned videos.In summary, the core research question is how to make use of audio cues to guide the generation of realistic, diverse videos that are synchronized with the audio both globally and locally in time. The proposed adapter method together with the new evaluation metric aim to advance progress in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. A new audio-to-video generation model that can generate diverse and realistic videos aligned with input audio samples, capturing both global semantics and local temporal correspondence between audio and video. 2. A lightweight adapter network that learns to map audio representations to text-based tokens compatible with pre-trained text-to-video models. This enables video generation conditioned on text, audio, or both text and audio jointly.3. A novel evaluation metric called AV-Align to measure the temporal alignment between input audio and generated video by detecting energy peaks in both modalities.4. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrating the model's ability to generate videos with high diversity, quality and audio-video alignment compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.5. Ablation studies analyzing the impact of different audio conditioning techniques like context windows and single vector conditioning.In summary, the key innovation is the lightweight adapter framework to map audio to text tokens for leveraging powerful pre-trained text-to-video models, along with the novel AV-Align metric to properly evaluate audio-video alignment. Together, these allow high quality and temporally aligned video generation from diverse audio inputs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a method for generating diverse and realistic videos that are aligned with input audio samples, by learning to map audio representations to pseudo text tokens that can condition a pre-trained text-to-video generative model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of audio-to-video generation:- The paper introduces a new method for generating diverse and realistic videos that are aligned with input audio samples, both semantically (globally) and temporally. This is an advance over prior work like Chatterjee et al. 2020 and Ge et al. 2022, which focused more on global alignment or specific scenes (e.g. talking heads). - The proposed method is novel in that it adapts a pretrained text-to-video model (ModelScope) by learning to map audio representations to text tokens. This enables conditioning on audio, text, or both. As far as I can tell, this is the first method to enable joint audio-text conditioning for video generation.- The paper validates the approach on three diverse datasets - VGGSound, Landscape, and AudioSet Drums. Results show improved alignment, quality, and diversity compared to prior art like TATS and MM-Diffusion. The human evaluation also shows preference for the proposed method.- A new evaluation metric called AV-Align is proposed to specifically measure audio-video temporal alignment by detecting energy peaks in both modalities. This is an important contribution since evaluation of fine-grained alignment has been lacking.- Limitations are fairly discussed related toaudio-video mismatches, granularity differences between modalities, and sequence length.In summary, the key advances are in enabling joint audio-text conditioning via adaptation of an existing model, generating more diverse and realistic videos aligned to audio, and proposing a new quantitative metric for measuring temporal alignment. The results overall represent a nice step forward for the field of controllable video generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the proposed method to generate longer video sequences. Currently the temporal conditioning is limited to 24 frames due to hardware limitations. The authors suggest extending to longer sequences may require hand-designed heuristics or heavy computation.- Exploring how additional modalities beyond audio and text could be incorporated, such as depth, images, or IMU data. The authors suggest these could be used jointly with audio and text as further conditioning inputs for video generation.- Addressing discrepancies that can arise between audio and visual modalities, especially in shorter video clips. The authors note that mismatch between audio and video is a general limitation of the domain.- Improving the mapping between audio and text latent spaces. Since these modalities operate at different levels of granularity, it is unclear if the current mapping holds all relevant information from the audio space.- Evaluating the method on additional datasets with longer, more complex videos to better assess the technique.- Exploring different network architectures and training strategies to improve video quality, diversity, and audio-video alignment.In summary, the main future directions relate to extending the approach to longer videos, incorporating additional modalities, handling audio-video mismatches, improving the audio-text mapping, evaluating on more complex datasets, and refining the model architecture and training. Overall the authors propose several interesting avenues to build on this work for audio-guided video generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a method for generating diverse and realistic videos that are aligned with input audio samples. The method utilizes a pre-trained text-to-video generation model (ModelScope) and a pre-trained audio encoder model (BEATs). It learns a lightweight "AudioMapper" module that maps audio representations to pseudo text tokens that can be fed into ModelScope. This allows video generation from audio alone, text alone, or both audio and text together. To capture both local and global audio context, the audio is divided into segments and context windows of varying sizes are used around each segment. The paper validates the approach on 3 datasets - VGGSound, AudioSet Drums, and Landscape. It outperforms prior work in both objective metrics and human evaluations of quality, diversity, and audio-video alignment. A new "AV-Align" metric is proposed to measure temporal audio-video alignment based on detecting energy peaks. Ablation studies show the importance of the multi-scale context windows. Overall, the method generates higher quality and more diverse videos that are better aligned to the input audio compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces a new method for generating diverse and realistic videos that are aligned with input audio samples, both globally and temporally. The key idea is to take an existing text-to-video generation model and adapt it to take audio as input instead of text. Specifically, the authors use a lightweight "adapter network" to map audio features extracted by a pretrained model into pseudo-text tokens that can be fed into the text-to-video model. To generate a video aligned with an input audio clip, the audio is first encoded into a sequence of feature vectors. These are mapped to pseudo-text tokens that incorporate both local and global audio context - shorter windows for local alignment and longer windows to capture the overall semantic content. The pseudo-text tokens are fed into the text-to-video model to generate each frame, conditioned on the relevant segment of audio tokens. This allows the model to generate videos with natural synchronization between visuals and audio. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on diverse datasets, and propose a new metric called AV-Align to quantitatively measure audio-video alignment. Comparisons to prior work show improved alignment, diversity and quality of generated videos.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a method for generating diverse and realistic videos that are aligned with input audio samples, both globally and temporally. The method utilizes a pre-trained text-to-video generation model (ModelScope) and a pre-trained audio encoder model (BEATs). The core of the proposed approach is a lightweight "AudioMapper" adapter network, which learns to map the audio-based representation from BEATs to the text-based input representation expected by ModelScope. Specifically, the audio is divided into segments, embedded using BEATs, and then mapped to pseudo-text tokens using the AudioMapper. To capture both local and global audio context around each video frame, the audio embeddings are aggregated using expanding temporal windows. The resulting text-token representations for each frame are then fed into ModelScope to generate the output video conditioned on the audio. The AudioMapper and an attentive pooling layer are trained end-to-end by optimizing the video reconstruction loss from ModelScope. This allows generating videos conditioned on audio alone, text alone, or both audio and text.
