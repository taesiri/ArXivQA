# [INSTRUCTEVAL: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Instruction-Tuned Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04757)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question or hypothesis is:

How can we conduct a more comprehensive, holistic evaluation of the capabilities of instruction-tuned large language models, in order to gain a deeper understanding of their potential? 

The authors note that despite the impressive capabilities shown by models like GPT-4, there is still a lack of systematic, rigorous assessment to truly understand their full abilities. This is due to factors like the black-box nature of many models, and the lack of multi-faceted evaluation studies. 

To address this gap, the paper introduces InstructEval, a new benchmark suite designed specifically to evaluate instruction-tuned LLMs in a more well-rounded way. InstructEval aims to assess models across three key dimensions:

1) Problem-solving abilities (through exams, reasoning tasks, etc) 

2) Writing capabilities 

3) Alignment with human values

By testing models in this comprehensive manner, spanning both objective metrics and more qualitative human judgments, the goal is to shed light on the factors that determine performance, and foster advancements in the capabilities of these AI systems.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that current evaluation practices are limited, and a more holistic methodology (as proposed through InstructEval) is needed to truly understand and advance instruction-tuned LLMs. The research questions surround how to design such a methodology, and what insights it will reveal about these models.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- More robust evaluation methods: The authors note the need for more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of instructed large language models to better understand their capabilities and limitations. They suggest exploring more robust benchmarks and test suites.

- Alignment with human values: The paper highlights the need to improve alignment of instructed models with human values like harmlessness and honesty. The authors suggest more research is needed in this area, including constructing better training datasets focused on human values.

- Multilingual and multimodal instruction tuning: The authors foresee extending instruction tuning evaluation to multilingual and multimodal settings as capabilities of models expand beyond just language.

- Scaling studies: The paper examines model scaling trends but suggests more analysis is needed on scaling model performance through more effective pretraining, instruction data, and training methods.

- In-context learning: The authors find limited and mixed impact of in-context demonstrations and suggest more research on when and how to effectively use demonstrations.

- Open challenges: The paper notes open challenges around model training transparency, mitigating risks, and monitoring societal impacts. More research is needed to address these issues.

In summary, the authors highlight needs for more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation, improving alignment with human values, extending instruction tuning to new modalities/languages, more effective scaling methods, optimizing in-context learning, and addressing open challenges around transparency, ethics and societal impact. Advancing research in these areas can lead to more capable and aligned instructed language models.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a new benchmark called InstructEval for evaluating instruction-tuned large language models. The key components of InstructEval are:

- Problem-Solving Evaluation: Models are evaluated on their ability to solve problems across diverse domains such as world knowledge, complex reasoning, arithmetic, programming, and causality using existing benchmarks like MMLU, DROP, and others.

- Writing Evaluation: Models are prompted to generate text across categories like informative, professional, argumentative, and creative writing. The quality of the generated text is judged automatically using rubrics and an evaluator model. 

- Alignment to Human Values: Models are evaluated on their understanding of human values like helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness using the HHH benchmark.

The authors evaluate over 10 major open-source instructed language models using the InstructEval benchmark. The results reveal the importance of high-quality instruction data for performance, the limitations of mimicking closed-source models, and gaps in problem-solving and alignment capabilities. InstructEval provides a more comprehensive assessment to gain deeper insights into instructed language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper appears to be addressing the challenges and need for more comprehensive evaluation of large language models that have been tuned through instructions (referred to as "instruction-tuned large language models"). 

The key problems/questions seem to be:

- Many recent instruction-tuned models like GPT-4 are closed-source black boxes, making it hard to deeply understand or evaluate their capabilities.

- There has been an overwhelming number of new open-source instruction-tuned models developed recently, but evaluation has not kept pace and claims about these models' abilities may be unreliable or exaggerated. 

- Evaluating instruction-tuned models is uniquely challenging because there are multiple factors that determine their performance, including pretraining, instruction data, and training methods. 

- These models have broad and expanding capabilities spanning language, reasoning, problem-solving etc. So evaluation needs to be holistic but this is difficult.

To address these challenges, the paper introduces a new comprehensive benchmark suite called InstructEval to evaluate the capabilities of instruction-tuned large language models in a more rigorous and holistic way.
