# [Beyond Positive Scaling: How Negation Impacts Scaling Trends of Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17311)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How does negation impact the scaling trends of language models?More specifically, the key questions investigated in this paper are:- Do language models exhibit straightforward positive scaling on questions with negation, as they do on many other tasks?- What different types of scaling trends (e.g. inverse, U-shaped, positive) can negation induce? - How do factors like model family, model size, and prompting method influence these scaling trends?- Can we explain the complex scaling trends through decomposing the negation question answering task into subtasks?The overarching hypothesis is that negation can lead to more nuanced and complex scaling trends compared to traditional positive scaling, and these trends can be explained by analyzing the scaling of the component skills needed for the task. The paper introduces the NeQA dataset and conducts experiments to test this hypothesis from different angles.In summary, the central research question is to understand and analyze the impact of negation on language model scaling trends, which is found to be quite complex and transitions between inverse, U-shaped and positive scaling based on model capabilities. The paper proposes task decomposition as a way to break down and explain these nuanced scaling behaviors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing NeQA, a question answering dataset containing negation, which reveals complex scaling trends of language models that shift from inverse to U-shaped to positive scaling. The paper also proposes a task decomposition analysis to explain these scaling trends by decomposing the task into question answering and negation understanding subtasks.Key points:- Introduces NeQA, a QA dataset with negation that exhibits inverse, U-shaped, or positive scaling trends depending on the model family and prompting method.- Conducts experiments on 4 model families with 3 prompting methods, revealing a gradation in scaling trends from inverse to U-shape to positive scaling.- Decomposes the task into question answering (linear positive scaling) and negation understanding (sigmoid scaling) subtasks. Combining the subtask scaling trends explains the overall scaling behavior. - Provides a unified perspective on inverse, U-shaped, and positive scaling trends through the lens of prompting methods, model families, and task decomposition.- Offers a way to analyze complex scaling trends of language models beyond straightforward positive scaling.In summary, the key contribution is introducing NeQA and task decomposition analysis to reveal and explain the nuanced scaling trends language models exhibit when processing negation. This provides new insights into developing language models' capabilities regarding negation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces a question answering dataset with negation (NeQA) that shows different scaling trends for large language models, including inverse, U-shaped, and positive scaling, and proposes a task decomposition analysis to explain these complex scaling trends in terms of the scaling trends of the component subtasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on language model scaling trends:- Focuses on a new phenomenon not previously studied - scaling trends on negation: This paper introduces the new dataset NeQA to specifically study how negation impacts language model scaling trends. Many prior works study scaling on standard datasets like GLUE, SuperGLUE, etc. Analyzing scaling on negation is novel.- Unifies different observed scaling trends: This work shows inverse, U-shaped, and positive scaling can all be observed on NeQA just by changing the model family or prompting method. It provides a unified picture of when each scaling trend occurs. In contrast, previous works study the trends in isolation.- Provides explanations via task decomposition: The authors propose a new analysis method of decomposing NeQA into two subtasks to explain the emergent scaling trends. This offers new insights compared to prior empirical scaling law studies without explainability.- Comprehensive study across diverse models: This paper evaluates various model families (GPT-3, Jurassic, Cohere) and prompting methods. Many other scaling papers focus on just one model family.- Implications for language model development: By identifying limitations of language models in understanding negation across scaling trends, the paper provides guidance for developing better language models. This practical impact is a key difference from pure empirical scaling studies.In summary, this paper makes several novel contributions to analyzing and explaining language model scaling trends, especially on the under-studied phenomenon of negation, which many models still struggle with. The comprehensive analysis provides both empirical insights and practical implications for improving language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the NeQA dataset to cover more comprehensive types of negation and text domains beyond the current sources of OBQA and LAMA. The authors note that the current dataset may miss some types of negation or domains.- Evaluating language models on handling negation in non-English languages and on multilingual models. The current work focuses only on English data.- Incorporating techniques to mitigate prompt sensitivity in language model evaluation. The authors acknowledge prompt sensitivity as a limitation and suggest techniques like those proposed in Burns et al. 2022 could help.- Applying the proposed task decomposition analysis to other tasks beyond NeQA. The authors suggest investigating whether similar decomposition approaches could explain scaling trends in more complex tasks.- Conducting more rigorous analysis to explain the emergent sigmoid-shaped scaling trends for the "negation understanding" subtask. The authors provide some intuition about this but suggest more rigorous future analysis.- Studying additional factors related to training that impact scaling, beyond just model size and prompting method. The authors simulate how attributes like negation ratio in training data and training compute impact scaling.- Developing better methods to improve language models' capabilities in processing negation, informed by the more comprehensive understanding of how scale and training factors influence negation.In summary, the key suggestions are to expand the negation dataset, apply the analysis to more tasks and languages, mitigate prompt sensitivity, explain the sigmoid subtask scaling, and leverage the insights to develop better techniques for handling negation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces NeQA, a new question answering dataset designed to evaluate language models' ability to process negation. The authors show that large language models do not exhibit straightforward positive scaling on NeQA, but rather inverse scaling, U-shaped scaling, or positive scaling depending on the prompting method and model family used. Stronger prompting methods or model families result in a transition from inverse to U-shaped to positive scaling. The authors explain this complex scaling trend through a task decomposition analysis, where NeQA consists of a question answering subtask with linear scaling and a negation understanding subtask with sigmoid scaling. The composition of these two scaling trends results in the final scaling observed. This analysis provides a new way to understand the nuanced scaling behaviors of language models. Overall, the work reveals that developing language models' capability for negation is a complex problem, and scaling trends are influenced by many factors like prompting methods, model families, and task compositions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces NeQA, a new question answering dataset designed to evaluate language models' ability to process negation. The authors construct NeQA by transforming questions from existing QA datasets to include negation. They evaluate different language models and prompting methods on NeQA and find the scaling trends vary - from inverse scaling to U-shaped to positive scaling as more powerful prompting or models are used. This demonstrates that language models do not exhibit straightforward positive scaling on negation understanding, suggesting it is a nuanced capability to develop. To explain the complex scaling trends, the authors propose decomposing the NeQA task into question answering (task 1) and negation understanding (task 2). Empirically, task 1 scales positively while task 2 scales sigmoidally with an emergent transition point. The transition point moves earlier with more powerful models/prompts. Combining the scaling trends of the subtasks yields the overall scaling shape. This analysis offers a way to understand complex task scaling trends and suggests developing negation understanding involves moving its transition point earlier via factors like model scale, training, and prompting. The work offers insights into analyzing and improving language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces NeQA, a question answering dataset containing negation, to study the scaling trends of large language models. The authors show that NeQA exhibits complex scaling trends - inverse, U-shaped, and positive scaling - depending on the model family and prompting method used. To explain these scaling trends, the authors propose decomposing NeQA into two subtasks: question answering (task 1) and negation understanding (task 2). Experiments show task 1 has linear positive scaling while task 2 has sigmoid-shaped scaling with an emergent transition point. The transition point shifts earlier with stronger prompting methods or model families. The authors explain that composing the scaling trends of the two subtasks yields the overall scaling trend of NeQA. Specifically, before the transition point in task 2, models don't understand negation so answer the same as the original question, causing inverse scaling. After the transition point, models understand negation so answer oppositely, causing positive scaling. The transition point determines whether the overall scaling is inverse, U-shaped, or positive.In summary, the key method is task decomposition analysis, which provides insights into complex scaling trends by studying the scaling trends of component subtasks and understanding how they combine to yield the overall scaling. This analysis reveals the nuanced effect of negation on language model scaling.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper seems to be addressing the following key questions:1. How does negation impact the scaling trends of language models? The paper introduces a new dataset called NeQA containing questions with negation to study this.2. What different types of scaling trends (positive, inverse, U-shaped) can language models exhibit on tasks with negation? The paper shows NeQA can demonstrate all three scaling trends depending on the model family and prompting method.3. Why do these different scaling trends occur? The paper proposes a task decomposition analysis, breaking down NeQA into a question answering subtask and a negation understanding subtask. The composition of scaling trends in these two subtasks explains the overall scaling shape.In summary, the main problem is understanding the effect of negation on language model scaling trends. The paper introduces a new benchmark and analysis methods to systematically study this problem. The findings reveal nuanced and complex scaling behaviors dependent on many factors like model size, training, and prompting.
