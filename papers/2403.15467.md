# [Don't be a Fool: Pooling Strategies in Offensive Language Detection from   User-Intended Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offensive language online is a growing issue, but malicious users find ways to evade filtering systems by adding typographical errors or character substitutions.  
- There has been limited exploration of such evasions in Korean language specifically, which has distinct features like characters being further subdivided.
- The paper terms such evasive tactics as "user-intended adversarial attacks" and categorizes them into: (1) Inserting meaningless strings/spaces/symbols (2) Copying the initial/middle/final sound of one Korean character to another (3) Decomposing a character into its constituent sounds.

Proposed Solution: 
- Instead of relying only on the final encoder layer's output, the paper utilizes "layer-wise pooling strategies" to selectively aggregate useful features from all layers.  
- Strategies introduced: Mean pooling, max pooling, weighted pooling, first-last pooling.
- These strategies leverage preceding layers' outputs too which focus more on token embeddings.
- Allows capturing both offensiveness (from later layers) and degree of textual attacks (from earlier layers).

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the evasive tactics as adversarial attacks grounded in real malicious behavior online.
- Introduces simple yet effective layer-wise pooling strategies to defend against these attacks without directly training them.
- Shows pooling strategies are robust even when attack rate is increased, achieving comparable performance to models trained on noisy texts.  
- Demonstrates importance of leveraging first and last layers rather than middle layers for detecting attacked offensive language.
- Establishes flexibility of pooling strategies - improves performance of both clean text models and noisy text models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes user-intended adversarial attacks on offensive language and layer-wise pooling strategies to defend against them without directly training on such patterns.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing user-intended adversarial attacks that are often associated with offensive language online from the perspective of malicious users. These attacks involve inserting special symbols or exploiting distinctive features of the Korean language.

2) Introducing simple yet effective pooling strategies in a layer-wise manner to defend against the proposed attacks. This allows selectively utilizing useful features from all layers rather than just the last layer to capture both offensiveness and token embeddings. 

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the layer-wise pooling strategies by assigning distinct weights to each layer and employing them depending on the nature of the pre-trained texts. The strategies are shown to be robust against increasing attack rates without directly training on the attack patterns.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing layer-wise pooling strategies to defend against user-intended adversarial attacks on offensive language, without needing to train on examples of those attacks. The key ideas are leveraging multiple layers to capture different types of features, and doing so in a way tailored to models pre-trained on clean vs. noisy text.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Offensive language detection
- User-intended adversarial attacks
- Insert, Copy, and Decompose attacks
- Pooling strategies
- Layer-wise pooling strategies
- Mean pooling
- Max pooling
- Weighted pooling  
- First-last pooling
- Performance degradation
- Korean language features
- Pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa)

The paper proposes user-intended adversarial attacks on offensive language, categorized into Insert, Copy, and Decompose attacks. It then introduces layer-wise pooling strategies like mean, max, weighted, and first-last pooling to defend against these attacks, applied to pre-trained BERT models. A key aspect is analyzing the performance degradation and robustness of models against the attacks. The attacks also exploit distinctive features of the Korean language.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes "user-intended adversarial attacks" that are grounded in prevalent forms found in offensive language online. What are some examples provided in the paper for the Insert, Copy, and Decompose attack types and how do they exploit features of the Korean language?

2. Why does the performance of existing models for offensive language detection decline as the rate of proposed attacks increases? What change occurs in the tokenization outputs when attacks are applied?

3. Explain in detail the four layer-wise pooling strategies introduced in the paper (Mean, Max, Weighted, First-Last). How do they differ and what is the motivation behind using information from multiple layers?

4. When evaluating on clean and attacked test sets, which layer-wise pooling strategy is most robust to the proposed attacks? Why does using only the last layer provide insufficient information? 

5. Describe the down-up and up-down pooling strategies that assign distinct weights to each layer. What underlying assumption do they make regarding which layers capture useful information?

6. Beyond pre-trained BERT models, the paper also applies pooling strategies to BERT models pre-trained on noisy texts and DeBERTaV3. How do the optimal strategies differ across these models and why?

7. For the model pre-trained on clean texts, analyze the performance degradation when attacks are introduced with and without first-last pooling. How does this compare to ensemble models?

8. Why is max pooling most effective for the BERT model pre-trained on noisy texts? In what ways does this model with max pooling outperform other strategies?

9. What differences are observed in the difficulty of defending against each attack type (Insert, Copy, Decompose)? Which is easiest and which is most challenging? Why?

10. What are some limitations of the current method? Can you think of any additional real-world adversarial attacks not covered? How might the strategies transfer to other languages?
