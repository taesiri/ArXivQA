# [Prioritized Semantic Learning for Zero-shot Instance Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing works on zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) use image-goal navigation (ImageNav) as a pretraining task. However, ImageNav can be solved without learning semantic information, resulting in agents with poor semantic perception ability. 
- Current ZSON evaluation only requires going to an object of the specified category, not a specific object instance. So it is unclear if agents can distinguish object instances.

Proposed Solution - Prioritized Semantic Learning (PSL):

1. PSL Agent Architecture
- Uses both a learnable ResNet encoder and a fixed CLIP encoder to obtain observation embeddings, ensuring it captures both navigation capacity and semantic information.  
- Proposes a Semantic Perception Module (SPM) to encode semantic differences between observation and goal for better understanding.

2. Prioritized Semantic Training Strategy  
- Selects more meaningful ImageNav goals using entropy minimization over predicted object categories. Reduces ambiguous goals like walls.
- Relaxes the perspective matching requirement in ImageNav reward to focus more on semantic matching.

3. Semantic Expansion Inference Scheme
- Maintains consistency between train and test goal embeddings using a support set to expand text goals with retrieved image embeddings.

Main Contributions:
- Reveals that ImageNav task does not necessarily require semantic learning, limiting performance on semantic-heavy tasks.
- Proposes PSL method to improve semantic perception for zero-shot instance navigation agents. Includes agent architecture, training strategy and inference scheme. 
- Extends zero-shot object navigation benchmark to zero-shot instance navigation task on HM3D using automatically generated text descriptions, requiring distinguishing object instances.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on both zero-shot object navigation and new zero-shot instance navigation tasks.
