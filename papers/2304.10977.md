# [Evaluating Transformer Language Models on Arithmetic Operations Using   Number Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10977)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent models like GPT-3 show impressive natural language abilities but struggle with tasks requiring reasoning, such as multi-digit arithmetic operations. Specifically, GPT-3 performs well on 2-3 digit additions/subtractions but accuracy drops significantly on 4-5 digit operations.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose "Calculon", a GPT-2 model fine-tuned to perform arithmetic operations using a pipeline that decomposes numbers into units, tens, hundreds, etc. before doing computations. This imitates how children learn arithmetic.

- They compare Calculon against baseline GPT-2 fine-tuned without decomposition, a "spaced" variant with digit spacing only, and GPT-3 with/without decomposition examples.

Key Results:
- Calculon substantially outperforms baseline GPT-2, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed decomposition pipeline for learning arithmetic reasoning. It achieves 72.85% on 5-digit additions compared to 0% for baseline.

- Calculon also outperforms the spaced variant, showing benefits beyond just improved digit tokenization.

- Providing GPT-3 decomposition examples actually hurts its few-shot performance, suggesting the approach is less suitable for few-shot priming.

- All models struggle with 2-digit multiplications, indicating higher reasoning may be needed.

Main Contributions:
- Showing transformer language models can learn to perform robust unseen arithmetic reasoning when trained with an explicit decomposition-based pipeline.

- Quantitative evaluation of the benefits of this pipeline over baselines.

- Evidence that arithmetic reasoning capabilities manifest differently in fine-tuned vs few-shot settings for large models like GPT-3.

In summary, the paper demonstrates and analyzes methods for improving arithmetic reasoning in language models to enable more robust numerical intelligence.
