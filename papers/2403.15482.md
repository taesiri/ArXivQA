# [Multi-Level Feedback Generation with Large Language Models for   Empowering Novice Peer Counselors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training peer counselors requires providing detailed feedback on their skills, but existing methods rely on costly human supervision and don't closely resemble how supervisors give feedback. 
- Prior automated methods provide mainly scoring or suggestion of responses, but lack natural language explanations tied to counseling goals.

Proposed Solution:
- Co-designed a novel multi-level feedback taxonomy with senior psychotherapy supervisors that structures feedback into: appropriateness checks, goal definitions, areas for improvement, and alternative goal-aligned responses.
- Constructed the FeedbackESConv dataset containing 400 emotional support conversations annotated with multi-level feedback by domain experts and GPT-4.  
- Developed a self-improvement method to enhance an LLM's ability to generate multi-level feedback. It uses the LLM's own scoring to create preference pairs for further alignment.  

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive feedback framework for peer counselor training that combines scoring, suggestions, and goal-oriented natural language explanations.
- Publicly available dataset of multi-level feedback annotated conversations to enable modeling.
- Demonstrated through expert evaluation that the self-improvement method boosts worst-case performance on feedback generation compared to baselines.
- Showed the enhanced LLM produces helpful feedback that approaches the quality of annotations by GPT-4 and domain experts.

In summary, the paper addresses the need for automated and comprehensive feedback for peer counselor training through a tailored taxonomy, dataset, and self-improving LLM method that minimizes the risk of unhelpful feedback generations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel multi-level feedback framework for training peer counseling skills that was co-designed with psychotherapy experts, constructs a dataset of emotional support conversations annotated with this feedback, and develops a method to generate such feedback using large language models enhanced via a self-improvement technique to minimize the risk of low-quality generations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel and comprehensive multi-level feedback framework for training peer counseling skills that was co-designed with senior psychotherapy supervisors. This feedback taxonomy spans different levels, from appropriateness checks to suggestions for improvements aligned with specific goals.

2. Constructing and publicly releasing a dataset called FeedbackESConv with 400 emotional support conversations annotated by domain experts and GPT-4 using the multi-level feedback taxonomy. 

3. Designing a self-improvement method on top of large language models to enhance the automatic generation of multi-level feedback. This method uses the model's own scoring to create preference pairs for further alignment. 

4. Demonstrating via quantitative and qualitative evaluation with domain experts that the proposed approach minimizes the risk of generating potentially harmful or low-quality feedback. The evaluations show the method significantly improves the worst-case performance on multi-level feedback generation compared to baselines.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) a novel feedback taxonomy, (2) a public dataset of annotated conversations, (3) a self-improvement method for feedback generation, and (4) evaluations showing improvements in worst-case performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multi-level feedback framework: A taxonomy for providing detailed, structured feedback to peer counselors, co-designed with senior psychotherapy supervisors. Includes components like appropriateness assessment, goal definition, areas for improvement, and suggested alternatives.

- Emotional support conversations: The counseling dialogues that were used as the basis for collecting feedback examples. The authors leveraged the public ESConv dataset.

- Model-in-the-loop annotation: A paradigm where the annotations are produced collaboratively between a model (GPT-4) and human experts. This co-annotation process was used to create the FeedbackESConv dataset.

- Self-improvement method: A technique introduced in the paper to enhance the quality and consistency of the feedback generation model, particularly for worst-case outputs. Relies on the model itself to score candidate generations and create preference pairs. 

- Direct preference optimization: An algorithm used along with the self-improvement method to fine-tune the model on the self-scored preference pairs. Helps align the model to its own preferences.

- Multi-level feedback generation: The main task focused on in the paper - using the fine-tuned model to automatically produce tailored, structured feedback for peer counselors based on conversation transcripts.

In summary, the key focus is on designing comprehensive feedback, collecting suitable data, and developing models for automatic multi-level feedback generation to empower novice peer counselors.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel multi-level feedback taxonomy for training peer counseling skills. Can you elaborate on the process and rationale behind co-designing this taxonomy with senior psychotherapy supervisors? What were some key insights gained?

2. The self-improvement method leverages the model's own scoring to create preference pairs for further alignment. Can you walk through the technical details of how this self-scoring mechanism works? What assumptions does this approach make?

3. The paper compares the self-improvement method against several baselines using automatic quality scoring. Why is minimizing worst-case performance critical in this domain? How does the worst-case performance compare between methods?

4. Qualitative analysis revealed the self-improvement method reduces certain errors like slight rephrasings that fail to resolve core issues. What types of errors does it appear most and least effective at resolving? 

5. The paper uses a model-in-the-loop co-annotation process between GPT-4 and experts. What were the practical challenges in coordinating this co-annotation workflow? How was consensus reached?

6. What considerations went into the hiring criteria and compensation for recruiting high-quality domain expert annotators? How was their expertise validated?

7. The self-improvement method relies on the model's own scoring to guide further training. What risks does this entail if the model's scoring is poor or biased? How was the reliability of the self-scoring evaluated?

8. What are some limitations of solely using a public emotional support conversations dataset for training and evaluation? How might performance differ on real peer counseling conversations?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on text-based conversations. What challenges arise in extending this feedback approach to other modalities like voice or video?

10. What steps were taken regarding ethics, consent, and responsible disclosure? How can risks related to quality and bias in automated feedback systems be monitored if deployed?
