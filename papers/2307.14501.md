# [Improving Reliable Navigation under Uncertainty via Predictions Informed   by Non-Local Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14501)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of reliable long-horizon goal-directed navigation in partially mapped environments. Specifically, making good navigation decisions often requires using non-locally available information from across the parts of the environment the robot has already observed. Many existing approaches are limited in their ability to utilize such non-local information.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an approach that extends the Learning over Subgoals Planner (LSP) by replacing its neural network with a Graph Neural Network (GNN). This allows the planner to make predictions about unseen parts of the environment using both local and non-local observable information. The environment map is converted into a graph representation that preserves topological structure and long-range dependencies. The GNN takes this graph as input to predict properties of subgoals (parts of the unseen environment behind frontiers/boundaries). These predictions inform planning decisions over a longer time horizon.

Key Contributions:
- Converts partial environment maps to graph representations that maintain topological structure and long-range dependencies, unlike the limited local views used in prior LSP approaches
- Employs a Graph Neural Network architecture that can utilize both local and non-local observable information to make better predictions about properties of unseen space  
- Integrates GNN predictions into the LSP planning framework to enable more informed long-horizon planning while retaining guarantees on plan completeness/reliability
- Demonstrates substantially improved navigation performance in complex simulated environments where non-local information use is key, reducing costs by 9.3-14.9% over baselines

The approach contributes more reliable, efficient navigation in partially known environments by equipping the robot with the ability to exploit non-local information relevant to planning decisions. The integration of learning and planning retains reliability guarantees unavailable in many end-to-end learned approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a reliable model-based navigation approach that uses a graph neural network to estimate the goodness of long-horizon goal-directed actions from both local and non-local map information, improving performance in partially known environments where non-local knowledge is essential.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an approach for improving reliable, long-horizon, goal-directed navigation in partially-mapped environments. Specifically:

- They present an approach that uses non-locally available information to make predictions about the goodness of temporally-extended actions that enter unseen space. This allows the robot to make more informed decisions about where to navigate next.

- They build on the recent Learning over Subgoals Planning (LSP) approach for planning under uncertainty. Their method retains LSP's reliability guarantees (the robot is guaranteed to reach the goal if a viable path exists).

- They use a graph neural network (GNN) to make predictions about unseen space using both local and non-local information. The GNN operates on a graph representation of the partial map.

- They demonstrate improved navigation performance in 3 simulated environments where non-local information is needed to perform well, including a large-scale university building environment generated from real floorplans. For example, they show a 9.3% cost reduction compared to a non-learned baseline in the university environment.

In summary, the key contribution is a reliable, learning-based navigation approach that leverages non-local information via a graph neural network to make better predictions and decisions for goal-directed navigation in partial maps. The approach improves performance while retaining guarantees on reliability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the graph representation of the environment capture both topological structure and allow information to be retained and communicated over long distances? What are the specific steps involved in generating this graph representation?

2. What are node features in the graph representation and what key information do they encode to allow the Graph Neural Network (GNN) to make accurate predictions?

3. Why can't a fully connected neural network be used instead of a GNN to make predictions? What are the key advantages of using a GNN architecture in this navigation task?

4. Explain the loss function used to train the GNN. Why is a weighted cross-entropy loss used for the $P_S$ term and an L1 loss used for the $R_S$ and $R_E$ terms? 

5. What is the Learning Over Subgoals Planning (LSP) abstraction and how does it alleviate the computational requirements of POMDP planning? What are the key terms involved in the LSP planning equation?

6. In the J-Intersection environment, what systematic policies fail? Why does the GNN approach always correctly decide which way to go at the intersection?

7. In the Parallel Hallway environment, what relational information must be learned for the robot to navigate well? Why can't the colors be entirely random?

8. How many graph convolution and locally fully connected layers are in the GNN architecture? What are the advantages of having both types of layers?  

9. What safety guarantees does the LSP planning abstraction provide during navigation? Why is the approach reliable by design?

10. What future work directions are discussed to further improve the approach? What additional sensory inputs could inform the goodness predictions of actions?
