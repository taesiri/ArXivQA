# [Three-Filters-to-Normal+: Revisiting Discontinuity Discrimination in   Depth-to-Normal Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07964)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Three-Filters-to-Normal+ (3F2N+), an enhanced surface normal estimation algorithm that effectively handles depth discontinuities. A novel discontinuity discrimination module (DDM) is proposed that combines depth curvature minimization and correlation coefficient maximization through conditional random fields to quantify discontinuity levels. This allows 3F2N+ to distinguish discontinuities and optimize surface normal estimates near discontinuous regions. To evaluate robustness, the authors created a large-scale synthetic dataset with 20K clean and noisy depth images across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from 3F2N+, with average angular errors of 7.85° on clean indoor data and 11.98° on noisy outdoor data. Additional experiments highlight benefits in downstream tasks including freespace detection, 6D pose estimation, and point cloud completion when incorporating the high-quality normals from 3F2N+. The method and datasets enable further research into enhanced geometry-based surface normal estimation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It introduces a novel discontinuity discrimination module (DDM) that combines depth curvature minimization and correlation coefficient maximization through conditional random fields (CRFs) to improve surface normal estimation, especially near or on discontinuous regions. 

2. It creates a large-scale synthetic surface normal (SSN) dataset with 20,000 depth images containing both clean and noisy data to evaluate the robustness of surface normal estimators on realistic sensor noise. The dataset has 10 indoor and 10 outdoor scenarios.

3. It proposes an enhanced surface normal estimator called 3F2N+ that integrates the proposed DDM module. Experiments show 3F2N+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the existing 3F2N dataset and the new SSN dataset, with average angular errors of 0.93°, 4.07° and 9.98° on the 3F2N dataset.

4. It demonstrates the versatility of 3F2N+ on three downstream applications - freespace detection, 6D pose estimation and point cloud completion. Incorporating 3F2N+ consistently improves the performance of baseline methods on these tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed DDM module and 3F2N+ surface normal estimator that effectively handles discontinuities and sets new state-of-the-art results, as demonstrated on multiple datasets and applications. The new SSN dataset is also a valuable contribution for benchmarking surface normal estimators.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing surface normal estimators (SNEs) face challenges in accurately estimating surface normals near or on discontinuous regions in depth images/point clouds. This is due to noise and other variations in raw sensor data. Additionally, real-world datasets lack accurate surface normal ground truth for evaluation.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new SNE called "Three-Filters-to-Normal+" (3F2N+) which enhances their previous work 3F2N by improving discontinuity discrimination. Two novel techniques are introduced - depth curvature minimization and correlation coefficient maximization - to quantify the extent of discontinuities. These are integrated into a discontinuity discrimination module (DDM) which optimizes surface normal estimation using conditional random fields (CRFs).

Additionally, a large-scale synthetic surface normal (SSN) dataset is introduced containing 20K depth images with surface normal ground truth. It has indoor and outdoor scenarios, with and without Gaussian noise, to evaluate robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Explored using depth curvature and correlation coefficient to measure discontinuity levels
- Proposed discontinuity discrimination module (DDM) that incorporates extent measures into CRF feature functions to distinguish discontinuities
- Introduced SSN dataset with clean and noisy depth images for comprehensive SNE evaluation
- 3F2N+ integrated with DDM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while ensuring real-time performance
- Demonstrated 3F2N+ improves performance in downstream applications like freespace detection, 6D pose estimation and point cloud completion

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards enhancing surface normal estimation on discontinuous regions by proposing the DDM technique and SSN dataset. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of 3F2N+ integrated with DDM across various datasets.
