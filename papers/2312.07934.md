# [Toward Real World Stereo Image Super-Resolution via Hybrid Degradation   Model and Discriminator for Implied Stereo Image Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07934)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for real-world stereo image super-resolution that enhances image quality while preserving disparity consistency. A key contribution is the development of a stereo image discriminator that implicitly captures disparity information to compel the generator to produce high-quality images without introducing disparity shifts. Additionally, a hybrid degradation model with three stages is introduced to simulate complex real-world degradations of stereo images more effectively. This includes modeling differences in noise and blur across the left and right images. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real stereo image datasets. On the Flickr1024RS dataset, the method reduces the disparity error by 0.8 compared to prior arts while improving perceptual quality. Further ablation studies analyze the impact of different degradation strategies and discriminator designs. The effectiveness of both the proposed implicit discriminator and hybrid degradation model are validated. Future work involves transferring knowledge from mature single-image super-resolution models and exploring more universal stereo degradation models.
