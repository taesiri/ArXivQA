# [An epistemic logic for modeling decisions in the context of incomplete   knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11186)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decisions are inherently epistemic, i.e. they depend on the knowledge state of the decision maker. However, existing decision modeling formalisms like Decision Model and Notation (DMN) and approaches from Decision Theory do not have constructs to model the epistemic nature of decisions.
- This leads to a semantics mismatch when decisions need to be made under uncertainty, i.e. with incomplete knowledge. For example, it is not possible in DMN to express that a certain decision should be made if some fact is not known.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new language called Epistemic DMN (EDMN) which extends DMN with epistemic operators that allow expressing that some fact is known or not known.
- Provide a translational semantics for EDMN into Ordered Epistemic Logic (OEL), an existing epistemic logic with stratified theories. 
- Identify a syntactic fragment of OEL called Epistemic Body Definitions (EBD) which is suitable for modeling decisions, guarantees uniqueness of decision outcomes and aligns with the EDMN translation.
- Implement an OEL reasoner with EDMN frontend to demonstrate feasibility.

Main Contributions:
- Proof that OEL can represent DMN decisions and optimization approaches from Decision Theory
- Introduction of language EDMN extending DMN with epistemic operators
- Translational semantics of EDMN into OEL 
- Proof that EDMN can represent DMN and Decision Theory approaches
- Identification of EBD fragment of OEL for modeling decisions
- Implementation of OEL reasoner and EDMN frontend

In summary, the paper argues that decisions are inherently epistemic and provides a solution in the form of a new epistemic language EDMN with a formal semantics grounded in epistemic logic. The implementation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using Ordered Epistemic Logic as a knowledge representation language to formally model and reason about decisions under uncertainty, by stratifying epistemic theories into environment and decision components connected through inductive definitions with epistemic bodies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing a new language called Epistemic Decision Model and Notation (EDMN) which extends the existing Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard with epistemic operators to allow modeling decisions under uncertainty/incomplete knowledge. 

2. Providing a translation from EDMN to Ordered Epistemic Logic (OEL), leveraging OEL's ability to stratify knowledge and represent epistemic states. This enables EDMN decision models to be executed using OEL reasoners.

3. Identifying a syntactic fragment of OEL called Epistemic Body Definitions (EBD) which is well-suited for modeling decisions, and proves that EBD guarantees uniqueness of decisions.

4. Implementing an OEL reasoner and EDMN-to-OEL translator to demonstrate feasibility of the approach.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the new EDMN language and semantics to address the limitation of existing decision modeling formalisms in dealing with incomplete knowledge, by building on top of the expressiveness of epistemic logics. The translation to OEL and implementation aim to prove out this approach.

The paper discusses using epistemic logic and Ordered Epistemic Logic (OEL) specifically to model decisions, especially in contexts of uncertainty/incomplete knowledge. It proposes an "epistemic DMN" extension and fragment of OEL for decision modeling. The key goal is to resolve issues like semantic mismatch, lack of semantic clarity, and poor elaboration tolerance that arise when modeling decisions under uncertainty in existing formalisms like standard DMN and decision theory.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that existing decision modeling formalisms like Decision Theory and DMN lack the ability to express decisions properly in contexts of incomplete knowledge. Can you elaborate on the key limitations of these existing formalisms in modeling epistemic decisions? 

2. The concept of an "epistemic decision function" is introduced which maps epistemic states to decisions. What are the key properties of this proposed mapping that makes it more suitable to model decisions under uncertainty compared to existing formalisms?

3. Ordered Epistemic Logic (OEL) is proposed as a suitable language for modeling epistemic decisions. Can you explain the key syntactic and semantic aspects of OEL that enables it to represent arbitrary epistemic decision functions? 

4. The paper defines a translation from DMN decision tables to OEL theories. What is the intuition behind this translation and how does it provide DMN with epistemic semantics? What are the practical implications?

5. Epistemic DMN (EDMN) is introduced as an extension of DMN for modeling decisions under uncertainty. What are the key new syntactic constructs added in EDMN and how do they expand the expressiveness of standard DMN?

6. The concept of "Epistemic Body Definitions" is introduced as a particular syntactic fragment of OEL for decision modeling. What is the motivation behind identifying this fragment and what are its key properties?

7. Can you walk through the "Interview Example" presented in the paper and analyze how the epistemic constructs in EDMN allow clear and elaboration-tolerant modeling of this decision problem?

8. The OEL reasoner and EDMN translator implemented in this paper enables new forms of automated reasoning on decision models. Can you suggest some potential new reasoning tasks that this system now enables?

9. How does the stratified, non-self referential nature of OEL differentiate it from other non-monotonic logics like autoepistemic logic and default logic? Why does this make OEL more suitable as an epistemic decision modeling language?

10. The paper claims the approach addresses various issues like semantic clarity, semantic mismatch and elaboration tolerance in modeling decisions under uncertainty. Can you substantiate these claims by concrete examples and comparisons?
