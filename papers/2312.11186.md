# [An epistemic logic for modeling decisions in the context of incomplete   knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11186)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decisions are inherently epistemic, i.e. they depend on the knowledge state of the decision maker. However, existing decision modeling formalisms like Decision Model and Notation (DMN) and approaches from Decision Theory do not have constructs to model the epistemic nature of decisions.
- This leads to a semantics mismatch when decisions need to be made under uncertainty, i.e. with incomplete knowledge. For example, it is not possible in DMN to express that a certain decision should be made if some fact is not known.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new language called Epistemic DMN (EDMN) which extends DMN with epistemic operators that allow expressing that some fact is known or not known.
- Provide a translational semantics for EDMN into Ordered Epistemic Logic (OEL), an existing epistemic logic with stratified theories. 
- Identify a syntactic fragment of OEL called Epistemic Body Definitions (EBD) which is suitable for modeling decisions, guarantees uniqueness of decision outcomes and aligns with the EDMN translation.
- Implement an OEL reasoner with EDMN frontend to demonstrate feasibility.

Main Contributions:
- Proof that OEL can represent DMN decisions and optimization approaches from Decision Theory
- Introduction of language EDMN extending DMN with epistemic operators
- Translational semantics of EDMN into OEL 
- Proof that EDMN can represent DMN and Decision Theory approaches
- Identification of EBD fragment of OEL for modeling decisions
- Implementation of OEL reasoner and EDMN frontend

In summary, the paper argues that decisions are inherently epistemic and provides a solution in the form of a new epistemic language EDMN with a formal semantics grounded in epistemic logic. The implementation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.
