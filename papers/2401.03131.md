# [A Physics-guided Generative AI Toolkit for Geophysical Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Full-waveform inversion (FWI) plays a vital role in geoscience for imaging the subsurface, but suffers from high computational cost and unsatisfactory performance with physics-based methods. 
- Data-driven machine learning (ML) methods have emerged to improve accuracy and efficiency, but struggle with "unprivileged data", which is common in geoscience applications.
- ML models also need to be pruned for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, but pruning significantly degrades performance on unprivileged data.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose EdGeo, a physics-guided generative toolkit to generate high-fidelity velocity maps and corresponding seismic data.
- It uses a conditioned diffusion model to generate velocity maps, guided by physics principles like the acoustic wave equation.
- A leakage movement module moves leakages to shallower layers to simulate unprivileged data. 
- A distribution alignment module aligns deeper layer distributions to shallower ones.
- The generated data is used to fine-tune pruned ML models to improve performance on unprivileged data.

Key Contributions:
- Novel method to generate high-quality unprivileged geophysical data by combining generative AI with physics guidance.
- Framework tailored for resource-constrained edge devices via model pruning and fine-tuning.
- Significantly boosts performance of pruned ML models on unprivileged data in terms of SSIM, MSE and MAE.
- Enables accurate prediction of shale-layer CO2 leakages that other methods fail to detect.
- Pushes frontiers of accuracy vs. latency trade-off for real-time subsurface monitoring.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of generative AI and physics knowledge to produce unprivileged training data to improve ML model localization and performance for geoscience monitoring applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes EdGeo, a physics-guided generative AI toolkit to generate high-fidelity velocity maps and corresponding seismic data to fine-tune pruned machine learning models for improved subsurface imaging, especially for representing unprivileged features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the EdGeo toolkit, which incorporates physics-guided optimization to facilitate the generation of high-quality data for scenarios where data is unprivileged or underrepresented. Specifically, EdGeo:

- Employs a conditional diffusion model and techniques like leakage movement and distribution alignment to generate unprivileged data representing subsurface velocity maps with CO2 leakage occurring in shallow layers. 

- Uses physics-based acoustic wave equations to generate corresponding synthetic seismic data paired with the generated velocity maps.

- Enables effective fine-tuning of pruned machine learning models on this generated unprivileged data to improve their ability to predict shallow CO2 leakages while meeting real-time latency constraints. 

- Demonstrates through experiments that models fine-tuned on EdGeo generated data achieve superior performance in terms of metrics like SSIM, MSE, and MAE compared to other generative models, especially in predicting leakages occurring in shallow layers.

In summary, EdGeo facilitates the generation of high-fidelity unprivileged data tailored to geoscience applications and model fine-tuning to address the problem of localization and real-time subsurface monitoring.
