# [Instruction-tuned Language Models are Better Knowledge Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12847)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can store a lot of factual knowledge gained through pre-training. However, this knowledge can become outdated over time. A common approach is to continue pre-training LLMs on new documents to update their knowledge. 
- The paper finds that while continued pre-training reduces the perplexity (uncertainty) of new documents, LLMs still struggle to correctly answer questions about those documents. This is referred to as the "perplexity curse".

Proposed Solution: 
- The key insight is that question-answer (QA) pairs directly show how knowledge needs to be accessed, while documents weave factual statements together in more complex ways.
- The paper proposes "pre-instruction tuning" (\pit): first train the LLM exclusively on QA pairs to learn patterns of knowledge access, before training on a mix of those QA pairs and associated documents to align knowledge encoding.

Key Results:
- \pit outperforms standard continued pre-training followed by instruction tuning by 17.8\% in answering questions about updated documents.
- Detailed ablation studies confirm the importance of prioritizing learning QA pairs over documents.
- \pit enhances knowledge acquisition even when documents are from a different domain than the QA pairs.
- When applied to real-world data, \pit continues to show gains over baselines.

Main Contributions:
- Identifying "perplexity curse" limitation when updating LLMs with new documents 
- Proposing and validating "pre-instruction tuning" (\pit) as a solution
- Showing \pit works by prioritizing learning knowledge access patterns
- Demonstrating generalization of \pit to new domains


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes pre-instruction-tuning, a method that first trains large language models on question-answer pairs to learn how knowledge is accessed before continuing pre-training on documents to enhance their ability to absorb factual knowledge from complex texts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called pre-instruction-tuning (PIT) for improving the ability of large language models (LLMs) to absorb knowledge from documents during continued pre-training. Specifically:

- The paper first conducts extensive experiments to analyze the limits of standard continued pre-training followed by instruction-tuning (IT) in eliciting knowledge from LLMs. It finds that while this standard approach is useful, the amount of elicited knowledge is still limited, a phenomenon the authors refer to as the "perplexity curse". 

- To mitigate the perplexity curse, the paper proposes pre-instruction-tuning (PIT), which exposes the LLM to question-answer (QA) pairs before continued pre-training on documents. The intuition is that QA pairs demonstrate how knowledge will be accessed, which aids absorbing knowledge from complex documents.

- The paper studies different variants of PIT and finds that prioritizing learning to access knowledge over learning to encode knowledge from documents is key. This leads to an improved method called PIT++.

- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PIT++ significantly outperforms standard IT, improving QA accuracies by 17.8% on Llama-2 7B and 16.3% on Llama-2 70B. The method also shows cross-domain generalization.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing PIT, an effective method for enhancing the ability of LLMs to continually acquire knowledge from documents.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Continued pre-training 
- Instruction tuning
- Knowledge acquisition
- Question answering (QA)
- Perplexity curse
- Pre-instruction tuning (PIT)
- Wiki2023 dataset

The paper focuses on improving the ability of large language models to continually acquire factual knowledge from new documents through continued pre-training and instruction tuning approaches. Key methods examined include standard fine-tuning (FT) versus pre-instruction tuning (PIT), which exposes the model to QA data before continued pre-training on documents. Experiments are conducted using the Wiki2023 dataset built from recent Wikipedia articles to assess knowledge acquisition. The perplexity curse refers to limited knowledge elicitation even when document perplexity is minimized. Overall, the paper demonstrates PIT significantly enhances the capacity of LLMs to absorb knowledge compared to standard FT.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) How does the proposed pre-instruction tuning (PIT) method specifically help large language models become better at absorbing and retaining knowledge from documents compared to standard instruction tuning? 

2) What motivated the idea behind exposing language models to question-answer pairs before continued pre-training on documents in the PIT method?

3) What were the key findings from the ablation studies on different arrangements of QA pairs and documents that led to the proposed improved PIT++ method?

4) Why does the order of training matter in the PIT method - why is it better to prioritize learning to access knowledge via QA pairs first before encoding knowledge from documents?

5) How does the PIT method help mitigate the "perplexity curse" phenomenon observed in the experiments - where minimized document perplexity does not directly translate to better QA performance?

6) What explanations are provided in the paper for why the PIT method is effective in improving knowledge retention from documents?

7) How does the paper analyze the training dynamics during continued pre-training to shed light on model overfitting and generalization behavior regarding knowledge retention?

8) What open questions remain regarding scaling up the PIT method to even broader sets of document types and instruction tuning objectives? 

9) What are the limitations of the Wiki2023 dataset used in the experiments and how could future work address those limitations through different data?

10) How do the parametric knowledge retention results with PIT compare quantitatively and qualitatively to retrieval augmented approaches? What are the tradeoffs?
