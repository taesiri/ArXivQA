# [LLM-Blender: Ensembling Large Language Models with Pairwise Ranking and   Generative Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02561)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we ensemble multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) in an effective way to achieve consistently superior performance across diverse natural language generation (NLG) tasks?The key hypotheses that the paper explores are:1) Different LLMs have diverse strengths and weaknesses, so intelligently combining their outputs could lead to better overall performance than relying on any single LLM.2) A specialized pairwise ranking model called PairReranker can more effectively discern subtle differences between candidate outputs compared to prior individual scoring methods.3) Further fusing the top-ranked candidates using a generative model called GenFuser can produce even better results by capitalizing on the strengths of the selected outputs. 4) The proposed framework, LLM-Blender, which integrates PairReranker and GenFuser, will significantly boost the performance of an ensemble of open-source LLMs across various metrics and tasks.So in summary, the paper introduces a novel approach for ensembling multiple LLMs in a way that taps into their complementary capabilities, with the goal of achieving superior and more robust performance on NLG tasks. The core research questions revolve around evaluating the proposed ranking, selection and fusion techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called LLM-Blender for ensembling multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) in order to improve their robustness, generalization and accuracy. The key ideas are:1) Introducing a specialized pairwise comparison method called PairRanker to discern subtle differences between candidate outputs and effectively rank them. This helps select the best LLM for each example.2) Proposing a generative fusion module called GenFuser that merges the top-ranked candidates to produce an improved final output by capitalizing on their complementary strengths. 3) Creating a new benchmark dataset called MixInstruct for training and evaluating LLM ensembling techniques in the context of instruction-following tasks.4) Comprehensive empirical evaluation shows the proposed LLM-Blender framework significantly outperforms individual LLMs and baseline ensembling methods by effectively combining their unique contributions.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel and effective pipeline to ensemble multiple LLMs in a way that harnesses their diverse capabilities and mitigates their individual weaknesses, resulting in consistently improved performance across various metrics and tasks. The introduction of specialized ranking and fusion modules as well as the new benchmark dataset are key innovations presented in this work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from this paper:The paper proposes a new framework called LLM-Blender for ensembling multiple open-source large language models, consisting of a pairwise comparison module (PairRanker) to discern subtle differences between candidates and select the top outputs, followed by a generative fusion module (GenFuser) to merge strengths of the top selections and produce an improved final response.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper introduces a novel framework called LLM-Blender for ensembling and combining multiple large language models (LLMs). Ensembling LLMs is an active area of research, but most prior work has focused on techniques like knowledge distillation rather than post-hoc combination methods like this paper. So the approach is relatively unique.- A key contribution is the PairRanker module, which uses a specialized pairwise ranking method to discern subtle differences between candidate outputs from different LLMs. This kind of pairwise comparison and ranking has been explored before in other contexts, but seems to be novel and effective for comparing and selecting among LLM outputs.- The paper highlights the diversity in strengths/weaknesses of different open source LLMs. Other papers have also analyzed LLM performance, but this provides useful empirical evidence on the value of selectively combining models. The new MixInstruct dataset for comparing LLMs is also a contribution.- The proposed GenFuser module builds on prior work on techniques like FiD for fusing text, but adapts it for synthesizing the top-ranked LLM outputs. The overall pipeline of ranking then fusing is novel.- The results demonstrate sizeable gains in performance over individual LLM baselines as well as other ensemble methods. The analyses also provide insights into the method's effectiveness and limitations.Overall, LLM-Blender introduces a new approach to effectively combining multiple LLMs in a post-hoc, dynamic way. The pairwise ranking and fusion techniques seem promising based on the empirical results. If the code and models are released, this could be a useful contribution for both researchers and practitioners working with LLMs. The ideas could spur more research into specialized ranking and synthesis modules tailored for optimizing LLM ensembling.
