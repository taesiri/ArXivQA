# [LLM-Blender: Ensembling Large Language Models with Pairwise Ranking and   Generative Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02561)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we ensemble multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) in an effective way to achieve consistently superior performance across diverse natural language generation (NLG) tasks?The key hypotheses that the paper explores are:1) Different LLMs have diverse strengths and weaknesses, so intelligently combining their outputs could lead to better overall performance than relying on any single LLM.2) A specialized pairwise ranking model called PairReranker can more effectively discern subtle differences between candidate outputs compared to prior individual scoring methods.3) Further fusing the top-ranked candidates using a generative model called GenFuser can produce even better results by capitalizing on the strengths of the selected outputs. 4) The proposed framework, LLM-Blender, which integrates PairReranker and GenFuser, will significantly boost the performance of an ensemble of open-source LLMs across various metrics and tasks.So in summary, the paper introduces a novel approach for ensembling multiple LLMs in a way that taps into their complementary capabilities, with the goal of achieving superior and more robust performance on NLG tasks. The core research questions revolve around evaluating the proposed ranking, selection and fusion techniques.
