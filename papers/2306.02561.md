# [LLM-Blender: Ensembling Large Language Models with Pairwise Ranking and   Generative Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02561)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we ensemble multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) in an effective way to achieve consistently superior performance across diverse natural language generation (NLG) tasks?The key hypotheses that the paper explores are:1) Different LLMs have diverse strengths and weaknesses, so intelligently combining their outputs could lead to better overall performance than relying on any single LLM.2) A specialized pairwise ranking model called PairReranker can more effectively discern subtle differences between candidate outputs compared to prior individual scoring methods.3) Further fusing the top-ranked candidates using a generative model called GenFuser can produce even better results by capitalizing on the strengths of the selected outputs. 4) The proposed framework, LLM-Blender, which integrates PairReranker and GenFuser, will significantly boost the performance of an ensemble of open-source LLMs across various metrics and tasks.So in summary, the paper introduces a novel approach for ensembling multiple LLMs in a way that taps into their complementary capabilities, with the goal of achieving superior and more robust performance on NLG tasks. The core research questions revolve around evaluating the proposed ranking, selection and fusion techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called LLM-Blender for ensembling multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) in order to improve their robustness, generalization and accuracy. The key ideas are:1) Introducing a specialized pairwise comparison method called PairRanker to discern subtle differences between candidate outputs and effectively rank them. This helps select the best LLM for each example.2) Proposing a generative fusion module called GenFuser that merges the top-ranked candidates to produce an improved final output by capitalizing on their complementary strengths. 3) Creating a new benchmark dataset called MixInstruct for training and evaluating LLM ensembling techniques in the context of instruction-following tasks.4) Comprehensive empirical evaluation shows the proposed LLM-Blender framework significantly outperforms individual LLMs and baseline ensembling methods by effectively combining their unique contributions.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel and effective pipeline to ensemble multiple LLMs in a way that harnesses their diverse capabilities and mitigates their individual weaknesses, resulting in consistently improved performance across various metrics and tasks. The introduction of specialized ranking and fusion modules as well as the new benchmark dataset are key innovations presented in this work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from this paper:The paper proposes a new framework called LLM-Blender for ensembling multiple open-source large language models, consisting of a pairwise comparison module (PairRanker) to discern subtle differences between candidates and select the top outputs, followed by a generative fusion module (GenFuser) to merge strengths of the top selections and produce an improved final response.
