# [Proving the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Pruning is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00585)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper sets out to prove the strong lottery ticket hypothesis, which states that within a sufficiently overparameterized neural network with random weights (e.g. at initialization), there exists a subnetwork that achieves competitive accuracy without any training. 

The key research questions addressed are:

1) Can we theoretically prove the existence of good subnetworks within randomly initialized neural networks?

2) How does pruning weights compare to pruning entire neurons in terms of expressive power?

3) Can pruning a random network achieve competitive performance to optimizing the weights through training?

The main hypothesis is that pruning a randomly initialized overparameterized network can find a subnetwork that matches the accuracy of a target network, without any further training. The paper proves this formally for deep and shallow neural networks.

Overall, the paper provides theoretical evidence for the strong lottery ticket hypothesis. It shows the surprising result that competitive accuracy can be attained by simply pruning weights of a random network, without needing to optimize their values through training. The paper compares weight-based and neuron-based pruning, and demonstrates the greater expressive power of the former. The results motivate developing efficient algorithms for finding good subnetworks in large random networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents theoretical evidence for the lottery ticket hypothesis, which states that a randomly initialized neural network contains a small subnetwork that can match the performance of the full network when trained in isolation. 

The main contributions are:

1. Proving that a randomly initialized overparameterized ReLU network contains a subnetwork ("weight-subnetwork") that can approximate an arbitrary target ReLU network of any depth, without any training of the subnetwork. This is a stronger version of the original lottery ticket hypothesis.

2. Showing that pruning entire neurons in a network ("neuron-subnetwork") is equivalent in power to training only the last layer of a network (random features model). Hence neuron-subnetworks are more limited than weight-subnetworks.

3. Demonstrating that even neuron-subnetworks can efficiently fit finite datasets and functions in a neural network RKHS, despite their limitations compared to weight-subnetworks.

4. Proving hardness results, showing that finding the optimal subnetwork is computationally hard, both for weight and neuron-subnetworks.

5. Discussing implications on the universality and limitations of pruning methods. Overall, the results provide theoretical justification for the lottery ticket hypothesis and pruning methods in general. The paper sets the ground for further research on efficient pruning algorithms with provable guarantees.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point made in the paper:

The paper proves that a randomly initialized overparameterized neural network contains a subnetwork that achieves competitive accuracy compared to the full network, without any further training needed - supporting the lottery ticket hypothesis that trainable subnetworks exist at random initialization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on neural network pruning and the lottery ticket hypothesis:

- This paper provides theoretical evidence for the lottery ticket hypothesis by proving that randomly initialized overparameterized networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that can match the performance of the original network. Most prior work has focused on empirical evaluations, so this theoretical analysis helps explain why the phenomenon occurs.

- The paper differentiates between two types of subnetworks - pruning weights vs pruning entire neurons. It shows that weight pruning is more powerful and can approximate arbitrary target networks, while neuron pruning is equivalent to random features. This sheds light on the relative power of different pruning techniques. 

- Compared to other theoretical lottery ticket papers like Zhou et al. 2019 and Ramanujan et al. 2019, this work makes fewer assumptions and proves a stronger version of the conjecture from Ramanujan et al. It shows the existence of winning tickets without any training, rather than just good initialization.

- The paper gives a constructive proof by showing how to find good subnetworks via pruning. This is in contrast to some statistical/information-theoretic arguments on model compression. The pruning view could inspire new algorithms.

- The techniques are relatively simple (based on concentration bounds) compared to some statistical learning theory proofs. This makes the arguments more accessible.

- The paper links pruning to known hardness results for learning neural networks. This highlights interesting parallels between optimization and pruning.

Overall, this paper enhances our theoretical understanding of lottery tickets and pruning in significant ways compared to prior work. The pruning view and connections to optimization hardness are novel contributions to the field. The simple and accessible analysis helps clarify why the phenomenon occurs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing efficient heuristic algorithms for pruning randomly initialized neural networks. While the paper proves the existence of good subnetworks, finding them algorithmically is still an open challenge. The authors suggest developing heuristic pruning algorithms and analyzing them theoretically under certain distributional assumptions. 

- Improving the polynomial dependencies of the network size before pruning. The paper shows the existence of good subnetworks in networks that scale polynomially with the problem parameters. Reducing the degree of these polynomial dependencies could make the theoretical results more practical.

- Generalizing the theoretical results to other neural network architectures like convolutional networks and ResNets. The current results are proved for fully-connected feedforward networks. Extending the analysis to more complex and modern architectures is an important direction.

- Studying the relationship between pruning and optimizing weights theoretically. The paper shows pruning can achieve competitive results to weight training, but more work is needed to formally characterize and contrast these two paradigms.

- Providing more formal evidence for the lottery ticket hypothesis and related empirical phenomena about good subnetworks in randomly initialized networks. The current paper proves a version of this hypothesis but more theoretical work is needed to fully explain these intriguing observations.

In summary, the main themes are developing more practical algorithms, improving the theory, and extending the analysis to other neural network architectures in order to better understand random pruning and the lottery ticket hypothesis. Formalizing the connections to optimization and weight training is also an important direction suggested. Overall, the paper opens up many interesting avenues for future work at the intersection of neural network pruning, randomization, optimization, and generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proves the strong lottery ticket hypothesis, which states that a sufficiently over-parameterized neural network with random weights contains a subnetwork that achieves competitive accuracy on a task without any training. The authors show that for any target network with bounded weights, a larger random network of polynomial size contains a weight-subnetwork that approximates the target network. They also show that pruning entire neurons from a random network is equivalent in power to a random features model. The results provide theoretical justification for the lottery ticket hypothesis and suggest that neural network pruning may be as effective as optimizing weights. The paper demonstrates the expressive power of subnetworks within over-parameterized random neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proves the lottery ticket hypothesis, which states that a randomly initialized neural network contains a small subnetwork that can match the accuracy of the original network when trained in isolation. The authors show that for any target network with bounded weights, a sufficiently overparameterized neural network with random weights contains a pruned subnetwork that achieves similar accuracy to the target network, without any further training. 

Specifically, the paper differentiates between pruning weights and pruning entire neurons from the network. For weight pruning, they show that any target ReLU network can be approximated by pruning a random network of twice the depth. The size of the pruned network is similar, up to a constant factor, to the original target network. For neuron pruning, they prove it is equivalent in power to the random features model, and cannot efficiently approximate even a single ReLU neuron. Their results provide theoretical evidence for the lottery ticket hypothesis, and suggest that neural network pruning is a competitive alternative to weight optimization for finding highly accurate small networks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proves the strong lottery ticket hypothesis for over-parameterized neural networks. Specifically, it shows that for any bounded target network, a sufficiently wide randomly initialized network contains a subnetwork that achieves similar accuracy to the target network without any training. The key method is to analyze weight-pruning and neuron-pruning separately. For weight-pruning, the authors show how to approximate a target network layer-by-layer using a randomly initialized deeper network. Each layer in the original network requires two layers in the constructed network for the approximation. For neuron-pruning, the authors prove an equivalence with random feature models - a neuron-subnetwork exists if and only if an accurate random feature model exists. Together, these analyses demonstrate that a combination of weight and neuron pruning applied to an over-parameterized random network can recover an accurate subnetwork, providing theoretical evidence for the strong lottery ticket hypothesis.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Proving the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Pruning is All You Need" addresses the lottery ticket hypothesis proposed by Frankle and Carbin in 2018. The lottery ticket hypothesis states that a randomly initialized neural network contains a small subnetwork that can match the performance of the full network when trained in isolation. 

The paper provides theoretical evidence for an even stronger version of this hypothesis, which was conjectured by Ramanujan et al. in 2019. This stronger version states that a sufficiently overparameterized neural network with random weights contains a subnetwork that achieves competitive accuracy compared to the full network, without any further training.

Specifically, the key question addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to find a good subnetwork within a randomly initialized neural network, without any training. The authors prove this is possible for overparameterized networks, both deep and shallow. This gives theoretical justification for the lottery ticket hypothesis and its stronger variation. The paper differentiates between pruning weights and pruning entire neurons, showing the former is more powerful. Overall, the paper formally shows the surprising expressiveness of subnetworks within large random networks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The method relies on being able to find a small subnetwork within a larger randomly initialized network that can match the performance of the original network. How sensitive is this to the network architecture and initialization scheme? Does it hold for a wide variety of network types beyond standard fully-connected networks?

2. The theoretical guarantees focus on approximating target networks with bounded weights. How well does the method work for more realistically trained networks where weights can be unbounded? Do the guarantees still hold approximately?

3. Pruning the network involves removing connections. How is this implemented in practice for various network structures? For example, does pruning a convolution filter simply zero it out?

4. The paper shows a fundamental equivalence between optimizing weights and pruning. However, finding the optimal subnetwork to prune is also computationally hard. So what heuristic algorithms can work well in practice? What inductive biases should they encode?

5. The method is shown to be universal, in the sense that pruning can approximate any function. However, does it have any limitations or perform poorly on certain function classes? Are there counter-examples?

6. The paper focuses on standard image classification tasks. How well does the approach transfer to other problem domains like natural language processing? Do the theoretical results still apply cleanly?

7. The comparison between neuron pruning and weight pruning is insightful. Under what conditions does neuron pruning fail but weight pruning succeeds? Can we characterize the difference more precisely? 

8. The paper assumes pruning a randomly initialized network. How much do the results change if we allow pruning a partially trained network instead? Does that strengthen or weaken the theoretical guarantees?

9. The pruning process essentially selects part of the network. Could this process be interpreted as a kind of architecture search? Could pruning be used to find optimal architectures?

10. The method prunes an overparameterized network to match a smaller target network. Could the ideas be extended to transfer learning, where we prune a network trained on one task to match another target network?

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proves the lottery ticket hypothesis, which states that a randomly-initialized neural network contains a small subnetwork that can achieve competitive accuracy without any training. The authors show that for any target network with bounded weights, a sufficiently overparameterized neural network with random weights contains a subnetwork that approximates the target network to arbitrary accuracy. They differentiate between weight-based pruning, where specific weights are removed, and neuron-based pruning, where entire neurons are removed. For weight-based pruning, they show that a network of any depth can be approximated by pruning a random network of double the depth. For neuron-based pruning, they show an equivalence with random feature models, implying limitations in the ability to efficiently approximate even a single neuron. Overall, the paper provides theoretical evidence for the lottery ticket hypothesis by formally proving the existence of highly accurate subnetworks within randomly initialized networks. The results motivate developing algorithms that focus on finding good subnetworks rather than training the full network.
