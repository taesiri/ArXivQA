# [PPTC-R benchmark: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language   Models for PowerPoint Task Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in complex task completion scenarios. This robustness is critical for deploying LLMs as agents to help users complete tasks. 

- Existing robustness evaluations focus on adversarial attacks on basic NLP tasks. There is no analysis of how perturbations to user instructions and software versions impact an LLM's ability to call the right APIs to complete tasks.

Proposed Solution - PPTC-R Benchmark:
- The paper proposes the PowerPoint Task Completion Robustness (PPTC-R) benchmark to test an LLM's robustness when facing adversarial user instructions and different software versions for completing PowerPoint tasks.

- Adversarial instructions are created via sentence-level (adding chitchat), semantic-level (paraphrasing), and language-level (translation) perturbations.

- Software version robustness is evaluated by adding/removing APIs to simulate version upgrades/downgrades.

- 7 major LLMs are tested on the benchmark.

Key Contributions:
- PPTC-R is the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs on task completion robustness for calling APIs correctly. The perturbation methods can be reused for other datasets.

- Experiments show GPT-4 has the overall best performance and robustness, but all LLMs struggle when difficulties compound across instructions and environment.

- Analysis of errors and behaviors provides insights into current limitations of LLMs for robust task completion, guiding future research.

In summary, the paper presents PPTC-R, the first robustness benchmark and analysis focused on LLMs correctly calling APIs for complex task completion under adversarial user instructions and software versions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new benchmark, PPTC-R, to evaluate the robustness of large language models in completing complex PowerPoint tasks under adversarial user instructions and different software versions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes the PowerPoint Task Completion-Robustness (PPTC-R) benchmark, which is the first benchmark for measuring and analyzing large language models' (LLMs) robustness to user instructions and software versions in complex PowerPoint task completion settings. 

2) It tests 7 LLMs (including closed-source like GPT-4 and open-source like LLaMa-2) in the benchmark and finds that GPT-4 achieves the best performance with strong robustness. However, all LLMs' robustness degrades when increasing task difficulty.

3) It provides detailed analysis of the error reasons and robustness behaviors of LLMs in the benchmark, giving valuable insights for understanding LLMs' robustness in task completion and designing more robust agents.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new benchmark (PPTC-R) to evaluate LLMs' robustness in complex task completion settings and using it to test LLMs and analyze their behaviors.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes several methods to construct adversarial user instructions, including sentence-level, semantic-level, and language-level perturbations. How do these different perturbation methods compare in terms of difficulty for the language models? Which one poses the biggest challenge?

2. The paper finds that overcoming sentence-level perturbations is more difficult than semantic-level perturbations for the language models. What are some potential reasons behind this finding? 

3. For the language-level robustness experiments, what considerations went into selecting the 14 non-English target languages? How might the choice of languages impact the results?

4. The paper introduces two types of API perturbations - lack and update. What are the key differences in how these perturbations impact the language models' performance? Which one is more challenging and why?

5. The paper reports average performance drop rates (APDR) across different tasks and settings. What trends can be observed from the APDR results in terms of how task difficulty and environment complexity impact robustness?

6. For the error analysis, the paper identifies three main error reasons - being distracted by chitchat, calling unavailable APIs, and misunderstanding instructions. What are some potential ways to address these errors to improve robustness? 

7. How does the number of new APIs introduced impact model performance and behavior? What can be concluded from the analysis in Section 4.2?

8. Could the proposed methods for generating adversarial user instructions be applied to other task completion benchmarks beyond PowerPoint? What considerations would need to be made?

9. What are some key limitations of the robustness benchmark proposed in the paper? What additional experiments could be run to further analyze model robustness?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on perturbing user instructions and software APIs. What other aspects of the task completion setting could be perturbed to evaluate robustness (e.g. visual environment)?
