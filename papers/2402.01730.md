# [Evaluating LLM -- Generated Multimodal Diagnosis from Medical Images and   Symptom Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing correctness and accuracy of medical diagnosis generated by large language models (LLMs) is critical but not yet properly evaluated. 
- Validation and evaluation are crucial for AI systems in healthcare given low tolerance for mistakes and high risks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a 2-step LLM evaluation paradigm: 
   1) Multimodal LLM evaluation via structured interactions using medical images and multiple choice questions.
   2) Follow-up domain-specific analysis of interactions using image metadata analysis, named entity recognition and knowledge graphs.

- This is applied to evaluate multimodal diagnosis abilities of GPT-4-Vision-Preview in pathology using publicly available medical exam questions.

Key Contributions:
- Evaluation showed GPT-4-Vision-Preview scored 84% accuracy in multimodal pathology exam with 79 questions.
- Analysis revealed strengths and weaknesses - weaknesses found in cardiovascular, skin and endocrine system image analysis.
- Specific conditions like atherosclerosis, dissection and diabetes are areas for improvement.
- Proposed methodology and analysis provides framework to evaluate LLMs' multimodal medical diagnosis abilities, extract insights on strengths/weaknesses and guide optimized training.

In summary, the paper presents a rigorous 2-step evaluation and analysis paradigm for multimodal LLMs in medical diagnosis, applies it to GPT-4-Vision-Preview and shows how it can reveal areas for improvement via tailored training. The method and findings could be generalized for optimizing other LLMs.
