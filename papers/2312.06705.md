# [Perceiving University Student's Opinions from Google App Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement 
The paper focuses on analyzing the behavior and opinions of university students towards Google Play apps, in comparison to general public reviews on Google Play store. It aims to extract and analyze student sentiments from their app reviews using sentiment analysis and machine/deep learning models. The huge volume of app reviews makes manual analysis difficult, hence automated solutions are needed.  

Proposed Solution
The authors collected 10,841 Google Play app reviews as the training dataset, and 400 student reviews from Utkal University as the test set. They performed cleaning and pre-processing on the text data. Then sentiment analysis is applied by employing different techniques:

1) Text representation schemes - Bag of Words, Term Presence, Term Frequency, TF-IDF; with uni/bi/tri-grams
2) Machine learning algorithms - SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes. Evaluated using accuracy and F1-score.
3) Deep learning models - LSTM, CNN, RNN using word embedding technique GloVe.

Additionally, 10 research questions were analyzed visually to compare student behavior with the training set.

Key Contributions  
- Novel collection and analysis of Utkal Univ student app reviews dataset for comparison against public Google Play reviews
- Range of machine learning and deep learning techniques employed for sentiment classification
- Visual and empirical analysis to answer research questions related to app ratings, pricing, sentiments etc.  
- SVM with bi-gram and TF-IDF gives best accuracy of 93.41%. LSTM model using GloVe embedding provides highest accuracy of 95.2%.
- Analysis provides insights into differences of students versus general public opinions, guiding app development and availability.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis framework leveraging a specially curated student dataset, to uncover university student preferences and perspectives on Google Play apps as compared to the general public. Both traditional ML techniques as well as latest deep learning methods are explored for this purpose.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a sentiment analysis framework using machine learning and deep learning methods to analyze Google app reviews and compare university students' opinions and behavior towards Google apps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a sentiment analysis approach for mining opinions from Google app reviews and comparing sentiment trends between the Google app corpus and reviews from university students. The main contributions include:

1) Formulating 10 research questions to analyze correlations between app market characteristics like price, popularity, size, categories, genres, and ratings between the student dataset and Google app corpus. The questions are investigated through visualizations.

2) Implementing various text representation schemes (term presence, term frequency, TF-IDF) with uni-gram, bi-gram and tri-gram models on the Google app corpus.

3) Applying supervised machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression etc. on the text representation schemes and comparing performance using accuracy and F-score. SVM performed best.  

4) Using the ensemble learning method of bagging to enhance Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes performance.

5) Applying deep learning models like LSTM, CNN, RNN on word embeddings (GloVe) for the corpus and comparing to the machine learning approaches. LSTM with GloVe gave the highest accuracy of 95.2%.

6) Collecting a new real-world university student review dataset for testing instead of using cross-validation.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an analysis that compares Google app review sentiments with university student reviews using a combination of data visualization, machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) What was the motivation to design the text representation schemes of TP, TF and TF-IDF and also use the n-gram model in this study? How do these schemes help in feature engineering for machine learning algorithms?

2) Bagging was used as an ensemble learning method in this study. Explain why bagging helps improve the robustness and performance of base estimator models. How specifically was bagging applied with LR and NB models in this research?

3) Why was the GloVe word embedding scheme chosen to be used with the deep learning methods in this study? What are some of the advantages of using GloVe over other word embedding techniques?

4) Explain the LSTM and RNN architectures used in this research. What are some of the advantages these models have over other deep learning methods for sentiment analysis? 

5) What was the rationale behind collecting a separate test dataset of students' app reviews? Why was this considered important instead of using k-fold cross validation on just the Google Play store data?

6) What were some of the key text pre-processing and data cleaning steps applied on both the training (Google app reviews) and test (students app reviews) datasets? Why are these important?

7) The paper evaluates performance of models using accuracy and F-score metrics. Explain why both metrics were chosen instead of relying on just accuracy or another single metric?

8) How specifically was the bagging ensemble method implemented with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models? What benefits did bagging provide over just directly using these base models?

9) What were some of the challenges and limitations faced in collecting the student app review test dataset? How could this data collection be improved in future work? 

10) For the deep learning methods, how were optimal model hyperparameters like batch size, number of epochs etc. selected through experimentation? Was any tuning done specifically for the student app review dataset?
