# [Perceiving University Student's Opinions from Google App Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement 
The paper focuses on analyzing the behavior and opinions of university students towards Google Play apps, in comparison to general public reviews on Google Play store. It aims to extract and analyze student sentiments from their app reviews using sentiment analysis and machine/deep learning models. The huge volume of app reviews makes manual analysis difficult, hence automated solutions are needed.  

Proposed Solution
The authors collected 10,841 Google Play app reviews as the training dataset, and 400 student reviews from Utkal University as the test set. They performed cleaning and pre-processing on the text data. Then sentiment analysis is applied by employing different techniques:

1) Text representation schemes - Bag of Words, Term Presence, Term Frequency, TF-IDF; with uni/bi/tri-grams
2) Machine learning algorithms - SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes. Evaluated using accuracy and F1-score.
3) Deep learning models - LSTM, CNN, RNN using word embedding technique GloVe.

Additionally, 10 research questions were analyzed visually to compare student behavior with the training set.

Key Contributions  
- Novel collection and analysis of Utkal Univ student app reviews dataset for comparison against public Google Play reviews
- Range of machine learning and deep learning techniques employed for sentiment classification
- Visual and empirical analysis to answer research questions related to app ratings, pricing, sentiments etc.  
- SVM with bi-gram and TF-IDF gives best accuracy of 93.41%. LSTM model using GloVe embedding provides highest accuracy of 95.2%.
- Analysis provides insights into differences of students versus general public opinions, guiding app development and availability.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis framework leveraging a specially curated student dataset, to uncover university student preferences and perspectives on Google Play apps as compared to the general public. Both traditional ML techniques as well as latest deep learning methods are explored for this purpose.
