# [A Step-by-step Introduction to the Implementation of Automatic   Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic differentiation is a key technique in deep learning, but teaching it can be challenging. Existing materials cover the basic concepts, but lack details on implementation. Sophisticated implementations in DL frameworks are too complex for students to understand. 
- There is a gap between the basic concepts (e.g. computational graphs) and actual implementation details. Students are left wondering how concepts map to implementation.

Proposed Solution: 
- Provide a step-by-step tutorial to bridge the gap between AD concepts and implementation. Specifically:
   - Use the same example function as existing literature for consistency 
   - Streamline math concepts and implementation details
   - Explain motivations behind each implementation choice
   - Make it self-contained and suitable for beginners

Key Contributions:
- Implements forward mode automatic differentiation from scratch in Python
   - Defines Node class to store compute graph
   - Wrapping functions to build graph via nested calls
   - DFS traversal for topological node ordering  
   - Calculation of partial derivatives along ordering
- Walks through computational graph visualization in tandem with implementation
- Explains need for function evaluation before derivative calculation
- Discusses handling of chain rule and dependencies in implementation
- Comprehensive tutorial with slides, code and documentation for teaching

In summary, this paper provides a gentle, step-by-step introduction to implementing automatic differentiation concepts. By connecting theory to coding details and explaining key design choices, it makes AD more accessible for students to learn. The complete tutorial is useful for teaching this important technique.
