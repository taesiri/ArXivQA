# [MAtch, eXpand and Improve: Unsupervised Finetuning for Zero-Shot Action   Recognition with Language Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08914)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper appears to address the following central research questions:1. Is it possible to fine-tune large-scale pretrained vision-language (VL) models for effective zero-shot transfer to action recognition tasks while only leveraging unlabeled video data? 2. Can the knowledge of language be harnessed to expand beyond the limited action vocabulary available in annotated action recognition datasets?The key hypotheses seem to be:- Unlabeled video data can be effectively utilized to significantly improve zero-shot transfer performance on action recognition for pretrained VL models, without needing annotated data.- By combining unlabeled video data with "bags" of language knowledge mined from vision-conditioned (e.g. CLIP, BLIP) and pure language-conditioned (e.g. GPT-3) sources, the performance of VL models on unseen zero-shot action recognition can be substantially boosted.In summary, the core research questions are around improving zero-shot action recognition for VL models like CLIP using only unlabeled videos and leveraging diverse language knowledge sources, removing the need for full supervision or annotated action datasets. The proposed method MAXI aims to address these questions by constructing text bags for unlabeled videos and employing techniques like multiple instance learning to effectively fine-tune VL models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper does not appear to have a main contribution stated explicitly. However, based on my reading, the key points seem to be:- The authors propose an approach called "Match, Expand and Improve (MAXI)" for finetuning vision-language (VL) models like CLIP on unlabeled video data and an unpaired action dictionary to improve performance on downstream zero-shot and few-shot action recognition tasks. - The key idea is to construct "text bags" for each unlabeled video by matching to the dictionary, expanding via a language model like GPT-3, and captioning frames with a VL model like BLIP. These noisy text bags act as pseudo-labels. - They use a multiple instance learning objective to finetune CLIP on the unlabeled videos and text bags. This allows robust training without ground truth labels.- Experiments on 7 downstream action recognition datasets show MAXI improves over CLIP by up to 14% on zero-shot transfer and also outperforms supervised baselines.- Ablations validate the approach of using text bags from diverse language sources and learning via multiple instance learning.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and validating an unsupervised approach to finetune VL models on unlabeled video plus an unpaired dictionary to improve zero-shot and few-shot action recognition, using text bags and multiple instance learning. The key novelty is enabling effective VL finetuning without labeled data.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of vision-language models for zero-shot action recognition:- The key contribution of this paper is proposing an unsupervised approach to adapt vision-language (VL) models for zero-shot and few-shot action recognition using unlabeled video data. This is different from prior work like ActionCLIP, XCLIP, ViFi-CLIP etc. which rely on fully supervised finetuning with annotated video datasets. - The proposed method "Match, Expand and Improve (MAXI)" constructs "text bags" for each unlabeled video by matching to an action dictionary, expanding via a language model like GPT-3, and captioning frames with BLIP. It then uses these text bags in a multiple instance learning setup for finetuning.- So the novelty is in leveraging multiple language sources in an unsupervised manner for VL model finetuning, without needing any labeled video data. This helps improve zero-shot transfer by making better use of language knowledge.- The results show MAXI significantly outperforms the base VL model like CLIP in zero-shot action recognition on 7 datasets. It is competitive or even outperforms supervised baselines. This demonstrates the efficacy of unsupervised finetuning with diverse language sources.- For few-shot learning, MAXI also shows noticeable gains over CLIP and supervised methods, indicating improved generalization.- Overall, this work makes a valuable contribution in exploring unsupervised VL adaptation for videos using language knowledge, going beyond limitations of supervised finetuning on annotated datasets. The gains validate the usefulness of matching, expanding and improving VL models with text bag representations for unlabeled video collections.In summary, the key novelty of this work is in its unsupervised finetuning approach using diverse language sources, which leads to improved zero-shot and few-shot action recognition performance compared to existing supervised methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors of the paper suggest the following future research directions:- Exploring more sophisticated language models and learning objectives to better construct text bags for unlabeled videos. They mention that more advanced language models like GPT-3 could generate more diverse and accurate text descriptions. Different learning objectives like mutual information maximization could also help associate videos and text bags more effectively.- Extending the approach to other vision-language tasks beyond action recognition, such as video captioning, temporal grounding, etc. The proposed method of leveraging language knowledge to finetune vision-language models on unlabeled video data could be beneficial for various video understanding tasks.- Incorporating some forms of weak supervision during training, such as partial labels or constraints on the text bags. Weak supervision signals could potentially further improve the learning from unlabeled videos compared to a fully unsupervised approach.- Developing better evaluation protocols and benchmarks to measure the model's ability to learn visual concepts purely from language knowledge. More diagnostic datasets could help analyze the impact of different language sources.- Exploring self-supervised pretraining objectives that can better capture verb semantics as opposed to just noun semantics. This could alleviate the language bias issue in vision-language models.In summary, the main future directions are leveraging more advanced language models, extending the approach to other video tasks, incorporating weak supervision, developing better evaluation benchmarks, and designing pretraining objectives that learn verb semantics better. The key is to improve the association of videos and language knowledge to enable more effective learning from unlabeled video data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an unsupervised approach for finetuning vision-language (VL) models on unlabeled video data to improve zero-shot action recognition performance. The key idea is to leverage multiple language sources, such as an unpaired action dictionary, large language models (LLMs), and VL models, to construct "text bags" for each unlabeled video. These text bags contain noisy collections of text prompts that potentially describe the video contents. A VL model like CLIP is then finetuned on the unlabeled videos paired with the text bags using a multiple instance learning objective. Experiments on 7 unseen action recognition benchmarks show the proposed approach, called MAXI, significantly improves upon the original CLIP model by up to 14% in zero-shot action recognition. MAXI also favorably competes with supervised finetuning baselines, and even outperforms them in some cases. The advantage is that MAXI does not require expensive human annotations for model finetuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an unsupervised approach for finetuning vision-language models on unlabeled video data to improve zero-shot action recognition performance. The key idea is to leverage multiple language sources like unpaired action dictionaries, large language models, and captioning models to construct "text bags" corresponding to each unlabeled video. These text bags provide noisy supervision signals for finetuning the model via a multiple instance learning objective, without needing any manually annotated video data. Specifically, the approach first adapts a vision-language model like CLIP to encode video frames. Then for each unlabeled video, it constructs a text bag containing related action phrases obtained via: 1) Matching to an action dictionary 2) Expanding matched phrases using GPT-3 3) Generating frame captions using BLIP. This text bag is associated with the video encoding using a multiple instance learning loss. Extensive experiments on multiple action recognition benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot transfer over the original vision-language model, and competitive performance compared to fully supervised finetuning. The key advantage is the unsupervised finetuning approach that avoids costly annotation while leveraging rich language knowledge.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes an unsupervised approach called MAXI (Match, Expand and Improve) for finetuning vision-language (VL) models like CLIP on unlabeled video data to improve their performance on downstream zero-shot and few-shot action recognition tasks. Given an unlabeled video collection and an unpaired action dictionary, MAXI constructs a "text bag" for each video by matching the video representations to the dictionary using CLIP, expanding the matched texts with GPT-3, and generating captions with BLIP. These noisy text bags are then used to finetune CLIP on the unlabeled videos via a multiple instance learning objective that associates each video with the text bags of other videos with the same best dictionary match. This allows adapting CLIP to video and incorporating diverse language knowledge without any manual annotation. Experiments show MAXI significantly improves over CLIP and competes with supervised methods on unseen action recognition benchmarks.
