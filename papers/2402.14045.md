# [Advancing Low-Rank and Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation in Medical   Imaging: A Systematic Literature Review and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14045)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Medical images face challenges like noise, artifacts, large data volumes, high dimensionality, etc. These issues negatively impact critical processes like image registration.  
- Traditional low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) methods cannot fully capture the local variations and fine details in medical images.
- Local low-rank matrix approximation (LLRMA) overcomes limitations of LRMA but has its own drawbacks like patch artifacts.

Solution:
- This paper conducts a systematic literature review on LRMA and LLRMA techniques applied to medical images. 
- 47 relevant publications from 2006-2023 are analyzed. 25 use LRMA, while 32 employ LLRMA on modalities like MRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, etc.

- The review compares LRMA and LLRMA in capturing complex spatial structures in medical data. It critiques commonly used similarity measures like Euclidean distance and block matching.

- Advanced semantic segmentation models like DeepLab are proposed to improve similarity measurement by extracting visual features and semantic information from image patches.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies shift in preference from LRMA to LLRMA in medical imaging since 2015, indicating LLRMA's superior ability to represent local complex patterns.  

- Discusses limitations of prevalent shallow similarity techniques and suggests DeepLab's feasibility for enhanced patch comparisons.

- Recommends expanding LRMA/LLRMA to other structured and semi-structured medical data types based on their low-rank properties. 

- Proposes a randomized search method combined with Bayesian optimization to systematically determine optimal patch size for medical image analysis.

- Provides a valuable reference summarizing various LRMA techniques, performance tradeoffs, strengths and weaknesses based on in-depth literature analysis.

In summary, this comprehensive review offers key insights on advancing LRMA and LLRMA techniques for medical imaging by critiquing existing literature and proposing techniques to overcome limitations. The suggestions around improving similarity measurement, expanding applications and finding optimal parameters can help boost effectiveness.
