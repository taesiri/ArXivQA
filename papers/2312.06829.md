# [Encoding Surgical Videos as Latent Spatiotemporal Graphs for Object and   Anatomy-Driven Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06829)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Surgical video analysis aims to gain insights into surgical procedures, but effectively learning and reasoning about surgical anatomy remains challenging. Prior object-centric video representations have limitations such as only modeling surgical tools, being limited to short clips, or only outputting scene graphs without retaining visual features.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a method to encode entire surgical videos as latent spatiotemporal graphs, with nodes representing anatomical structures and tools, and edges representing spatial relationships within a frame as well as temporal relationships between frames.

- To construct the graphs, frame-wise graphs are first predicted using a pre-trained model from a prior work. Temporal edges are then added between spatially and visually similar nodes across frames, using multiple temporal horizons to capture both short and long-term evolution of the scene.  

- A graph editing module is introduced to correct errors in the predicted graphs using temporal coherence and anatomical constraints.

- The resulting spatiotemporal graph is processed by a graph neural network to obtain node features that aggregate information across space and time. These features can be used directly for various downstream tasks.

Main Contributions:

1. A method to encode surgical videos as latent spatiotemporal graphs representing anatomical structures, tools and their spatial and temporal relationships.

2. A framework to model long-range temporal relationships via multi-horizon graph connectivity.

3. A graph editing module to correct errors in predicted graphs based on temporal coherence and anatomical constraints.

4. Demonstrated effectiveness of learned representations on tasks requiring fine-grained anatomical understanding (CVS prediction) and long-range video modeling (phase recognition).
