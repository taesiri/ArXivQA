# [Exploring Language Model's Code Generation Ability with Auxiliary   Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10575)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation tasks when provided with helpful prompts. Auxiliary functions, which handle subroutines or easier versions of target functions, are one useful prompt component. 
- However, there has been no systematic analysis of how LLMs utilize these auxiliary functions to improve code generation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new dataset called HumanExtension which contains 151 examples of Python function pairs, where one function extends the functionality of the other.
- Using this dataset, the authors comprehensively evaluate several LLMs' ability to leverage auxiliary functions. They design prompts with a single auxiliary function, vary factors like function relevance and implementation availability, and analyze effectiveness, robustness, and implementation styles.
- They also examine cases with multiple auxiliary functions, where models must selectively utilize the appropriate one. The position of the relevant function is varied to test robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of the HumanExtension dataset to enable analysis of auxiliary function usage in code generation.
- Extensive experiments highlighting LLMs' capabilities and limitations in harnessing auxiliary functions. Most models show large improvements with proper relevant functions.
- Analysis revealing models' varying abilities depending on non-functional factors, raising robustness questions.
- Implementation style analysis uncovering models' preference for repeating logic over simply calling provided functions, unlike humans.
- Results suggesting future research directions of enhancing auxiliary function call abilities and developing more robust methodologies.

The paper performs an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' proficiency in utilizing auxiliary functions for code generation. Through multi-faceted analysis, it provides fundamental understandings towards improving prompt engineering with auxiliary functions. The introduced dataset also facilitates research along this direction.
