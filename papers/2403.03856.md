# [Public-data Assisted Private Stochastic Optimization: Power and   Limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03856)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the fundamental limits and applications of using public data to assist differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization and supervised learning. Specifically, it considers two settings - when the public data is complete/labeled (same features and labels as the private data), and when the public data is unlabeled (only features without labels).

Results for Labeled Public Data:
- The paper shows a tight lower bound that implies using labeled public data provides no asymptotic gain in rates for DP stochastic convex optimization or generalized linear models, compared to simply discarding the private data or treating all data as private. 

- The lower bound obtained is Ω(min{1/√n_pub, 1/√n + √d/(nε)}) on the excess risk, matching existing upper bounds up to constants.

- The proof uses a new analysis of fingerprinting codes and reduction from lower bounds for differentially private mean estimation.

Results for Unlabeled Public Data:
- In contrast, the paper shows novel algorithms that can effectively use unlabeled public data in DP supervised learning of GLMs and beyond.

- For GLMs, the paper gives an efficient algorithm that uses dimensionality reduction via the public data to achieve a dimension-independent rate of Õ(1/√n_priv + 1/(n_privε)^{1/2}) using Õ(n_privε) unlabeled samples. This matches lower bounds.

- The algorithmic idea is extended to hypothesis classes with finite fat-shattering dimension. Applications to learning neural networks and non-Euclidean GLMs are provided.

Main Contributions:
- Novel lower bounds delimiting usefulness of labeled public data in DP optimization/GLMs
- New algorithms leveraging unlabeled public data to efficiently learn GLMs and more complex supervised learning models under DP constraints.
- Extensions of algorithmic ideas to broader hypothesis classes using notions offat-shattering dimension.

The paper significantly advances our understanding of fundamental tradeoffs and optimal strategies for utilizing public data to improve differentially private supervised learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It establishes tight lower bounds for differentially private stochastic convex optimization with complete/labeled public data, showing that more sophisticated attempts at leveraging the public data cannot substantially improve performance over simple strategies like discarding the private data or treating all data as private.

2. It provides new algorithms and analysis for supervised learning with unlabeled public data and private labels. In particular, for generalized linear models, it gives an efficient algorithm that achieves dimension-independent excess risk bounds by using the public data for dimensionality reduction. 

3. It extends the guarantees for generalized linear models to more general hypothesis classes with bounded fat-shattering dimension, with applications to learning neural networks. It shows how public unlabeled data can be used to construct finite hypothesis class representations that allow for proper learning.

4. It provides lower bounds that elucidate the limits of what is possible with unlabeled public data in private supervised learning settings.

In summary, a key contribution is delineating the limitations and capabilities of public data in differentially private machine learning through novel algorithms and matching upper and lower bounds. The work contrasts the usefulness of labeled versus unlabeled public data and provides some of the first positive results for leveraging unlabeled public data in private supervised learning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an algorithm for efficient PA-DP learning of GLMs using unlabeled public data. Can you explain in detail how the dimensionality reduction procedure works and why projecting onto the span of the public data vectors enables better utility? 

2. Theorem 1 shows an upper bound on the excess risk for efficient PA-DP learning of GLMs. Walk through the key steps in the proof and explain how the use of public unlabeled data leads to the dimension-independent rate. 

3. The paper shows lower bounds indicating the optimality of the proposed GLM learning method. Explain the proof techniques used to establish the lower bound with full knowledge of the marginal distribution (Theorem 3).

4. For the lower bound on required number of public samples (Theorem 4), discuss how the connection to the PA-DP SCO lower bound is made and why this establishes the near tight public sample complexity.

5. The paper generalizes the results to hypothesis classes with bounded fat-shattering dimension. Explain in detail the cover construction used and how Lemma 1 allows translation of the empirical cover to a population cover.  

6. Walk through the steps of the proof of Theorem 2 for fat-shattering classes and discuss how the cover size bound (Lemma 5) and uniform convergence result (Theorem 6) are applied.

7. The application to learning neural networks is shown in Corollary 1. Explain how the Rademacher complexity result of Theorem 7 is used and discuss the dependencies on the depth and weight bounds. 

8. For the application to non-Euclidean GLMs, walk through how the results on covering numbers and Rademacher complexity lead to the rate shown in Corollary 2. How does this contrast with existing results?

9. The paper establishes new lower bounds for PA-DP mean estimation. Discuss the need for robust analysis of the correlation bounds when public data is present. 

10. For the lower bound in Theorem 2, explain why the introduction of the intermediate distribution $S_z$ and clipping arguments are necessary and how these place restrictions on the problem parameters.
