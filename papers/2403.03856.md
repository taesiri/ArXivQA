# [Public-data Assisted Private Stochastic Optimization: Power and   Limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03856)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the fundamental limits and applications of using public data to assist differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization and supervised learning. Specifically, it considers two settings - when the public data is complete/labeled (same features and labels as the private data), and when the public data is unlabeled (only features without labels).

Results for Labeled Public Data:
- The paper shows a tight lower bound that implies using labeled public data provides no asymptotic gain in rates for DP stochastic convex optimization or generalized linear models, compared to simply discarding the private data or treating all data as private. 

- The lower bound obtained is Ω(min{1/√n_pub, 1/√n + √d/(nε)}) on the excess risk, matching existing upper bounds up to constants.

- The proof uses a new analysis of fingerprinting codes and reduction from lower bounds for differentially private mean estimation.

Results for Unlabeled Public Data:
- In contrast, the paper shows novel algorithms that can effectively use unlabeled public data in DP supervised learning of GLMs and beyond.

- For GLMs, the paper gives an efficient algorithm that uses dimensionality reduction via the public data to achieve a dimension-independent rate of Õ(1/√n_priv + 1/(n_privε)^{1/2}) using Õ(n_privε) unlabeled samples. This matches lower bounds.

- The algorithmic idea is extended to hypothesis classes with finite fat-shattering dimension. Applications to learning neural networks and non-Euclidean GLMs are provided.

Main Contributions:
- Novel lower bounds delimiting usefulness of labeled public data in DP optimization/GLMs
- New algorithms leveraging unlabeled public data to efficiently learn GLMs and more complex supervised learning models under DP constraints.
- Extensions of algorithmic ideas to broader hypothesis classes using notions offat-shattering dimension.

The paper significantly advances our understanding of fundamental tradeoffs and optimal strategies for utilizing public data to improve differentially private supervised learning.
