# [GNBG-Generated Test Suite for Box-Constrained Numerical Global   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07034)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a carefully constructed test suite of 24 box-constrained global optimization problem instances, systematically generated using the Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG). Spanning unimodal, multimodal single-component, and multimodal multi-component landscapes, these problems are designed to evaluate algorithms across diverse controlled conditions like modality, conditioning, symmetry, deceptiveness, basin landscapes, and variable interactions. The test problems feature tunable characteristics and difficulty levels to rigorously assess an optimization algorithm's strengths and limitations. For instance, problems like the ill-conditioned unimodal $f_3$ and highly irregular, asymmetric multimodal $f_{19}$ aim to evaluate resilience to complex search landscapes. Similarly, the deceptive $f_{21}$ with a dominant central basin tests algorithms' ability to avoid entanglement in promising regions. Such focused benchmarking delivers insights into areas needing refinement. By covering a spectrum of curated test cases, this paper provides a structured methodology for thoroughly analyzing optimization algorithms. The GNBG generator and problem suite enable customizable and reproducible algorithm evaluations.
