# [GNBG-Generated Test Suite for Box-Constrained Numerical Global   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07034)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a carefully constructed test suite of 24 box-constrained global optimization problem instances, systematically generated using the Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG). Spanning unimodal, multimodal single-component, and multimodal multi-component landscapes, these problems are designed to evaluate algorithms across diverse controlled conditions like modality, conditioning, symmetry, deceptiveness, basin landscapes, and variable interactions. The test problems feature tunable characteristics and difficulty levels to rigorously assess an optimization algorithm's strengths and limitations. For instance, problems like the ill-conditioned unimodal $f_3$ and highly irregular, asymmetric multimodal $f_{19}$ aim to evaluate resilience to complex search landscapes. Similarly, the deceptive $f_{21}$ with a dominant central basin tests algorithms' ability to avoid entanglement in promising regions. Such focused benchmarking delivers insights into areas needing refinement. By covering a spectrum of curated test cases, this paper provides a structured methodology for thoroughly analyzing optimization algorithms. The GNBG generator and problem suite enable customizable and reproducible algorithm evaluations.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Benchmark problem suites are essential for empirically evaluating and analyzing the performance of optimization algorithms. However, commonly used benchmark suites lack problem instances with tunable characteristics and known ground truths.

- To address this, the authors introduce the Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG) - a tool to systematically generate customizable test problem instances with controllable features for benchmarking optimization algorithms. 

Proposed Solution - GNBG:
- GNBG provides a flexible parametric function to generate optimization problem instances. By tuning various parameters, it can generate unconstrained problems with desirable properties.

- Key characteristics that can be configured include: modality, local optima features, variable interaction structures, symmetry/asymmetry, conditioning, basin linearity, deception, etc.

- Components with tunable morphologies can be integrated into the function. Various transformations further enrich instance complexity. 

- Scalability wrt dimensionality is a key feature. By composing components, GNBG can generate heterogeneous landscapes.

Contributions: 
- The authors carefully craft a suite of 24 scalable box-constrained problem instances of 30 dimensions using GNBG.

- These test cases are categorized as unimodal (6), multimodal single-component (9), multimodal multi-component (9). They offer varying difficulty levels and characteristics.

- By open-sourcing these instances, along with the GNBG generator, the authors provide the community with a systematic framework for evaluating optimization algorithms. 

- The test suite enables analyzing algorithm performance across diverse controlled conditions like modality, conditioning, deception, etc. This facilitates identifying strengths/limitations.

- Overall, the paper presents a customizable toolkit for rigorous benchmarking of new/existing optimization techniques.
