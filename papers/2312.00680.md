# [Contextualized word senses: from attention to compositionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00680)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new compositional, interpretable approach for encoding the contextual meaning of words in sentences. It is based on syntactic dependencies between words and the notion of selectional preferences, where related words impose semantic restrictions on each other. Specifically, the meaning of a word is combined with the generic sense of its paradigmatic class in that syntactic relation. This allows for an incremental, recursive process to build word senses. The proposed model, DepFunc, was evaluated on a multilingual sentence similarity task against Transformer models utilizing attention mechanisms. Despite having far fewer parameters and less training data, DepFunc achieved competitive results, with average Spearman correlations of 50 vs 47 for BERT. This demonstrates the potential for more transparent, linguistically-motivated architectures to match the performance of complex neural models while also providing interpretability. Limitations like handling open syntax are discussed, and future work may explore integrating symbolic knowledge to guide neural models. Overall, the paper argues for and provides support that explicit compositional operations can produce effective contextualized word representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a transparent and interpretable compositional strategy to encode contextualized word meanings based on syntactic dependencies and selection preferences, and shows it is competitive with complex neural models like BERT for a sentence similarity task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new symbolic-based language modeling strategy to encode the sense of words in context. More specifically, the paper defines a semantic method that uses compositional rules applied on dependency trees to both build the meaning of complex expressions and to contextualize the sense of the constituent words. The proposed compositional method is compared to Transformer-based neural architectures on a sentence similarity task. The results obtained show that the linguistically motivated compositional model is competitive with the neural attention-based models, while using a more transparent and interpretable architecture.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Compositionality - The principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent parts and the rules used to combine them. A key concept discussed and compared between neural and symbolic approaches.

- Selectional preferences - The semantic restrictions that words impose on other words they combine with. Used in the proposed compositional model to construct contextualized word senses. 

- Paradigmatic classes - Sets of words that can replace each other in a certain syntactic context. Used to represent selectional preferences in the compositional model.

- Attention mechanism - The mechanism used in neural models like Transformers to build contextualized word representations by allowing words to "attend" to other relevant words. Compared to the proposed compositional model.

- Interpretability - A desired property of semantic models. The proposed compositional model aims to be more interpretable than neural "black box" approaches.

- Dependency grammar - Provides the syntactic structure used in the proposed compositional model to incrementally build word senses.

- Contextualized word senses/vectors - Dynamic word representations that capture meaning in context. Constructed differently by the compositional and neural approaches.

So in summary, key terms cover the linguistic concepts used in the compositional model, the attention mechanism it's compared to, and broader concepts like interpretability and compositionality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that current neural network models lack transparency and explainability. Can you expand more on the specific issues with interpretability in models like BERT? What exactly makes them difficult to interpret?

2. The selectional preference and paradigmatic class approach is presented as an alternative compositional strategy. Can you walk through a detailed example of how this method builds the contextualized meaning of a sentence incrementally? 

3. The paper states that syntactic categories construct different conceptualizations and project different semantic representations. What evidence or prior theoretical work supports this view? How does this relate to the choice to build separate vector spaces for different parts of speech?

4. Explain the mathematical formalization of equations 1-4 in more detail. How exactly are the contextualized vectors computed from the static vectors and vectors representing the paradigmatic classes? 

5. The paper argues that paraphrasing classes allow for "alignment" of vector spaces. Unpack this concept more - why exactly do noun and verb vectors live in incompatible spaces and how does the use of paradigmatic classes resolve this?

6. Contrast the graphical depiction of the attention mechanism in Figure 1 versus the compositional architecture in Figure 2. What are the key differences in how contextualization occurs in these two models?

7. The paper states the approach is based on local lexical meaning and leaves out global meaning. What challenges arise from not representing global meaning? How might the model be extended to incorporate global meaning?

8. What role does the root word play in representing the overall meaning of the sentence in this compositional approach? How might the combination of contextualized senses be improved? 

9. The results show statistically significant differences between BERT and DepFunc. Analyze and interpret the specific results shown for English and across languages. What might account for the differences?

10. The conclusion sets out numerous areas for future work. Which of these seem the most critical? How might extensions to handling open syntax, referential expressions, non-compositional phrases etc. improve performance?
