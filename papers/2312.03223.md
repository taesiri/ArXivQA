# [Hierarchical RL-Guided Large-scale Navigation of a Snake Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03223)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a hierarchical control scheme for large-scale navigation of a snake robot named COBRA. The control scheme has four layers: global path planning to decompose the navigation into waypoints, local navigation between waypoints using a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to control central pattern generators (CPGs), gait generation from the CPGs to produce target joint trajectories, and low-level PID control to track the joint trajectories. The method leverages RL and CPGs to enable adaptive locomotion over complex terrain. It uses only on-robot sensing for learning without external motion capture. Through the global planning, the method can generalize directly to new environments without retraining the local policy. Simulations demonstrate COBRA navigating randomized mazes by sequencing basic motion primitives like sidewinding and turning. The results validate the approachâ€™s effectiveness for large-scale navigation. Also, training time is reduced by using CPGs rather than directly learning a policy in joint space. Overall, the hierarchical decomposition and learning scheme allows efficient deployment to new environments for the high degree-of-freedom COBRA robot.
