# [Cheetah: Natural Language Generation for 517 African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of natural language generation (NLG) resources and models for African languages, which poses challenges for supporting linguistic diversity. 
- Most existing NLG research has focused on high-resource languages like English and French, while African languages have been underserved.
- Developing NLG systems for African languages is difficult due to limited datasets, scarce linguistic research, and language variations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Cheetah, a massively multilingual language model designed to support 517 African languages and varieties. 
- Cheetah leverages a large 42GB multi-domain corpus across African languages for pretraining.
- The model utilizes a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with denoising auto-encoding objective.

Main Contributions:
- Cheetah supports the largest number of African languages (517) compared to prior work, enabling NLG for low-resource African languages.
- The paper proposes AfroNLG, a benchmark for evaluating African language generation with 7 task clusters across 527 languages.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate Cheetah's efficacy, outperforming existing multilingual models on 48/65 test sets and showing superior performance in human evaluations.  
- Analysis provides insights into Cheetah's linguistic capabilities for varying typological features of African languages regarding morphology, phonology and more.
- Cheetah promotes linguistic diversity, facilitates African language preservation, and bridges the digital divide.

In summary, the paper presents Cheetah, a massively multilingual model that advances NLG research for African languages by supporting 517 languages, demonstrating strong performance on the AfroNLG benchmark, and highlighting its capabilities through comprehensive analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Cheetah, a massively multilingual language model supporting 517 African languages, demonstrates its superior performance over other models across a range of generation tasks for African languages, and analyzes its capabilities in capturing key linguistic phenomena through manual evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors introduce Cheetah, a massively multilingual language model designed to support 517 African languages and language varieties. This is claimed to be the largest support for African languages in an NLP model to date.

2) The authors create a new benchmark called AfroNLG for evaluating natural language generation systems on African languages. AfroNLG includes datasets for tasks like machine translation, question answering, summarization, and paraphrase across 67 test sets and 527 languages.

3) Through experiments on AfroNLG, the authors demonstrate Cheetah's superior performance compared to other multilingual models like mT5 and mT0. Cheetah achieves state-of-the-art results on 48 out of the 65 test sets spanning seven task clusters.

4) The authors also conduct finer-grained human evaluations on Cheetah using controlled test sets. The results continue to demonstrate Cheetah's strengths in terms of faithfulness and fluency for translation into languages like Hausa, Swahili and Yoruba.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing the Cheetah model, the AfroNLG benchmark, demonstrating strong empirical performance of Cheetah on African languages using both automatic and human evaluation, and analysis of its linguistic capabilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Cheetah - The name of the massively multilingual language model developed in the paper to support natural language generation for 517 African languages.

- AfroNLG - The benchmark dataset created in the paper to evaluate African natural language generation models. It contains tasks like machine translation, summarization, question answering, etc across 67 test sets and 527 languages.

- Low-resource languages - The paper focuses on supporting natural language processing for African languages, many of which are considered low-resource due to lack of datasets and linguistic resources.

- Transfer learning - The technique of using a pretrained language model like T5 and fine-tuning it on African languages to allow them to better support tasks like summarization, translation etc.

- Multilinguality - The paper explores massively multilingual models that can support hundreds of languages in a single model through transfer learning.

- Encoder-decoder model - Cheetah is implemented using an encoder-decoder architecture with 12 layers in both the encoder and decoder.

- Pretraining objectives - The model uses a denoising self-supervised objective during pretraining where the input sentences are corrupted by masking/dropping some tokens.

- Benchmarking - Comprehensive evaluation of language generation capabilities across multiple tasks is done using the AfroNLG benchmark suite.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a denoising objective for pretraining Cheetah. Can you explain in more detail how this denoising objective works and why it was chosen over other pretraining objectives? 

2. Cheetah uses a vocabulary constructed with SentencePiece. What are some of the advantages of using SentencePiece for vocabulary creation compared to other options? How large is Cheetah's vocabulary?

3. The paper states that Cheetah was pretrained on over 40GB of data across 517 African languages. Can you describe the data collection process? What types of data sources were leveraged and how was data quality and coverage ensured?

4. One of the motivations for Cheetah is enabling natural language generation for low-resource African languages. In your view, what are some of the biggest challenges in developing NLG systems for such languages? How does Cheetah attempt to address these challenges?  

5. The paper introduces a new benchmark called AfroNLG for evaluating African language generation. What tasks does this benchmark include and what are some of its key attributes? How does it compare to previous benchmarks?

6. In the human evaluation, Cheetah is assessed on metrics like faithfulness and fluency on a controlled test set. Can you explain how these metrics are defined and why they are useful for evaluating generation quality?

7. What linguistic capabilities of Cheetah were analyzed through the human evaluation? Summarize some of the key findings from this analysis across languages like Hausa, Swahili and Yoruba. 

8. One limitation mentioned is the inability to perform extensive bias analysis on the pretraining data. In your view, why is this an important analysis to conduct? How might biases manifest in generated text?

9. Can you describe some potential use cases or applications where a multilingual NLG system like Cheetah could be beneficial? What kinds of tasks do you think it would be well suited or unsuited for?

10. The paper discusses how Cheetah aligns with the goals of Afrocentric NLP by focusing on African languages. In your opinion, what should be some priorities for future work in order to advance African-centered NLP research?
