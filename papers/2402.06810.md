# [Evaluating Co-Creativity using Total Information Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06810)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating creativity in musical co-creation like improvisation between humans/agents is challenging as it is a subjective process. 
- Existing methods rely on subjective assessments or quality metrics that don't measure the creativity of the process.
- The authors hypothesize that the amount of information flow between musicians is an indication of musical creativity.

Method:
- Propose a score to quantify co-creativity using information flow between two musical signals X and Y. 
- Information flow is computed as the sum of transfer entropy in both directions using terms like H(X|X_past).
- Use a pre-trained transformer model (MTMT) as an entropy estimator to compute these terms on long musical sequences.

Experiments:
- Analyze information flow trends on curated positive/negative samples from 2 datasets. Flow is higher for positive samples.
- Conduct user study comparing information flow and subjective quality/creativity scores. Aligns well. 
- Analyze positional and self-enhancement biases in the transformer model used.

Contributions:
- Novel creativity measure for musical co-creation based on information flow.
- Method to compute the score using pre-trained generative models on long sequences.
- Extensive analysis showing information flow matches human perception of musical creativity.

The paper tackles an important problem in evaluating creativity for musical improvisation types of tasks. The proposed information flow measure provides a quantitative way to do this based on information theory. The analysis and studies validate that the metric aligns well with subjective assessments.
