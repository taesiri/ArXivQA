# [SmallCap: Lightweight Image Captioning Prompted with Retrieval   Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15323)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be: 

How can retrieval-based prompting be used to create an efficient and lightweight image captioning model that can effectively leverage large amounts of unlabeled text data?

The authors propose a model called SmallCap which uses a prompt containing a few retrieved captions to condition the generation of a new caption for a given image. The key ideas explored in the paper are:

- Using retrieval to provide relevant captions as prompts allows the model itself to have very few trainable parameters, enabling lightweight and efficient training.

- The prompts provide useful conditioning context and knowledge, compensating for the small model size. 

- The retrieved captions come from an external datastore, which can be swapped or expanded without retraining the base model. This allows leveraging large unlabeled datasets in a training-free manner.

- The model can transfer to new domains/datasets simply by changing the contents of the datastore, without needing finetuning.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that retrieval-based prompting is an effective technique to create lightweight yet high-performing image captioning models that can exploit large unlabeled data in a training-free way and easily transfer across domains. The SmallCap model is proposed to validate this hypothesis.
