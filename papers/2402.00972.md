## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reliable simulations of critical real-world phenomena like weather, wildfires, and epidemics often rely on models described by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, fully resolving all scales in the PDEs with numerical simulations can be prohibitively expensive. As an alternative, coarse-grained simulations using lower resolutions and empirical closure models are frequently employed but have limitations in accuracy. The paper aims to develop a systematic approach for identifying closure models to improve the accuracy of coarse-grained PDE simulations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework called CNN-MARL to discover closure models that correct errors introduced by coarse-grained discretization of PDEs. 

In CNN-MARL, agents are placed at each grid point of the coarse simulation and take local actions to introduce a forcing term that compensates for the numerical error. The agents collectively learn a central policy represented by a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) that maps simulation states to actions. Locality serves as an inductive bias as each agent only observes information from neighboring grid points through the FCN architecture. 

The local reward signal for each agent is based on the difference between the coarse and associated fine grid simulation, incentivizing actions that improve accuracy. Adaptive truncation also helps stabilize training.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes a MARL framework to systematically identify closure models for under-resolved PDE simulations in a more general, automated manner compared to prior physics-specific approaches

- Utilizes locality and shared central policy architecture for efficient training with many agents 

- Achieves accurate predictions for both in-distribution and extrapolative test cases, indicating actual discovery of missing dynamics rather than just overfitting

- Demonstrates interpretable agent actions that strongly correlate with theoretical numerical error, effectively correcting the numerical discretization 

- Obtains speedup over fully resolved simulation by compressing some fine-scale computations

The capabilities and limitations of the method are analyzed through numerical experiments on the advection and viscous Burgers' equation.
