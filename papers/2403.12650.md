# [Adaptive Multilevel Neural Networks for Parametric PDEs with Error   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently solving high-dimensional parametric partial differential equations (pPDEs) that arise in various fields like engineering, environmental science, and finance. Specifically, it focuses on a class of parametric stationary diffusion (Darcy flow) problems with a potentially infinite-dimensional parameter space. The goal is to map parameters to corresponding PDE solutions quickly to enable exploration of different scenarios.

Proposed Solution
The paper proposes a neural network architecture constructed to map parameters of a PDE model to finite element solutions on locally refined grids. The architecture mimics an adaptive finite element method (AFEM) by outputting a coarse grid solution and successive corrections that reduce the error, allowing tracking of approximation errors over layers. 

The AFEM iteratively solves, estimates error, marks elements for refinement, and refines grids based on an efficient and reliable a posteriori error estimator. Solutions at each level are discretized in a hierarchical basis suitable for handling sparse images from finely discretized meshes.

The neural network architecture uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The coarse grid solver and error corrections are modeled by separate CNN blocks. Estimated errors and marked elements for refinement are additional outputs that can guide adaptive sampling and network sizing.

Main Contributions
- CNN architecture incorporating ideas from AFEM and multilevel FEM discretization to enable efficient and accurate solutions even for finely discretized grids
- Explicit tracking of error reductions over network layers based on reliable estimator
- Problem-adapted representation of solution on locally refined grids with fewer parameters
- Leveraging sparsity in hierarchical basis and corrections in deeper layers to improve efficiency

The architecture is described and initial numerical results on a test Darcy flow problem with fixed refined grids are presented. Next steps include testing on fully adaptive grids, further analysis of the architecture, and derivation of expressivity results.
