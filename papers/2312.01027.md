# [Taming Latent Diffusion Models to See in the Dark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01027)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Taming Latent Diffusion Models to See in the Dark":

Problem:
- Enhancing low-light noisy RAW images into well-exposed and clean sRGB images is challenging due to noise and lack of paired training data. 
- Existing methods suffer from artifacts and remaining noise when enhancing extremely dark regions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new low-light image enhancement (LLIE) method called LDM-SID that tames a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) to exploit its generative priors.
- Apply 2D discrete wavelet transform on input to get low-freq (structural content) and high-freq (details) subbands.
- Insert trainable taming modules to modulate LDM's intermediate features using low-freq subband. This steers LDM to generate structural latent representations.
- Insert separate taming modules to modulate decoder features using both low-freq (scale) and high-freq (shift) subbands. This maintains precise details in final output.
- Only train the inserted taming modules while keeping pre-trained LDM/decoder frozen.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a simple yet effective way to exploit generative priors of a frozen pre-trained diffusion model for LLIE instead of training one from scratch.
- Apply 2D discrete wavelet transform to divide LLIE into low-freq content generation and high-freq detail maintenance, allowing skillful exploitation of dedicated generative priors in different portions of diffusion model. 
- Taming modules modulated by frequency subbands enable optimized balance between fidelity and perceptual quality.
- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance, with clear structural content and detail enhancement in extremely dark regions.
