# [Generative Pretraining in Multimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05222)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can large multimodal models be better trained to handle diverse forms of multimodal data under a unified objective, in order to serve as versatile interfaces for various vision-language tasks involving both image and text modalities?

The key hypotheses proposed in the paper appear to be:

1) Videos with subtitles present a promising yet overlooked source of interleaved multimodal data that can be incorporated in pretraining, in addition to commonly used image-text pairs and interleaved documents.

2) Training the model under a unified objective of predicting the next visual or textual token in an autoregressive manner, instead of only predicting text tokens, will empower it with stronger multimodality and the ability to serve as a generalist interface.

3) The model trained this way can effectively perform diverse tasks involving completion in multimodal sequences, including image captioning, VQA, text-to-image generation etc. It can also demonstrate new abilities like in-context image generation and blending.

So in summary, the central focus is on exploring better pretraining objectives and data to build large multimodal models as versatile interfaces, with videos as a new data source. The key hypotheses are around the benefits of unified next-token prediction and incorporating videos for pretraining such generalist multimodal models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the abstract, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Presenting Emu, a Transformer-based multimodal foundation model that can seamlessly generate images and text in multimodal context. Emu is trained to take in any single-modality or multimodal data input indiscriminately (e.g. interleaved image, text and video) through a unified autoregressive training process. 

2. Exploring videos as a new source of interleaved image-text data for pretraining multimodal models, in addition to commonly used image-text pairs and documents. 

3. Pretraining Emu with a unified objective of predicting the next visual or text token in a multimodal sequence, instead of just predicting the next text token like most prior work. This allows supervision for both the visual and textual parts.

4. Demonstrating that the resulting Emu model serves as a generalist multimodal interface for diverse vision-language tasks including image/video understanding, image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation. It shows strong zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to prior arts.

5. Showing additional capabilities of Emu like multimodal assistants via instruction tuning, in-context image generation, and image blending.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Emu model that is trained in a unified multimodal way on diverse data, and serves as a versatile interface for multimodal tasks while showing strong performance. The unique training process and exploration of videos as pretraining data are key aspects.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes Emu, a Transformer-based multimodal foundation model that can generate images and text in a unified framework by taking in interleaved multimodal input and predicting the next visual or textual element, achieving strong performance on diverse vision-language tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multimodal generative modeling:

- Data - This work explores a new data source (YouTube videos with subtitles) that provides a large amount of naturally interleaved multimodal data. Most prior work has focused on image-text pairs or documents with embedded images. Using videos allows the model to learn stronger cross-modal correlations.

- Objective - The paper proposes a unified autoregressive predictive objective over both visual and textual tokens. Many prior models have only predicted text tokens and not exerted supervision over the visual data. By modeling both modalities equally, the approach allows for a generalist interface.

- Architecture - The proposed architecture connects a visual encoder, causal transformer, multimodal modeling Transformer, and visual decoder in an end-to-end framework. This is fairly similar to other recent LMM architectures like BLIP and Flamingo. The distinction here is using the causal transformer over the visual data.

- Multimodality - A key advantage claimed is the ability to handle interleaved multimodal data as both input and output. Most other models specialize as either image->text or text->image. The proposed model can generate images conditioned on text and vice versa.

- Evaluation - The model is evaluated across a broad range of multimodal tasks including QA, captioning, generative modeling. The large model size and unified pretraining appear to provide strong generalization.

Overall, the work seems like an incremental improvement over recent large multimodal models, with the main novelties being use of a new video+text data source and end-to-end predictive pretraining objective. The results demonstrate these contribute to improved performance, but the gains are modest over the state-of-the-art. The framework for handling generic interleaved multimodal data is powerful but remains to be explored more deeply.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring other forms of multimodal data beyond image-text pairs and video-text pairs, such as audio-text data, 3D data, etc. The authors suggest continuing to explore the potential of diverse multimodal data at web-scale.

- Improving the image generation capability of the model, for example by using a different visual decoder instead of finetuning a pretrained diffusion model. The authors believe there is room for improvement on the image generation side.

- Applying the model to more complex reasoning tasks and evaluating on more challenging benchmarks to continue pushing the state-of-the-art.

- Combining retrieval mechanisms with the generative capabilities of the model. The authors suggest exploring retrieval augmented generative modeling.

- Extending the instruction tuning approach to more complex instructions and exploring other human-AI alignment techniques. 

- Exploring generative pretraining objectives beyond autoregressive modeling, such as masked or bidirectional modeling.

- Scaling up the model size and pretraining data further to continue improving capabilities.

In summary, the key future directions are exploring new modalities and data sources, improving image generation, applying to more complex tasks, combining retrieval with generation, advancing human-AI alignment, scaling up model size and data, and researching alternative pretraining objectives. The authors lay out an extensive research agenda for advancing multimodal foundations models.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Emu, a large multimodal model based on a Transformer architecture. Emu is trained on diverse multimodal data including image-text pairs, documents with interleaved images and text, and videos with subtitles. The key contribution is a unified training objective that predicts the next token, whether it is text or a visual embedding. Emu converts visual inputs to causal embeddings using a Causal Transformer module.

Emu serves as a general interface for multimodal tasks, supporting text-to-image and image-to-text generation. It demonstrates strong zero-shot and few-shot performance on tasks like image captioning, visual QA, and text-to-image generation. Emu also shows qualitative abilities like real-world knowledge grounding, detailed video understanding, multimodal dialog, and in-context learning. An instruction-tuned version of Emu builds an impressive multimodal assistant aligned with human instructions. Overall, the unified modeling and diverse training data enable Emu to serve as a versatile multimodal foundation model.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Emu, a Transformer-based multimodal foundation model that can generate images and text in multimodal context. Emu is trained on diverse multimodal data sources including images, text, and videos. It uses a unified autoregressive training process where it tries to predict the next token, which can be either a text token or a visual embedding. 

Emu demonstrates strong performance on a variety of multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation.

Quantitatively Emu outperforms prior work on benchmarks spanning image captioning, VQA, dialog and text-to-image generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the given paper:

The paper presents Emu, a large multimodal model built on top of a transformer-based language model. Emu is trained to model interleaved sequences containing both image embeddings and text tokens in an autoregressive manner, with the objective of predicting the next element in the sequence, whether it is a text token or visual embedding. To enable this, images are first encoded into dense embeddings using a pretrained vision encoder. These visual embeddings are then transformed into a fixed number of causal embeddings using a proposed Causal Transformer module. The causal visual embeddings are interleaved with text tokens to form the training sequences. Emu is trained end-to-end to predict the next token in these multimodal sequences, using a classification loss for text tokens and regression loss for the continuous visual embeddings. This unified autoregressive training allows Emu to serve as a generalist multimodal interface that can complete diverse vision-language tasks involving both image and text generation. Emu is pretrained on large-scale web data containing diverse forms of interleaved multimodal sequences, including documents, image-text pairs, videos with subtitles etc. After pretraining, a visual decoder is finetuned to transform the regressed visual embeddings into realistic images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problems and questions the authors are addressing include:

1) How to develop a large multimodal model (LMM) that can effectively handle and seamlessly generate across both image and text modalities, unlike many previous LMMs that focus primarily on text generation. 

2) How to incorporate video data as a new source of interleaved multimodal pretraining data, in addition to commonly used image-text pairs and documents. Videos provide a rich and scalable source of paired visual and textual data.

3) How to pretrain a model using a unified objective that accounts for loss on both visual and textual elements, rather than just focusing on text generation commonly done in LMMs. They propose a predict-the-next loss on both discrete text tokens and continuous visual embeddings.

4) Evaluating whether this unified pretraining approach and incorporation of video data allows the model to serve as an effective generalist multimodal interface for diverse vision-language tasks involving both image-to-text and text-to-image generation.

5) Exploring how instruction tuning can further enhance the model's capabilities as a multimodal assistant that can follow human instructions across modalities.

In summary, the key focus is developing and evaluating a versatile LMM that can handle multiple modalities in a unified manner thanks to its unique pretraining approach and data.
