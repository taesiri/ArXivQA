# [BBDM: Image-to-image Translation with Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07680)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop an effective image-to-image translation method using diffusion models based on Brownian bridge processes rather than conditional generation? 

The key hypothesis is that modeling image-to-image translation as a stochastic Brownian bridge process between two image domains, rather than as a conditional generation process, will allow for more effective and direct translation without issues caused by conditional information leverage.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework called BBDM (Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model) that uses bidirectional Brownian bridge processes to directly learn translations between image domains, avoiding conditional generation. The central hypothesis is that this approach will enable higher quality and more flexible image-to-image translation compared to existing conditional diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel image-to-image translation method based on Brownian Bridge diffusion process. Specifically:

1. It proposes to model image-to-image translation as a stochastic Brownian Bridge process rather than a conditional generation process. This avoids the issue of conditional information leakage in existing conditional diffusion models. 

2. It is the first work that introduces Brownian Bridge diffusion process for image-to-image translation. A new schedule of variance is designed to make the training feasible.

3. The proposed BBDM method learns the mapping between two domains directly through the bidirectional diffusion process. It does not require the conditional input being fed into the model during sampling like previous conditional diffusion models.

4. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate BBDM can achieve competitive performance on different image-to-image translation tasks through both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel way to perform image-to-image translation using Brownian Bridge diffusion process, which avoids the limitations of previous conditional diffusion models. The effectiveness of BBDM is validated on various tasks.
