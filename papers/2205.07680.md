# [BBDM: Image-to-image Translation with Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07680)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop an effective image-to-image translation method using diffusion models based on Brownian bridge processes rather than conditional generation? 

The key hypothesis is that modeling image-to-image translation as a stochastic Brownian bridge process between two image domains, rather than as a conditional generation process, will allow for more effective and direct translation without issues caused by conditional information leverage.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework called BBDM (Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model) that uses bidirectional Brownian bridge processes to directly learn translations between image domains, avoiding conditional generation. The central hypothesis is that this approach will enable higher quality and more flexible image-to-image translation compared to existing conditional diffusion models.
