# [M^3RS: Multi-robot, Multi-objective, and Multi-mode Routing and   Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of multi-robot routing and scheduling where each task can be executed in multiple modes. Different execution modes have distinct resource consumption, service times, and quality. Existing literature on multi-robot task allocation explores trade-offs between different objectives by varying task assignments, but does not consider using multiple execution modes. The paper proposes a novel formulation called Multi-robot, Multi-objective, Multi-mode Routing, and Scheduling (M3RS) to address this gap.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for M3RS that determines:
1) Task allocation to robots 
2) Transition of robots between tasks
3) Selection of execution mode for each task-robot allocation

The formulation maximizes a scalarized objective function representing user-specified trade-offs between multiple criteria that depend on selected execution modes. It incorporates various constraints like capacity, time windows, sub-tour elimination, etc. 

To address computational challenges for larger instances, a column generation approach is proposed. It decomposes the problem into a master problem that identifies optimal candidate solutions and a sub-problem that generates new solutions.

The utility of M3RS allowing flexible quality-time-resource trade-offs is shown through synthetic experiments and case studies in multi-robot disinfection application with objectives of maximizing disinfected areas and disinfection quality.

Main Contributions:
- A new formulation (M3RS) for multi-robot routing and scheduling that allows each task to be executed in multiple modes with distinct quality/resource/time implications
- An MILP model and column generation method to efficiently solve the proposed formulation
- Demonstrating the application of M3RS for efficient multi-robot disinfection operations allowing flexible trade-offs

The key novelty is in using multiple execution modes to explore various trade-offs unlike prior multi-robot task allocation literature. Experiments showcase the flexibility and performance benefits of M3RS over fixed execution modes.
