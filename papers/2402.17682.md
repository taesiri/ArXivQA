# [NextLevelBERT: Investigating Masked Language Modeling with Higher-Level   Representations for Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17682)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional language models like BERT struggle to process long sequences like books due to the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes NextLevelBERT, a masked language model that operates on vector representations of text chunks rather than individual tokens. 
- Text chunks (e.g. sentences) are encoded independently into vectors using a pretrained encoder model. Some chunk vectors are then masked and NextLevelBERT is trained to predict them based on the surrounding context.  
- This allows modeling language at a higher, more abstract level compared to individual tokens. NextLevelBERT can capture dependencies across much longer contexts.

Key Details:
- Text chunks are encoded with a frozen pretrained encoder like MiniLM and packed together into sequences. 
- 15% of chunk vectors are masked, using BERT's masking strategy. An MLP predicts the original vectors.  
- NextLevelBERT is pretrained on a large dataset of books to reconstruct masked chunk vectors.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel method for masked language modeling at the level of text chunk representations rather than tokens
- Develops NextLevelBERT architecture and pretraining procedure  
- Shows strong performance on long document tasks like semantic similarity, classification and QA
- Demonstrates that next level MLM leads to useful document vectors and long-range modeling
- Provides an efficient way to handle long sequences compared to token-level models

The summary covers the key details on the problem being addressed, the proposed NextLevelBERT solution, its architecture and pretraining, the main results showing its effectiveness on various long document tasks, and the main contributions of modeling language on vector chunks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

NextLevelBERT is a masked language model that operates on vector representations of text chunks instead of individual tokens, enabling it to efficiently process much longer documents while still capturing semantic patterns and long-range dependencies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing NextLevelBERT, a masked language model that operates on higher-level semantic representations (text embeddings of sentences or text chunks) rather than on individual tokens. Specifically:

- They apply masked language modeling in a novel way on text embeddings and pretrain NextLevelBERT on a large collection of very long documents. 

- The model learns to predict masked text chunk representations based on surrounding context chunks. This results in contextualized chunk vectors and meaningful long document representations.

- They demonstrate NextLevelBERT's effectiveness on three diverse long document tasks: semantic textual similarity, document classification, and multiple choice QA.

- They show that next level masked language pretraining is an effective technique for long document modeling and can outperform much larger models, as long as the required level of detail is not too high.

- The model uses only a third as many parameters as the strongest competitor model, while showcasing stronger performance on certain tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a method for applying masked language modeling to text embeddings instead of tokens, enabling more effective modeling of long documents.

- Masked language modeling (MLM) - The pretraining technique used to train NextLevelBERT, adapted to work on sentence embeddings rather than tokens.

- Text chunks/embeddings - The semantic representations of spans of text that serve as the inputs and targets for NextLevelBERT's MLM pretraining. Encoded independently using a pretrained model.

- Long documents - A key application area and motivation for NextLevelBERT, as it can process much longer effective sequence lengths compared to token-based models.

- Hierarchical modeling - NextLevelBERT incorporates a two-level hierarchy with a text encoder and the NextLevelBERT model operating on the resulting chunk vectors.

- Semantic textual similarity - One of the downstream tasks used to evaluate NextLevelBERT's document representations.

- Document classification - Another downstream application area tested with NextLevelBERT.

- Question answering - Specifically multiple choice QA, tested on the QuALITY benchmark.
