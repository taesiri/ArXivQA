# [A bi-objective $Îµ$-constrained framework for quality-cost   optimization in language model ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) have high inference costs, limiting their deployment in high-throughput applications.  
- Open-source LLMs are less expensive but have lower quality responses compared to proprietary models.  
- Naively ensembling multiple LLMs improves quality but significantly increases costs due to multiple model invocations.

Proposed Solution  
- Formulate a bi-objective optimization problem to model the tradeoff between response quality and inference cost.
- Introduce a budget constraint to transform it into a 0/1 knapsack problem, allowing efficient selection of subset of models.  
- Propose MODI framework that uses a DeBERTa regressor to predict quality of LLM responses to guide knapsack model selection.
- Employ GEN-FUSER model to aggregate responses from selected models.

Key Contributions
- Novel framework to optimize multi-objective function representing quality-cost tradeoff in LLM ensembling.  
- Demonstrate superior response quality compared to baselines at fraction of cost of naive ensemble.
- Establish a foundation for cost-effective strategies to enhance LLM capabilities through ensembling techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient and affordable LLM ensembling approach that leverages open-source models to provide high quality responses while significantly reducing inference costs compared to prior art. The bi-objective optimization set up and budget constraint are key innovations enabling quality-cost optimization.
