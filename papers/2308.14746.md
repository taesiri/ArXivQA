# [CoVR: Learning Composed Video Retrieval from Web Video Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14746)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently train composed video retrieval (CoVR) models when composed video-text-video triplets are not available. The key hypothesis is that such triplets can be automatically generated from existing video-caption pairs by mining similar videos through their captions, and using a trained language model to generate modification text describing their differences. The automatically generated triplets can then be used to train CoVR models, despite being noisy.

The main contributions stemming from this hypothesis are:

1) A scalable automatic triplet generation methodology by mining similar videos and generating modification text. 

2) Applying this methodology to create a large-scale CoVR training set (WebVid-CoVR) with 1.6M triplets.

3) Showing that models trained on the automatic WebVid-CoVR transfer well to composed image retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot results on CIRR and FashionIQ.

4) Creating a new benchmark for evaluating CoVR by manually annotating a subset of triplets.

In summary, the central research question is how to train composed retrieval models without expensive manual annotation of triplets, which is addressed through automatic triplet generation and training models on the resulting noisy data. The key hypothesis is that this can work well despite the noise, as evidenced by strong transfer results to image retrieval tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposes a scalable approach to automatically generate training data for composed video retrieval (CoVR). This is done by mining similar video-caption pairs from a large dataset and using a trained language model to generate modification text describing their differences. 

2. Applies this data generation pipeline to the WebVid2M dataset to construct a large-scale CoVR training dataset called WebVid-CoVR with 1.6M triplets.

3. Shows that training a CoVR model on WebVid-CoVR transfers well to composed image retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot results on CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks.

4. Introduces a new benchmark for CoVR called WebVid-CoVR-Test with 2.5K manually annotated triplets, along with baseline results.

In summary, the main contribution is an automatic and scalable approach to generate training data for composed visual retrieval. This enables training models that transfer well to image retrieval tasks while also providing a new benchmark for the video retrieval setting. The large-scale WebVid-CoVR dataset is a key asset enabling these advances.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an automatic methodology to generate large-scale training data for composed video retrieval by mining similar video pairs from web data and generating modification text between them using a trained language model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work in composed image/video retrieval:

- The paper focuses on a new task of composed video retrieval (CoVR), while most prior work has focused on composed image retrieval (CoIR). CoVR extends CoIR to dynamically changing video content.

- The key challenge tackled is generating training data of video-text-video triplets. Most prior CoIR methods use manually annotated small-scale datasets. This paper instead develops an automatic pipeline to generate triplets from weakly labeled video-caption pairs.

- The automatic triplet generation methodology mines similar video pairs based on caption similarity and generates modification text using a trained language model. This allows creating a large-scale CoVR dataset from existing video corpora. 

- The resulting 1.6M triplets \ourDS dataset is significantly larger than prior CoIR datasets like CIRR and FashionIQ which have 30-40K queries. The concurrent LaSCo dataset has 389K queries but uses expensive VQA annotations.

- For model training, a contrastive loss is used to handle noise in the automatic dataset generation process. The model adapts BLIP to the CoVR task using query scoring over multiple target video frames.

- Experiments show the model trained on the generated CoVR data transfers well to CoIR, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot results on CIRR and FashionIQ. This demonstrates the generalization of the proposed approach.

- A new CoVR test benchmark \ourDSm is introduced with 2.4K manually verified triplets, along with baseline experiments.

Overall, the key novelty is in automatic training data generation at scale for composed retrieval. The results demonstrate this can transfer well to related tasks while avoiding expensive manual annotation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Incorporating visually grounded modification text generation and allowing for multiple modifications between the query and target videos. The current approach focuses on single word differences between captions, so allowing for more complex multi-word differences could improve the quality and diversity of the generated triplets. 

- Exploring different architectures and training objectives for the composed video retrieval model beyond the BLIP baseline used in this work. The authors mention potentially using other recently proposed vision-language models as a starting point.

- Applying the automatic triplet generation methodology to other large-scale video-caption datasets beyond WebVid. This could create composed video retrieval training data in different domains.

- Evaluating on additional composed video retrieval benchmarks beyond the manually curated test set introduced in this paper. As interest in this new task grows, larger benchmarks with more diversity would help further assess model capabilities.

- Studying the video temporal dynamics more closely. The current work uses multiple uniformly sampled frames, but modeling the temporal evolution could be beneficial.

- Extending composed retrieval to take video queries instead of just image queries, as the authors provide preliminary experiments for. More thorough investigation of video-to-video retrieval through this compositional formulation could be impactful.

- Leveraging the composed training data to pre-train models for transfer learning to other vision-language tasks. The authors show promising transfer results on the composed image retrieval task, but more tasks could be considered.

In summary, the authors point to improving the quality and scale of the training data generation, exploring modeling enhancements for the composed video retrieval task itself, and transferring the learned representations to other problems as interesting future directions to build on this work.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable approach to automatically generate training data for composed video retrieval (CoVR). They first mine similar video-caption pairs from a large dataset by identifying captions that differ by only one word. Then, they train a modification text generation language model (MTG-LLM) on manually annotated text triplets to generate a descriptive modification text between the paired captions. By applying this MTG-LLM to automatically mined caption pairs, they obtain video-text-video triplets that can be used to train a CoVR model without needing manually annotated video triplets. They demonstrate this methodology by generating a large CoVR training set from the WebVid2M dataset, and show the dataset's effectiveness by training a CoVR model that achieves strong transfer performance on composed image retrieval benchmarks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of composed video retrieval (CoVR). CoVR involves retrieving videos from a database using a query that consists of both an image and a text description. The text typically specifies some modification or change to the query image to retrieve a relevant video. 

The key challenge addressed is generating suitable training data consisting of image/text/video triplets for learning a CoVR model, since manually collecting such triplets is difficult and not scalable.

The main contributions of the paper are:

1) Proposing a scalable automatic approach to generate training triplets from existing video-caption pairs. This involves mining similar video pairs based on caption similarity, and using a trained language model to generate modification text between the captions. 

2) Applying this approach to a large web video dataset (WebVid2M) to generate a new CoVR training set called WebVid-CoVR with 1.6M triplets.

3) Showing that training a model on this dataset transfers well to standard composed image retrieval tasks, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot results.

4) Creating a new CoVR benchmark dataset called WebVid-CoVR-Test with manually verified triplets for evaluation.

So in summary, the paper is proposing a way to automatically create training data for the new task of composed video retrieval, since collecting such data manually does not scale. This enables training models for the CoVR task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an automatic approach to generate training data for composed video retrieval (CoVR). Could you elaborate more on why existing datasets like CIRR and FashionIQ are not suitable for training CoVR models? What are the key advantages of automatic generation over manual annotation?

2. The core idea is to mine similar video pairs by pairing captions that differ by only one word. How did you determine that a one-word difference is the optimal criteria? Did you experiment with other similarity thresholds (e.g. allowing more word differences, using different text similarity metrics etc)? 

3. For generating the modification text, you finetune a large language model (LLM) on a small manually annotated text dataset with only 715 examples. What motivated this decision rather than simply prompting the LLM? How much does finetuning the LLM improve results over the prompting baseline?

4. When filtering the generated data, you exclude caption pairs that are too similar or dissimilar based on CLIP similarity thresholds. How were these threshold values determined? Did you experiment with different ranges or adaptive thresholds per caption?

5. The paper shows steady improvements as more seed video-caption pairs are used for generation. What factors limit further scaling? At what point do you expect diminishing returns on generation quality or model performance?

6. When training the CoVR model, you iterate over target videos instead of triplets in each batch. Why is this beneficial compared to standard triplet sampling? Does it lead to a significant increase in unique negatives per batch?

7. How exactly does the query scoring using BLIP embeddings work? Does computing query-specific weights per target video frame provide better retrieval than simple averaging?

8. One limitation mentioned is generating only single-word modifications from the caption pairs. How can the approach be extended to generate more complex, multi-word differences? Does this require changes to the MTG-LLM training?

9. The qualitative examples show high diversity but also some noise in the generated data. What error analyses did you perform to understand the primary sources of noise? What steps could be taken to filter bad examples more effectively?

10. The paper demonstrates strong zero-shot transfer of the CoVR model to image retrieval on CIRR and FashionIQ. What factors do you think enable this cross-domain generalization? Does finetuning on the target dataset lead to further improvements?
