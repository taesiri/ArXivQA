# [Jamba: A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers have high memory/compute requirements and struggle with long contexts due to large key-value caches. 
- RNNs summarize long contexts in a single state but struggle with long-distance relationships and slow training.
- Recent state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba are more efficient but lag in performance compared to Transformers.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Jamba, a novel hybrid Transformer-Mamba mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture.
- Interleave blocks of Transformer and Mamba layers to balance benefits of both families.
- Add MoE to some layers to increase model capacity while keeping active usage small.

Contributions:
- Flexible architecture allowing optimization for different resources and objectives.
- 7B parameter Jamba implementation fits 80GB GPU, supports 256K token contexts.
- Comparable performance to state-of-the-art Transformers like Mixtral-8x7B and Llama-2 70B.  
- Much higher throughput than Mixtral/Llama-2, especially for long contexts (up to 3x).
- Strong results even for 256K token contexts, best publicly available model.
- Analysis of design choices like Transformer/Mamba layer ratio, MoE configuration. 
- Insights like Mamba's struggles with in-context learning, need for specialized normalization.
- Publicly released base Jamba model to encourage exploration of this new architecture.

In summary, Jamba demonstrates hybrid Transformer-SSM models can reach state-of-the-art quality with improved efficiency, especially for long contexts. The analysis and public release aim to spur further work on optimizing such hybrid architectures.
