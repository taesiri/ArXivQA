# [Semantically Enriched Cross-Lingual Sentence Embeddings for   Crisis-related Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models like BERT lack semantically meaningful sentence embeddings for crisis-related social media texts. This is an issue for tasks like semantic search and clustering.
- Existing crisis-specific sentence encoder (CrisisTransformers) is monolingual, only supporting English. Social media posts during crises can be multilingual. 
- Using separate models for different languages leads to embeddings in distinct spaces. This makes comparing semantic similarity of multilingual sentences difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two multilingual sentence encoders - CT-XLMR-SE and CT-mBERT-SE to embed crisis-related texts from 52 languages into a shared vector space.
- Use a student-teacher training architecture with CrisisTransformers sentence encoder as teacher and XLM-R, mBERT as students.
- Train students on 128 million parallel sentence pairs from 10 datasets to mimic teacher's embedding space.

Main Contributions:
- First ever multilingual sentence encoders for crisis texts spanning 52 languages.
- Publicly released encoders to serve as robust baselines for tasks involving multilingual crisis texts.
- Evaluation on sentence encoding and matching tasks shows models generalize well across languages and approximate teacher's space.
- Discussion on applications in semantic search, clustering, topic modeling to gain insights from multilingual crisis texts.

In summary, the paper introduces cross-lingual sentence encoders to address current limitations and produce unified embeddings for multilingual crisis-related texts. The released encoders can enable more comprehensive analysis of social media discourse during crises.
