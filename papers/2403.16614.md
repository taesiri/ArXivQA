# [Semantically Enriched Cross-Lingual Sentence Embeddings for   Crisis-related Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models like BERT lack semantically meaningful sentence embeddings for crisis-related social media texts. This is an issue for tasks like semantic search and clustering.
- Existing crisis-specific sentence encoder (CrisisTransformers) is monolingual, only supporting English. Social media posts during crises can be multilingual. 
- Using separate models for different languages leads to embeddings in distinct spaces. This makes comparing semantic similarity of multilingual sentences difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two multilingual sentence encoders - CT-XLMR-SE and CT-mBERT-SE to embed crisis-related texts from 52 languages into a shared vector space.
- Use a student-teacher training architecture with CrisisTransformers sentence encoder as teacher and XLM-R, mBERT as students.
- Train students on 128 million parallel sentence pairs from 10 datasets to mimic teacher's embedding space.

Main Contributions:
- First ever multilingual sentence encoders for crisis texts spanning 52 languages.
- Publicly released encoders to serve as robust baselines for tasks involving multilingual crisis texts.
- Evaluation on sentence encoding and matching tasks shows models generalize well across languages and approximate teacher's space.
- Discussion on applications in semantic search, clustering, topic modeling to gain insights from multilingual crisis texts.

In summary, the paper introduces cross-lingual sentence encoders to address current limitations and produce unified embeddings for multilingual crisis-related texts. The released encoders can enable more comprehensive analysis of social media discourse during crises.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces two new multilingual sentence encoder models, CT-XLMR-SE and CT-mBERT-SE, trained on crisis-related texts across 52 languages to generate semantically meaningful cross-lingual embeddings for texts with similar meanings to be mapped close together in a common vector space, irrespective of linguistic diversity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of two multi-lingual sentence encoders (CT-XLMR-SE and CT-mBERT-SE) that can embed crisis-related social media texts for over 50 languages into a common semantic vector space. 

2. The public release of these sentence encoders to serve as robust baselines for tasks involving embedding of multi-lingual crisis-related texts.

In the authors' own words from the introduction section:

"In general, this study contributes the following to the existing crisis informatics literature:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We introduce two multi-lingual sentence encoders (CT-XLMR-SE and CT-mBERT-SE) that embed crisis-related social media texts for over 50 languages, such that texts with similar meanings are in close proximity within the same vector space, irrespective of language diversity.
    \item We publicly release the sentence encoders, making them easily accessible for integration with the Transformers library. We anticipate that these sentence encoders will serve as robust baselines for tasks that involve embedding multi-lingual crisis-related social media texts."
\end{itemize}

So in summary, the main contributions are the introduction and public release of the first cross-lingual sentence encoders specifically for crisis-related texts across 50+ languages.

The paper introduces two new multi-lingual sentence encoder models called CT-XLMR-SE and CT-mBERT-SE that are designed to embed crisis-related social media texts from over 50 languages into a common vector space. The key focus is on developing cross-lingual capabilities for embedding crisis texts to support tasks like semantic search, clustering, and topic modeling. The models build on existing work like CrisisTransformers and use a student-teacher training approach on parallel datasets. So the key terms reflect this focus on sentence encoders, multi-lingual models, crisis domains, and downstream applications.
