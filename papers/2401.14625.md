# [Toward Practical Automatic Speech Recognition and Post-Processing: a   Call for Explainable Error Benchmark Guideline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR) outputs are used downstream and impact end-user satisfaction. Thus diagnosing and enhancing vulnerabilities in ASR models is important. 
- However, traditional ASR evaluation methodologies only provide a single composite metric (e.g. WER, CER) which fails to give insight into specific weaknesses.
- This lack of granular detail also extends to the post-processing stage, resulting in further obfuscation of potential problems. 
- There is an inherent trade-off between recognition accuracy and user-friendliness that needs to be handled.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose developing an Error Explainable Benchmark (EEB) dataset that enables understanding ASR weaknesses at both the speech-level (accuracy) and text-level (user-friendliness).
- This involves defining detailed error taxonomies encompassing both noisy environments and speaker characteristics (24 sub-types) for speech-level and various linguistic error categories (13 sub-types) for text-level.
- They suggest modifying an existing Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) dataset to construct the benchmark by validating, recording speech, synthesizing noise and tagging difficulty level.  

Main Contributions:
- First guidelines aimed at benchmark development considering both speech- and text-aspects of ASR systems to enable more real-world centered evaluation.  
- Novel speech-level error taxonomy based on noisy environments and speaker traits as well as text-level error taxonomy tailored to speech recognition situations.
- Outlining a systematic process for construction of the EEB benchmark by leveraging GEC datasets, encompassing multiple quality assurance stages.
- The resulting dataset and methodology would allow detecting and correcting nuanced ASR system vulnerabilities to improve user experience.

In summary, the paper introduces comprehensive taxonomies and guidelines for developing a granular speech recognition benchmark that can explain model weaknesses considering both recognition accuracy and user-friendliness, enabling better diagnosis and enhancement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes guidelines for constructing an Error Explainable Benchmark dataset that considers detailed error types at both the speech and text levels to enable more accurate diagnosis and validation of automatic speech recognition systems and post-processors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing guidelines for constructing an Error Explainable Benchmark (EEB) dataset that can help diagnose and validate automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and post-processors. Specifically:

- They propose a detailed classification of error types at both the speech level (e.g. background noise, speaker characteristics) and text level (e.g. spacing, punctuation, spelling errors) to enable fine-grained analysis of where models are struggling. 

- They outline a process for efficiently constructing a dataset using these error types, by validating an existing grammatical error correction dataset, having humans record speech samples, synthesizing background noise, and having the data difficulty annotated. 

- The resulting EEB dataset would allow benchmarking ASR and post-processing models in a way that is explanatory and considers the tradeoffs between recognition accuracy and user-friendliness. This could better approximate performance in real-world conditions compared to traditional automatic evaluation metrics.

In summary, the key contribution is a guideline for building a novel benchmark that can provide greater insight into ASR model weaknesses through fine-grained error analysis spanning both the speech and text domain.

- Difficulty annotation

The paper proposes guidelines for constructing an "Error Explainable Benchmark" (EEB) dataset that carefully defines and categorizes different types of errors that can occur in ASR systems, considering both the accuracy of the speech recognition as well as the readability/user-friendliness of the output text. It aims to create a benchmark that can better diagnose weaknesses of ASR and ASRP systems by providing more fine-grained error explainability through its multi-level taxonomy of error types. The construction process utilizes an existing GEC dataset as a basis and incorporates speaker recordings, background noise synthesis, and difficulty judgments by human annotators. So the key focus is on benchmarking, error analysis, and dataset creation for ASR and ASRP systems.
