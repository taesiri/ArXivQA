# [CRAFT: Concept Recursive Activation FacTorization for Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10154)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- Can concept-based explanations provide more useful and interpretable explanations of model decisions compared to attribution methods? The authors hypothesize that concept-based methods can overcome limitations of attribution maps by explaining "what" visual features a model sees rather "where" it looks.

- Can concepts be discovered automatically from a model's activations without requiring additional supervision or labeling? The authors propose their CRAFT method to extract interpretable concepts via factorization of activations.

- Can concepts be extracted at the right level of abstraction by recursively applying factorization at different layers? The authors hypothesize that recursive decomposition can overcome issues like concept amalgamation in deeper layers. 

- Can concept importance be estimated more faithfully compared to prior methods? The authors propose using Sobol indices rather than directional derivatives to quantify concept importance.

- Can concept-based attribution maps be generated by backpropagating through the concept factorization? The authors use implicit differentiation to enable concept attribution.

The main hypothesis is that CRAFT's novel ingredients (recursion, Sobol indices, implicit diff) will allow more useful concept-based explanations compared to prior attribution and concept methods. The human experiments and ablation studies aim to evaluate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

- Proposing a new method called CRAFT for automatically extracting interpretable concepts from deep neural networks. The key ideas behind CRAFT are:

1) Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to factorize activations from a network into constituent concepts. 

2) Recursively applying NMF at multiple layers to extract hierarchical concepts and sub-concepts at different levels of abstraction.

3) Estimating concept importance using Sobol sensitivity indices rather than gradient-based methods.

4) Generating concept attribution maps to visualize where concepts appear in images by backpropagating through the NMF using implicit differentiation.

- Introducing 3 new techniques to improve on prior concept-based explanation methods: the recursive extraction of concepts, improved concept importance estimation, and concept attribution maps.

- Conducting human experiments to evaluate the utility and meaningfulness of concepts extracted by CRAFT. Results suggest CRAFT concepts are more useful than attribution maps and competitive with prior concept methods.

- Providing both global and local explanations for model decisions in terms of understandable concepts learned by the network. CRAFT aims to explain both "what" the model sees and "where" in the image.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a human-centered utility benchmark for explainability methods. The concepts from CRAFT significantly improved users' ability to predict model decisions compared to attribution maps.

So in summary, the core contribution appears to be the new CRAFT method for concept-based explanations of neural networks, along with techniques to improve concept extraction and evaluation. The paper shows strong results on human experiments demonstrating the utility of CRAFT concepts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new explainability method called CRAFT that extracts meaningful human-interpretable concepts from deep neural networks and generates both global explanations of the overall concepts used by the model as well as local explanations that highlight where those concepts appear in a given input image.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares and contrasts with other related research:

- The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new method called CRAFT for generating concept-based explanations of neural network decisions. This adds to a growing body of work on concept-based explainability methods, including TCAV and ACE. The key differences are CRAFT's use of non-negative matrix factorization, recursive concept refinement, Sobol indices for concept importance, and concept attribution maps.

- Compared to TCAV, CRAFT aims to automatically discover concepts rather than requiring pre-defined human-labeled concept datasets. The recursive refinement and use of Sobol indices are also novel aspects not present in TCAV. However, TCAV's directional derivatives may provide a more localized importance measure.

- Relative to ACE, CRAFT uses matrix factorization rather than segmentation and clustering. This avoids some limitations around assigning segments to single clusters. The recursive decomposition and Sobol indices are also new. However, ACE has been evaluated more extensively on human subject experiments.

- The human experiments in this paper are similar to recent work like ACE and others aiming to directly test utility for human users. The specific protocol builds on the "meta-predictor" concept introduced by prior work. However, the evaluations remain limited in scale compared to some behavioral testing papers.

- The recursive concept refinement process is unique to CRAFT. Other methods extract concepts at a predefined layer. Allowing concepts to be re-decomposed addresses issues like neural collapse. This recursive breakdown seems intuitive but hasn't been explored much before.

- Using Sobol indices and implicit differentiation through NMF factors is novel, as most prior work uses gradients or model approximations. But it's unclear if these complex additions provide significant benefits compared to simpler attribution methods.

Overall, CRAFT makes several new contributions expanding on prior concept-based explainability work. The paper clearly explains how it differs from and attempts to improve upon similar approaches. More extensive empirical testing would be helpful to better understand its advantages.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing better metrics to evaluate and compare different concept-based explanation methods. Since it is difficult to mathematically measure how understandable the explanations are to humans, the authors suggest creating metrics to allow easier comparison between techniques without needing extensive human experiments.

- Improving the concept visualization and interpretation. The authors recognize that some concepts can be hard to clearly define and label, so they suggest using methods like image captioning or feature visualization to better illustrate the concepts.

- Addressing potential non-uniqueness issues with NMF concept extraction. The authors note that NMF does not have formal guarantees of uniqueness, so they suggest exploring constraints and regularizations to improve stability and obtain consistent solutions. 

- Evaluating performance on limited data regimes. The authors note that enough samples are needed to extract good concepts, so they suggest studying how the quality of explanations is affected when data is scarce.

- Reducing potential confirmation bias. The authors suggest their method could help reduce bias by not using dataset labels, but they note more work is needed to remove it completely.

- Comparing to other concept extraction methods. The authors suggest comparing to other techniques like network dissection or ProtoPNet to better understand the trade-offs of different approaches.

In summary, the main suggestions are around developing better evaluation procedures, improving concept visualization and interpretation, dealing with stability issues in concept extraction, studying data efficiency, mitigating biases, and comparative benchmarking against other methods. Advancing these areas could help transition concept-based explanations into more widespread practical use.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new explainability method called CRAFT (Concept Recursive Activation FacTorization) for interpreting decisions made by deep neural networks. CRAFT automatically extracts human-interpretable concepts from the activation space of neural networks using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). It provides explanations at both the global class-level by identifying important concepts driving decisions, and at the local image-level through concept attribution maps that highlight where those concepts appear. Key novel ingredients include: (1) a recursive process to hierarchically decompose concepts into sub-concepts at proper levels of abstraction, (2) quantifying concept importance with sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices, and (3) generating concept attribution maps by backpropagating through the NMF with implicit differentiation. Experiments demonstrate CRAFT's utility over attribution methods on a human-centered benchmark. Additional analysis validates the benefits of the proposed recursivity to refine concepts, the improved faithfulness of the Sobol importance measure, and the interest of localizing concepts. The method helps provide complementary global and local explanations to elucidate both "what" and "where" models look in making decisions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called CRAFT for generating concept-based explanations of image classifications made by deep neural networks. CRAFT automatically extracts human-interpretable concepts from the activation patterns of a pre-trained neural network model. It does this by applying non-negative matrix factorization to decompose activation maps into sparse concept vectors and corresponding image segment coefficients. The method identifies concepts at multiple levels of abstraction by recursively applying the factorization technique on earlier network layers when needed. CRAFT also introduces a new technique to quantify concept importance using sensitivity analysis and Sobol indices. This allows ranking of concepts based on their influence on the model's predictions. Finally, CRAFT can generate concept attribution maps that visualize where concepts appear in a given image. This is done by leveraging implicit differentiation to backpropagate concept activation values into pixel space. 

Experiments demonstrate that CRAFT concepts are more useful than prior methods for helping people understand and predict model decisions on new examples. Quantitative evaluations also confirm the benefits of the proposed recursive abstraction and concept importance estimation techniques. Overall, CRAFT represents an advance in generating explanations that identify both the high-level concepts and spatial locations influencing a model's predictions. The human-interpretable explanations provided by CRAFT could increase trust and transparency in deep neural network models across applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called CRAFT for generating concept-based explanations of deep neural network models. CRAFT uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract interpretable concepts from the activation maps of a trained model. Specifically, it factorizes the activations for a set of images from a class into two non-negative low-rank matrices - one containing the concept activation vectors (CAVs) that form a concept basis, and another containing the concept coefficients for each image crop in this new basis. Three key ingredients are then introduced: (1) A recursive process to refine concepts by re-applying NMF on the activations from an earlier layer for images containing the concept; (2) Estimating concept importance using Sobol indices rather than gradients to get a more faithful measure; (3) Generating concept attribution maps by implicitly differentiating through the NMF to enable use of standard attribution methods like Grad-CAM in a concept-wise manner. The approach is evaluated through human experiments showing the utility and meaningfulness of the extracted concepts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of developing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that can provide meaningful explanations for decisions made by deep neural networks. 

Specifically, the paper points out limitations with existing attribution methods, which generate heatmaps highlighting important regions of an input image. While attribution methods indicate "where" a model is looking in the image, they do not explain "what" visual features the model is identifying in those regions that drive its decision. 

The key questions the paper aims to address are:

- How can we develop concept-based explanations that identify both the "what" and "where" - the high-level concepts detected by the model and their locations in the input image?

- How can we automatically discover meaningful concepts from a model without requiring manually labeled concept data? 

- How can we quantify the importance of different concepts for a model's predictions?

- How can we generate concept-based attribution maps to visualize where concepts are detected locally in a given image?

The paper introduces a new method called CRAFT to address these challenges and provide more complete concept-based explanations for deep neural networks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Concept-based explainability - The paper focuses on using concepts to explain model decisions, as opposed to traditional attribution methods that use heatmaps. Concepts aim to provide more interpretable explanations.

- Recursive concept decomposition - The proposed CRAFT method recursively decomposes concepts into sub-concepts to find the right level of granularity for human understanding. This addresses the issue of neural collapse where concepts get amalgamated in later layers.

- Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) - NMF is used to factorize activations into interpretable concepts and concept coefficients. It yields more meaningful concepts than other factorization techniques.

- Sobol indices - A technique from sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the importance of concepts to the model's decisions. This provides a more faithful estimate than previous methods. 

- Implicit differentiation - Allows "concept attribution maps" to be generated by backpropagating concept scores into the pixel space. This links global and local explanations.

- Human experiments - Psychophysics experiments are conducted to evaluate the utility, meaningfulness, and coherence of the extracted concepts. This provides evidence for the benefits of the proposed techniques.

- Recursive concept refinement - Showed sub-concepts are more coherent and refined through user experiments.

- Sobol importance estimation - Validated to be more faithful than previous methods using deletion/insertion metrics. 

- Concept attribution maps - Provide local explanations to complement global concepts. Ablation study shows benefit.

In summary, the key focus is on automatic concept-based explanations that are interpretable, faithful, and locally grounded. The proposed CRAFT method aims to address limitations of prior work through recursive decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and implicit differentiation. Rigorous human experiments validate the utility.

This paper introduces CRAFT, a novel approach for explaining neural network predictions using automatically extracted human-interpretable concepts. CRAFT decomposes a network's activations into a sparse concept basis using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

This paper introduces CRAFT, a new approach for generating concept-based explanations of deep neural networks. CRAFT uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to decompose activation patterns from internal layers of a network into interpretable concepts.
