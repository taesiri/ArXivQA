# [RIGHT: Retrieval-augmented Generation for Mainstream Hashtag   Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10466)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mainstream hashtag recommendation for tweets aims to provide users with concise, popular topical tags representing main ideas before publication. 
- Challenges include comprehending new tweets about emerging topics, and accurately identifying mainstream beyond semantically correct hashtags.
- Existing methods have limitations - retrieval-based methods from predefined lists have coverage issues; generation methods may produce non-mainstream hashtags.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose RIGHT - a retrieval-augmented generative mainstream hashtag recommender combining strengths of retrieval and generation.
- Includes a retriever to find relevant hashtags, a selector to enhance mainstream identification, and a generator to produce desired hashtags. 
- Selector uses tweet-hashtag similarity, hashtag frequencies and other signals to select mainstream hashtags to augment input to generator.

Key Contributions:
- Novel adaptation of retrieval-augmented generation framework to mainstream hashtag recommendation. 
- Introduction of selector in this framework to improve mainstream hashtag identification without extra cost.
- State-of-the-art results on THG and WHG datasets outperforming existing methods. 
- Shows robust effectiveness when applied to fine-tuned generators and also large black-box LMs like ChatGPT.
- Detailed analysis provides insights - selector's value, impact of number of augmented hashtags, case studies etc.

In summary, the paper presents a new retrieval-augmented approach called RIGHT that effectively combines strengths of retrieval and generation for improved mainstream hashtag recommendation through an added selector module.
