# Distilling a Neural Network Into a Soft Decision Tree

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we create a model that generalizes well like a deep neural network, but whose decisions are more interpretable and explainable?The authors propose using a trained neural network to help create a soft decision tree model that makes hierarchical decisions based on learned filters. The goal is for this soft decision tree to gain some of the generalization abilities of the neural net through a process called "distillation", while being more interpretable since one can examine the sequence of filters leading to a prediction.In summary, the key research question is how to get the benefits of neural networks (strong generalization) along with the benefits of decision trees (interpretability), by using the neural net to help train a soft decision tree model. The paper explores methods to accomplish this transfer of knowledge from the neural net to the decision tree.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to create a soft decision tree model that is more interpretable than a neural network but can leverage the generalization abilities of a neural network. The key ideas are:- Using a trained neural network to generate soft target distributions for training data, which are then used to train a soft decision tree model. This allows the tree to benefit from the representations learned by the neural net.- Using a specific type of soft decision tree with learned filters at internal nodes and static probability distributions at leaf nodes. This structure allows the model's classifications to be explained by examining the sequence of filters along the path taken for a given input. - Introducing regularizers and design choices like exponential decay penalties to enable effective training of the soft decision tree with stochastic gradient descent.- Showing experimentally that soft decision trees trained this way can reach better accuracy than trees trained directly on data, while being more interpretable than neural networks.So in summary, the main contribution is a method to get the benefits of neural nets' generalization while also gaining interpretability, through training soft decision trees guided by the neural nets' knowledge. The paper demonstrates this approach and analyzes the resulting models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The authors propose a method to train a soft decision tree to mimic a neural network in order to create a more interpretable model that retains some of the neural network's generalization abilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on distilling a neural network into a soft decision tree relates to other research on interpretable machine learning models:- It builds on previous work on model distillation, where a smaller "student" model is trained to mimic a larger "teacher" model. The authors apply this specifically to creating a soft decision tree student model that emulates a neural network teacher.- The goal of creating a more interpretable model aligns with other work on explainable AI. The soft decision tree is proposed as a way to provide explanations for the neural net's predictions. This relates to methods like LIME that also try to explain black box model predictions.- Using soft targets from the teacher model, rather than hard labels, to train the student model follows similar semi-supervised or self-training approaches. Soft targets help transfer knowledge from the teacher to make up for the student's simpler architecture.- The regularization approach to prevent the decision tree from overfitting relates to work on directly regularizing neural networks and other flexible models. The tree-specific regularizers aim to produce a better generalized student model.- Compared to some other interpretable models like small decision trees or linear models, the soft decision tree aims for greater representational power while maintaining interpretability. The hierarchical mixture of experts structure provides more modeling capacity than simpler trees.So in summary, this paper builds on distillation, explainable AI, semi-supervised learning, regularization, and interpretable modeling lines of research to demonstrate an approach for getting the benefits of both neural nets and decision trees. The proposed method aims to advance these different areas.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring the use of unlabelled data or generative models to create larger labeled training sets to help overcome the statistical inefficiency of decision trees. The authors mention that if there is a large amount of unlabelled data, the neural net can help create a larger labeled dataset to better train the decision tree.- Applying convolutional filters instead of fully-connected filters at the internal nodes of the soft decision tree, to take advantage of spatial equivariance in image data. The authors briefly mention the idea of using convolutional filters in the trees.- Incorporating the spatial locations of filter activations into the leaf node distributions, instead of just using static leaf distributions. This could allow the leaves to model spatial relationships between the features detected along the path.- Testing the approach on more complex image datasets like CIFAR-10. The authors tried CIFAR-10 but did not achieve strong results, so improving performance on more complex datasets is noted as an area for future work.- Comparing to other interpretable models besides decision trees, like rule lists, to see if the distillation process could improve their performance. The scope here focuses on decision trees but the ideas could extend to other interpretable models.- Exploring how the amount of regularization affects the interpretability vs accuracy tradeoff. There may be ways to tune the regularizers to optimize this tradeoff.- Developing better quantitative evaluation metrics for interpretability, to compare model explanations. The authors qualitatively show explanations but do not evaluate interpretability directly.So in summary, the key future directions focus on extending the approach to other models and datasets, integrating spatial information, using unlabeled data, and evaluating interpretability more rigorously.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes using trained neural networks to create soft decision trees that are more interpretable but still achieve good generalization performance. The key ideas are:- Decision trees struggle to generalize well compared to neural nets due to only seeing a small fraction of data. The paper proposes using soft targets from a trained neural net when training the decision tree, allowing it to benefit from the neural net's generalization. - Soft binary decision trees are used, where each node splits the data probabilistically based on a learned filter. Leaf nodes contain learned distributions over classes. This structure allows end-to-end training by gradient descent.- The trained soft decision tree acts as a interpretable mimic to the original neural network. While performance is slightly worse, explanations can be provided by examining the series of filters that led to a particular classification.In summary, the paper shows how neural nets can be distilled into soft decision trees that are more interpretable while retaining much of the generalization ability. The tree provides transparency into the reasoning behind predictions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a method to create a soft decision tree that mimics the function learned by a neural network, in order to have a model that generalizes well but is also interpretable. The authors use a specific type of soft decision tree with learned filters at each node to route examples down the tree probabilistically to leaf nodes, which contain learned static distributions over classes. This tree is trained using the predictions of a previously trained neural net as soft targets, a technique called distillation. This allows the tree to generalize better than if it was trained on the hard labels directly.The authors test their method on MNIST, Connect4, and a letter recognition dataset. The soft decision trees achieve better accuracy when trained with the neural net predictions as targets versus the hard labels. They argue these trees are more interpretable than neural nets because the classification decision is explained by the series of learned filters along the path to a leaf node. The filters learn to distinguish between classes rather than model the overall data distribution. This trades off some accuracy for interpretability. Overall, this method transfers some of the generalization abilities of neural nets to models that are more transparent.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method used in this paper is to train a soft decision tree on the predictions of a neural network in order to create a more interpretable model that mimics the function learned by the neural network. Specifically, they first train a neural network on a classification task. Then they use the neural network's predictions on the training data as soft targets to train a soft decision tree model. The soft decision tree has learned filters at each internal node to route examples down the tree, and learned class probability distributions at the leaf nodes. By training the soft decision tree on the neural network's predicted distributions rather than the hard labels, it is able to achieve better generalization performance than training on the labels alone. The tree acts as a highly interpretable mimic of the neural network, providing explanations for its predictions by examining the series of learned filters that lead to a particular leaf node and distribution.
