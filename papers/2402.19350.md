# [Prompting Explicit and Implicit Knowledge for Multi-hop Question   Answering Based on Human Reading Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a gap between pre-trained language models' (PLMs) reasoning abilities and human cognition when solving complex problems. 
- Current research does not effectively link the input passages to the knowledge PLMs acquire during pre-training from a human cognition perspective.
- Psychological studies show an important connection between explicit information in passages and human prior knowledge during reading comprehension.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Prompting Explicit and Implicit knowledge (PEI) framework to address multi-hop QA by modeling input passages as explicit knowledge and PLMs' pre-training-based knowledge as implicit knowledge.
- Use prompts to connect explicit and implicit knowledge, aligning with human reading processes.
- Elicit implicit knowledge from PLMs using input passages (explicit knowledge) through iterative prompting with an encoder-decoder model.
- Incorporate type-specific reasoning via prompts as a form of implicit knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Provides an effective approach for multi-hop QA based on human reading process theories by bridging explicit and implicit knowledge via prompting.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA benchmark. 
- Ablation studies confirm efficacy of model in integrating explicit and implicit knowledge, supporting the hypothesis grounded in human reading theories.
- Demonstrates robust performance across multiple multi-hop QA datasets and evaluation settings.

Overall, the paper develops a novel prompting framework that connects input passages and PLMs' implicit knowledge to enhance reasoning, inspired by human reading cognition theories. Experiments validate the model's efficacy and robustness for multi-hop QA across diverse settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a prompting framework called PEI that bridges explicit knowledge (input passages) and implicit knowledge (PLMs' pre-training knowledge) to enhance reasoning for multi-hop question answering, inspired by human reading comprehension processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The proposed PEI framework provides an effective approach for multi-hop QA based on human reading process, by modeling the input passages or context as explicit knowledge and PLMs mirroring with human prior knowledge as implicit knowledge.

2. The proposed PEI model achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art on HotpotQA, a benchmark dataset for multi-hop QA. It also maintains robust performance on corresponding single-hop sub-questions and other multi-hop datasets. 

3. Ablation studies confirm that implicit knowledge enhances the model's reasoning ability, supporting the hypothesis for the PEI model, which is grounded in the human reading process.

The paper proposes a novel framework called Prompting Explicit and Implicit knowledge (PEI) for multi-hop question answering. It draws inspiration from human reading comprehension theories to connect explicit knowledge (input passages) and implicit knowledge (acquired by PLMs during pre-training) using prompts. Key aspects include eliciting implicit knowledge, incorporating question type information, iterative prompting approach, and evaluations on the HotpotQA benchmark dataset. The method leverages techniques like p-tuning and chain-of-thought prompting as well.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes eliciting implicit knowledge from pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enhance reasoning abilities. What are some ways the implicit knowledge could be represented other than the continuous embeddings used in this work? Could graph structures or logical forms be effective?

2. The knowledge prompter module uses an iterative encoder-decoder framework to elicit implicit knowledge. What are the tradeoffs of using this framework versus alternate approaches like attention mechanisms or memory networks? Could a comparison study shed light?

3. The type prompter identifies question types to enable type-specific reasoning. What are some ways more fine-grained question types could be incorporated? For example, categorizing by the logical relationships needed to reason about the answer.

4. The paper hypothesizes that implicit knowledge reduces reliance on explicit knowledge based on human cognition theories. What experiments could directly test this hypothesis in the model? For example, systematically removing explicit knowledge and evaluating reasoning abilities.

5. Could the framework be extended to sequential or multi-task question answering scenarios to better model long-term reasoning akin to human cognition? What methodological enhancements would be needed?

6. The ablation study shows pre-training on a single-hop dataset provides a small boost. What changes to the pre-training approach could better prime the model for multi-hop reasoning? For example, with multi-task learning objectives.

7. How does the size and diversity of the pre-training corpus impact what implicit knowledge is elicited by the model? What analyses could shed light on these impacts?

8. Does the approach allow reconciling potentially contradictory information from the explicit passages and implicit knowledge? If not, how could the framework be enhanced to handle such cases?

9. Could the elicited implicit knowledge be used to explain or interpret the modelâ€™s predictions? What methods would enable better introspectability into the reasoning process?

10. The evaluation focuses on question answering metrics. What additional evaluations could assess how well the model capturesChains-of-thought and human-like reasoning? For example, rationales, human judgments.
