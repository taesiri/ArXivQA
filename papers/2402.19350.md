# [Prompting Explicit and Implicit Knowledge for Multi-hop Question   Answering Based on Human Reading Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a gap between pre-trained language models' (PLMs) reasoning abilities and human cognition when solving complex problems. 
- Current research does not effectively link the input passages to the knowledge PLMs acquire during pre-training from a human cognition perspective.
- Psychological studies show an important connection between explicit information in passages and human prior knowledge during reading comprehension.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Prompting Explicit and Implicit knowledge (PEI) framework to address multi-hop QA by modeling input passages as explicit knowledge and PLMs' pre-training-based knowledge as implicit knowledge.
- Use prompts to connect explicit and implicit knowledge, aligning with human reading processes.
- Elicit implicit knowledge from PLMs using input passages (explicit knowledge) through iterative prompting with an encoder-decoder model.
- Incorporate type-specific reasoning via prompts as a form of implicit knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Provides an effective approach for multi-hop QA based on human reading process theories by bridging explicit and implicit knowledge via prompting.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA benchmark. 
- Ablation studies confirm efficacy of model in integrating explicit and implicit knowledge, supporting the hypothesis grounded in human reading theories.
- Demonstrates robust performance across multiple multi-hop QA datasets and evaluation settings.

Overall, the paper develops a novel prompting framework that connects input passages and PLMs' implicit knowledge to enhance reasoning, inspired by human reading cognition theories. Experiments validate the model's efficacy and robustness for multi-hop QA across diverse settings.
