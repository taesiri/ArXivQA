## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "MapTracker: Tracking with Strided Memory Fusion for Consistent Vector HD Mapping":

Problem:
- Existing vector HD mapping methods focus on per-frame reconstruction via detection-style transformers, without enforcing temporal consistency. They detect road elements anew in each frame, leading to inconsistent outputs over time.
- Using a standard recurrent memory to accumulate history information faces challenges, especially in cluttered environments where vehicles frequently occlude the road.

Proposed Solution - MapTracker:
- Formulates mapping as a tracking task, borrowing the query propagation paradigm from tracking literature to explicitly associate tracked road elements across frames.

- Uses a history of memory latents from past frames as the memory mechanism, consisting of:
  - Raster latents in BEV space
  - Vector latents over tracked road elements

- Employs memory buffers to store latents from past 20 frames, making the memory robust but redundant.

- Fuses a subset of memories selected with distance strides for efficiency and coverage.

- Decodes each vector latent to reconstruct geometry of a road element.

Main Contributions:
- Novel vector HD mapping algorithm that leverages history of raster and vector latents to achieve temporal consistency by formulating mapping as tracking.

- Improves benchmark datasets by:
  - Enhancing processing code to produce consistent ground truth with temporal alignments 
  - Proposing consistency-aware mAP metric

- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art with over 8% and 19% gains on conventional and new consistency-aware metrics.

- Qualitative results demonstrate MapTracker produces high-quality, temporally consistent vector HD maps. A simple online merging of per-frame outputs creates clean global vector HD maps.
