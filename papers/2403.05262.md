# [Debiasing Large Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit notable biases towards the language priors from their underlying language models rather than focusing on the given visual inputs. This causes issues like hallucination where models generate confident outputs without relying on images.

- There is a lack of efficient, training-free methods to address the biases and hallucination issues in LVLMs originating from inherent language model biases. Fine-tuning models on specialized datasets is resource-intensive.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce two training-free debiasing strategies - "Post-hoc debiasing" of predictions and "Debias sampling" of token probabilities during decoding.

- Post-hoc debiasing uses output calibration to adjust prediction probabilities based on a meaningless visual input. Debias sampling contrasts token probabilities from meaningful vs meaningless inputs.

- Systematically search optimal decoding configurations like temperature and top-k sampling to enhance model capabilities beyond default settings.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate the efficacy of two proposed debiasing methods in mitigating biases and hallucination while preserving accuracy.

- Show that exploring optimal decoding settings significantly boosts performance of existing LVLMs, indicating potential underestimation of capabilities. 

- Raise concerns regarding fairness of current evaluations relying solely on default decoding configurations, emphasizing the need for multi-configuration assessment.

- Provide insights into limitations of attention mechanisms and training strategies in LVLMs contributing to observed biases.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in understanding and mitigating biases in LVLMs via efficient, training-free techniques while enhancing evaluation rigor through multi-configuration testing.
