# [Questions Are All You Need to Train a Dense Passage Retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10658)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can an accurate and robust passage retriever be trained using only questions, without requiring labeled question-passage pairs or hard negatives?The key hypothesis is that a passage retriever can be trained in an unsupervised manner by using a pre-trained language model to provide "soft labels" on how relevant retrieved passages are for reconstructing the original question.In particular, the paper proposes and evaluates a new approach called ART (Autoencoding Retriever Training) which trains the passage retriever based on maximizing question reconstruction likelihood from the retrieved passages. This allows for unsupervised training of the retriever without needing annotated training data.The main goal is to show that the proposed ART method can match or exceed the performance of supervised methods like DPR on passage retrieval benchmarks, despite using only questions during training. The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this unsupervised autoencoding approach for training retrievers.
