# [Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition in Construction Supply Chain   Risk Management in Australia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13755)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the use of transformer-based natural language processing models, specifically BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, for named entity recognition (NER) in the domain of construction supply chain risk management in Australia. The goal is to automatically extract important risk-related entities from news articles to gain insights into vulnerabilities in construction supply chains. A dataset of news articles is annotated with entity labels across six risk taxonomies specific to Australian construction. Multiple experiments compare the NER performance of the transformer models on this dataset in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores. Overall, RoBERTa demonstrates the best performance with an average F1 score of 0.858. Analyses also examine the relationship between entity frequency and model accuracy, finding that higher frequency entities generally yield better scores. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning using grid search indicates optimal combinations of learning rate, batch size, epsilon value and Adam vs. AdamW optimizer for each model. The highest scoring model, configuration and trends provide guidance on model selection and tuning strategies for future NER systems aimed at improving risk management and resilience in construction supply chains via automated and timely analysis of textual data sources.
