# [Questioning Biases in Case Judgment Summaries: Legal Datasets or Large   Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00554)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates potential biases present in case judgment summaries produced by legal datasets and large language models (LLMs). The research examines biases related to gender, race, crime against women, country names, and religious terms in Indian and United Kingdom legal case summaries. The results show slight biases favoring female terms in both the Indian and UK summaries. Additionally, some legal domain models exhibit strong biases towards mentioning certain countries like the United States more frequently. Analyzing UK case summaries specifically, there are noticeable biases related to certain crimes against women. However, no significant evidence of racial or religious biases is found in either the Indian or UK summaries. While advanced models promise efficiency in summarizing legal documents, the reasoning behind embedded biases needs further analysis to ensure fairness and neutrality. Overall, the research contributes to better understanding AI's role in law by questioning the accuracy and implications of new technologies like datasets and LLMs in critical legal decision-making contexts.
