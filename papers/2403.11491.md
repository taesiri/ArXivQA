# [Uncertainty-Calibrated Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper tackles three key limitations of existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods: 1) Efficiency hurdle - prior TTA methods require multiple backwards passes for each test sample, resulting in high latency which is impractical for many applications; 2) Catastrophic forgetting - adapting on out-of-distribution (OOD) test data leads to performance degradation on in-distribution (ID) test data; 3) Overconfidence - minimizing prediction entropy encourages overconfident predictions even for uncertain test samples.

Proposed Solution: 
Two methods are proposed - Efficient Anti-forgetting Test-time Adaptation (EATA) and EATA with Calibration (EATA-C). 

EATA has two main components:
1) Sample-efficient entropy minimization - An active sample selection criterion is designed to identify reliable and non-redundant test samples for adaptation, improving efficiency by reducing required backwards passes. 
2) Anti-forgetting regularization - A label-dependent Fisher regularizer estimated from test samples constrains important model weights from changing drastically during adaptation, alleviating forgetting on ID test data.

EATA-C further addresses the overconfidence issue by differentiating between reducible model uncertainty and inherent data uncertainty:
1) Model uncertainty is estimated by divergence between predictions from the full network and sub-networks, which is minimized for consistent predictions.  
2) Data uncertainty is measured via prediction disagreements. A min-max entropy regularizer selectively lowers/increases confidence based on this to recalibrate prediction confidence.

Main Contributions:
1) EATA enhances adaptation efficiency via active sample selection and prevents catastrophic forgetting with anti-forgetting regularization estimated from test samples.
2) EATA-C further achieves calibrated predictions by separately modeling model uncertainty for uncertainty reduction and leveraging data uncertainty for selective confidence recalibration.
3) Extensive experiments verify EATA's superior efficiency and anti-forgetting ability. EATA-C further significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods in accuracy, efficiency and uncertainty calibration.
