# [Asymptotic expansions for the maximum likelihood estimation errors of   the rotating parameter of the gravitational wave from core-collapse   supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.1267)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: What is the expected accuracy in estimating the rotation parameter β for gravitational waves generated during the core bounce phase of core-collapse supernovae? 

The rotation parameter β describes the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy in the collapsing stellar core. It is an important parameter for characterizing the degree of differential rotation in the progenitor star. The authors want to quantify the uncertainty in estimating β from the gravitational wave signal detected from a galactic or nearby extragalactic core-collapse supernova.

To address this question, the authors use asymptotic expansions of the maximum likelihood estimator errors to compute the bias and covariance of β estimates. They develop an analytical model for the core bounce gravitational waveform that depends on β. By computing the first and second order expansions, they can assess how reliably β can be estimated from the detected signals. The analysis aims to determine if the presence of rotation could be resolved from the gravitational wave detection and how accurately β could be quantified for different progenitor rotation rates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- It develops an analytical model to fit the gravitational wave signals from rapidly rotating core-collapse supernovae during the core bounce phase. The model uses Gaussian functions to match the characteristic three peak structure seen in numerical simulations. 

- It applies asymptotic expansions for maximum likelihood estimation errors to quantify the accuracy in estimating the rotation parameter β from the gravitational wave signal. This allows determining the expected measurement uncertainty on β as a function of signal-to-noise ratio.

- It calculates the estimation errors on β for signals from distances between 5-100 kpc using projected noise curves for LIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. The key result is that for most scenarios, the error Δβ/β can be 10% or better, allowing detection of rotation.

- The SNR is also estimated as a function of β. This indicates the threshold in β needed for detection over noise. The SNR increases for higher β and smaller distances, as expected.

In summary, this analytical model and parameter estimation analysis aims to quantify the potential for future gravitational wave detectors to accurately estimate the rotation rate of core-collapse supernova progenitors using the bounce signal. The ability to measure rotation would provide valuable insights into the progenitor structure.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper develops an analytical model of the gravitational wave signal from a rotating core-collapse supernova and uses maximum likelihood estimation error analysis to show the rotation parameter beta can be estimated from the core bounce signal with good accuracy for nearby events.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae:

- The use of asymptotic expansions for maximum likelihood estimation errors is a novel approach in this field. Most other papers have focused on matched filtering or Bayesian parameter estimation to predict measurement accuracies. Applying estimation theory tools like the Cramer-Rao lower bound provides a more rigorous framework for quantifying fundamental limits on parameter estimation.

- The analytical waveform model developed here for the core bounce signal is fairly simple compared to some other efforts. Some papers have used more detailed simulations to extract analytical fits or principal components for the full supernova waveform. However, focusing just on the deterministic core bounce may be reasonable for an initial rotation study.

- Most parameter estimation work has looked at overall measures like whether rotation can be detected at all for a given source. Estimating the rotation parameter β and predicting the estimation variance as a function of β provides more nuanced information about the dependency on rotation rate.

- Compared to compact binary signals, rapid estimation of parameters for transients like supernovae using short waveform segments is less developed. This analysis is a good step toward quantifying errors in a realistic scenario where signals may be short and noisy.

- The distances considered reach out to extragalactic ranges, whereas some other work has focused only on galactic supernova prospects. Exploring different detector noise curves is also useful for thinking about future detectors.

Overall, this paper advances the study of rotation measurement in an important astrophysical source by applying estimation theory in a detailed and rigorous way. Connecting the estimated errors back to physical bounds on progenitor property estimation is a valuable contribution. The analytical modeling also provides a framework that could be built up with more detailed simulations in the future.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop more realistic analytical models of the gravitational wave signal from core-collapse supernovae, including effects like non-axisymmetric instabilities. The analytical model in this paper captures the overall amplitude dependence on rotation but does not account for detailed waveform morphology. 

- Combine gravitational wave parameter estimation of core bounce with other supernova gravitational wave signatures and neutrino/electromagnetic observations for more robust progenitor characterization. For example, gravitational wave emission from post-bounce convection and g-modes also contains information about the progenitor.

- Apply the asymptotic expansion methodology to other core-collapse supernova gravitational wave features beyond the bounce signal. This can quantify expected parameter estimation accuracy for progenitor properties from the full supernova gravitational waveform. 

- Extend the analysis to waveforms from 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, which capture non-axisymmetric dynamics absent in 2D simulations. This can reveal if rotation still dominates the gravitational wave emission in the more chaotic 3D case.

- Evaluate how well matched filtering can estimate parameters for a more realistic noise model including glitches. The analysis here assumes stationary, Gaussian noise.

- Assess potential biases in parameter estimation due to physical effects not included in the analytical model, like strong magnetic fields.

- Apply the tools developed here to simulated data and quantify the agreement with the predicted parameter uncertainty ranges. This can validate the efficacy of the maximum likelihood error estimation techniques.

In summary, the authors propose several interesting directions to further develop gravitational wave-based progenitor characterization for core-collapse supernovae using parameter estimation tools like the ones explored in this work. Combining information from different messengers and simulation inputs remains an important goal.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper develops asymptotic expansions for the errors of a maximum likelihood estimator of the rotation parameter β for the gravitational waves generated during the core bounce phase of rapidly rotating core collapse supernovae. The authors model the core bounce signal analytically using three Gaussian pulses with amplitudes and time shifts that depend on β. They then compute the first and second order expansions of the bias and covariance of the maximum likelihood estimator for β. The results indicate that for larger values of β (faster rotation), the relative error in estimating β can be quite small, under 10% for galactic sources. This suggests it may be possible to accurately determine the presence and amount of rotation in the supernova progenitor using these gravitational wave signals. The signal-to-noise ratio also increases with increasing β, further improving detectability and estimation for more rapidly rotating progenitors. Overall, this technique shows promise for extracting key rotational physics from the gravitational waves emitted during stellar core collapse events.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper obtains error estimates for the maximum likelihood estimation of the rotation parameter β from the gravitational wave signal emitted during the core bounce phase of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The waveforms are modeled analytically based on numerical simulations, with the amplitudes and timing of the three characteristic peaks during core bounce parameterized as functions of β. Using asymptotic expansions for the covariance of maximum likelihood estimators, the errors in β are estimated for signals from sources at varying distances observed with LIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. 

The key findings are that the error Δβ/β decreases for larger values of β and increases for more distant sources, with estimation accuracies of 10% or better for Galactic CCSNe. The errors are dominated by the first order approximation, indicating the maximum likelihood approach is near-optimal. The signal-to-noise ratio also increases with β. Overall, the results suggest current and planned detectors can accurately estimate the rotation parameter β, providing a probe of the angular momentum distribution in CCSNe progenitors from the resulting gravitational waves. The method demonstrates the potential for detailed characterization of CCSNe physics once signals are detected.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is applying asymptotic expansions for the maximum likelihood estimation errors to estimate the accuracy in determining the rotation parameter beta for gravitational waves generated during the core bounce phase of core-collapse supernovae. 

Specifically, the authors use analytical models to represent the gravitational waveform during core bounce, with the amplitude of characteristic peaks dependent on beta. They then calculate the Fisher information matrix and use its inverse (the CRLB) to get the first order error estimate on beta. They also calculate the second order term in the error expansion. Since the second order term is much smaller than the first order, this indicates the CRLB gives a good estimate of the error, meaning the maximum likelihood estimator (matched filter) is optimal for estimating beta. They find the relative error decreases for larger beta values, meaning rotation can be determined accurately for rapidly rotating progenitors. The SNR also increases with beta, further supporting accurate beta estimation for rapid rotation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing how accurately we can estimate the rotation rate of the inner core of a core-collapse supernova progenitor based on the gravitational wave signal detected during the core bounce phase. Specifically, it focuses on quantifying the error in estimating the rotation parameter beta, which describes the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy. 

The key questions and goals of the paper appear to be:

- Developing an analytical model to represent the core bounce gravitational waveform that depends on beta.

- Applying asymptotic expansions for maximum likelihood estimation errors to compute the bias and variance in estimating beta from the waveform model.

- Determining if the error in beta is small enough to reliably detect rotation for galactic and nearby extragalactic supernova progenitors. 

- Assessing if the gravitational wave signal alone can provide sufficient accuracy, or if neutrino signals or other messengers would be needed to resolve degeneracies.

So in summary, this paper aims to quantify the prospects for estimating the rotation rate of core-collapse supernovae from the gravitational wave signature of the core bounce, which could provide valuable insights into the progenitor structure. The focus is on analyzing the theoretical estimation errors for beta.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper focuses on estimating the error in the rotation parameter β of the gravitational wave signal generated during the core bounce phase of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The authors develop an analytical model fitting the characteristic three-peaked waveform from numerical simulations, where the peak amplitudes depend on β. Using asymptotic expansions of the covariance for maximum likelihood estimators, they compute the bias and variance in estimating β.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 This paper develops an analytical model to estimate the error in measuring the rotation parameter β from the gravitational wave signal emitted during the core bounce phase of a core-collapse supernova. The model is inspired by numerical simulations showing the amplitude of the characteristic three peaks in the core bounce gravitational waveform depends primarily on β. Using asymptotic expansions of the maximum likelihood estimator errors, the authors calculate the bias and covariance up to second order for estimating β. They find the second order terms are negligible, indicating the first order approximation is sufficient. For rapidly rotating progenitors with β > 0.08, the relative error ∆β/β can be 10% or better for sources within the Milky Way. The signal-to-noise ratio and fitting factor also improve for larger β. Overall, the results suggest current and future detectors should accurately measure β for galactic supernovae, providing a probe of progenitor rotation.
