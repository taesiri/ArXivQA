# [Asymptotic expansions for the maximum likelihood estimation errors of   the rotating parameter of the gravitational wave from core-collapse   supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.1267)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: What is the expected accuracy in estimating the rotation parameter β for gravitational waves generated during the core bounce phase of core-collapse supernovae? The rotation parameter β describes the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy in the collapsing stellar core. It is an important parameter for characterizing the degree of differential rotation in the progenitor star. The authors want to quantify the uncertainty in estimating β from the gravitational wave signal detected from a galactic or nearby extragalactic core-collapse supernova.To address this question, the authors use asymptotic expansions of the maximum likelihood estimator errors to compute the bias and covariance of β estimates. They develop an analytical model for the core bounce gravitational waveform that depends on β. By computing the first and second order expansions, they can assess how reliably β can be estimated from the detected signals. The analysis aims to determine if the presence of rotation could be resolved from the gravitational wave detection and how accurately β could be quantified for different progenitor rotation rates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It develops an analytical model to fit the gravitational wave signals from rapidly rotating core-collapse supernovae during the core bounce phase. The model uses Gaussian functions to match the characteristic three peak structure seen in numerical simulations. - It applies asymptotic expansions for maximum likelihood estimation errors to quantify the accuracy in estimating the rotation parameter β from the gravitational wave signal. This allows determining the expected measurement uncertainty on β as a function of signal-to-noise ratio.- It calculates the estimation errors on β for signals from distances between 5-100 kpc using projected noise curves for LIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. The key result is that for most scenarios, the error Δβ/β can be 10% or better, allowing detection of rotation.- The SNR is also estimated as a function of β. This indicates the threshold in β needed for detection over noise. The SNR increases for higher β and smaller distances, as expected.In summary, this analytical model and parameter estimation analysis aims to quantify the potential for future gravitational wave detectors to accurately estimate the rotation rate of core-collapse supernova progenitors using the bounce signal. The ability to measure rotation would provide valuable insights into the progenitor structure.
