## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method for estimating the 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) camera pose from a single image by aligning two predicted 3D map representations of the scene. The key ideas are: 1) Predicting two corresponding maps - one with 3D coordinates in the global frame and one with 3D coordinates in the camera frame estimated from predicted depth, 2) Utilizing a network of relative pose constraints between both consecutive and distant cameras in space and time as extra training signals, 3) Estimating weighting factors to guide alignment of the two predicted maps to get the pose. A single-step weighted rigid alignment is used for pose estimation. The method shows strong performance in learning to localize from very sparse 3D ground truth data - less than 1%. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on standard indoor and outdoor pose estimation benchmarks, outperforming other direct pose regression techniques. The main limitations are slightly lower performance compared to indirect methods utilizing robust outlier filtering. Overall, this paper introduces an effective technique to inject geometric constraints for improving deep network pose estimation performance.
