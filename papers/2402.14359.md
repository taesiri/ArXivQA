# [Rethinking Scientific Summarization Evaluation: Grounding Explainable   Metrics on Facet-aware Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Existing automatic evaluation metrics for scientific paper summarization lack explainability and struggle to adequately grasp key scientific concepts or content. Methods like ROUGE and BERTScore rely on word/ngram overlaps, while QA and verification-based techniques have evaluation biases or sample biases. There is also no standard evaluation benchmark tailored for scientific summarization.

Proposed Solution: The authors introduce a Facet-aware Metric (FM) that leverages large language models for more advanced semantic matching. It evaluates summaries by comparing them to the reference paper across four facets - background, method, results and conclusion. A new Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) is also introduced with facet-level human annotations to serve as an evaluation benchmark.  

Key Contributions:
- Facet-aware metric that provides transparent and multi-perspective evaluation of scientific summaries through facet-based decomposition. Closely aligns with human judgment.
- First benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating scientific summarization systems across diverse fields like biomedicine and physics.
- Analysis showing smaller tuned models can compete with large LLMs for scientific summarization, while LLMs have limitations in in-context learning of scientific knowledge.  
- Quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrates the effectiveness of facet-based decomposition for both evaluating and reading/understanding scientific abstracts.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in rethinking evaluation for scientific summarization through a novel decomposed paradigm tailored for this domain. Both the metric and benchmark dataset advance research towards producing and accurately assessing automated summaries of scholarly literature.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It analyzes limitations of existing evaluation metrics for scientific text summarization, showing they lack explainability and struggle to capture key scientific concepts or content. 

2. It introduces a new Facet-aware Metric (FM) that leverages large language models for semantic matching assessments across different facets (background, method, results, conclusion). This provides a more thorough, interpretable evaluation.

3. It presents the first benchmark dataset for evaluating scientific summarization metrics, spanning two domains (arXiv and PubMed papers). This contains 500 abstracts generated by different systems.

4. Analysis using this benchmark shows the new FM metric aligns much closer with human judgments than existing metrics. It also reveals interesting findings about summarization systems, like smaller finetuned models rivalling LLMs performance.

5. The paper demonstrates the value of decomposing evaluation into clearer facets/subtasks. This simplifies the process for language models and humans, enabling better understanding of summary quality.

In summary, the key contributions are: a new facet-aware evaluation paradigm/metric for scientific summarization, an accompanying benchmark dataset, and analysis showing the benefits of this decomposed evaluation approach.
