# [Localized Symbolic Knowledge Distillation for Visual Commonsense Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04837)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called "Localized Symbolic Knowledge Distillation (LSKD)" to train visual reasoning models that can understand scenes at both the global and local level, by allowing users to specify objects/regions in an image through "pointing". LSKD involves using an LLM (ChatGPT) to generate commonsense inference statements conditioned on literal descriptions of images from VL models, including global image captions as well as local region descriptors. To address inaccuracies from the VL models, they train a critic model on human annotations to filter low-quality statements. The resulting 1M statement "Localized Commonsense Knowledge Corpus" is used to finetune VL models like BLIP-2 to support localized reasoning and reference-grounded tasks. Experiments show state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 3 localized visual reasoning benchmarks over baselines, and human evaluation finds the student model can better answer localized visual questions than the teacher LLM. Key advantages are the method's scalability without human involvement, its applicability to improve existing VL models without architecture changes, and enabling more precise reasoning grounded to image regions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Localized Symbolic Knowledge Distillation (LSKD), a method to train visual commonsense models that can accept localized image regions as input by prompting a language model to generate commonsense inferences conditioned on both global and local image descriptions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Localized Symbolic Knowledge Distillation (LSKD) to train visual commonsense models that can accept localized visual references (specific regions in an image) as input. The key ideas are:

1) Automatically generating a large-scale localized commonsense knowledge corpus by prompting a language model (ChatGPT) with both global and local literal descriptions of images. The local descriptions allow associating commonsense with specific regions in the image.

2) Using a separately trained critic model to filter the generated corpus and keep only high-quality, visually coherent examples. This addresses errors due to the language model hallucinating or misunderstanding the literal descriptions. 

3) Showing that fine-tuning vision-language models like BLIP-2 on this filtered, localized commonsense corpus enables them to support a "pointing"-style interface for localized reasoning without any architectural changes.

4) Demonstrating state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 3 localized visual reasoning benchmarks and improved performance on non-localized benchmarks as well. Human evaluations also suggest the student model trained this way can outperform the teacher language model for answering localized visual questions.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel knowledge distillation framework to enhance visual commonsense models to incorporate localized references as inputs for more precise reasoning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the localized symbolic knowledge distillation (LSKD) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a separately trained critic model to select high-quality examples from the localized commonsense corpus generated by the language model. What are some ways this critic model could be improved or adapted to better filter the corpus? For example, using more supervised data, incorporating visual features directly, or employing an adversarial training approach.

2. The paper evaluates LSKD in a zero-shot setup on downstream tasks. What potential benefits or downsides might there be to incorporating some amount of supervised finetuning on the target tasks after pretraining with the synthesized corpus?

3. The paper finds that more critical filtering by the critic model leads to better performance on the downstream tasks. Is there a risk that overly aggressive filtering could reduce diversity and hurt generalization ability? How could the threshold be optimized?

4. The paper explores both generative and discriminative student models. In what ways might the choice of student model architecture interact with the effectiveness of distillation from the teacher language model? Are certain model types better suited?

5. Could the proposed LSKD framework be extended to other modalities beyond vision, such as audio or video? What changes would need to be made to the image/region verbalizers and prompting process?

6. The human evaluations find that student models can outperform the teacher in certain metrics like informativeness. Why might this be the case? Does it reveal limitations in the teacher's reasoning capabilities?

7. What other large language models beyond ChatGPT could serve as effective teacher models for LSKD? How might model scale, architecture, or pretraining objective impact the generated localized knowledge?  

8. The paper focuses on physical entities and relations for localization. How could the framework incorporate more abstract concepts like attributes, emotions, intents? Would different prompting strategies be required?

9. Error analysis shows the model struggles with spatial reasoning and fine-grained facial expressions. Are there any possible ways to improve performance on these fronts? For example, through multi-task training or intermediate pretraining targets?

10. The paper uses bounding boxes to localize regions. Could this be extended to support more complex and precise spatial references like segmented masks or 3D coordinates? How might that impact generation and training?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-language (VL) models that operate on full images lack the capability for users to specify and "point to" regions of interest within the image as part of the input query. This limits precise within-image reasoning.
- Referring expression datasets require describing regions explicitly, which is cumbersome and challenging even for humans. 

Proposed Solution - Localized Symbolic Knowledge Distillation (LSKD):
- Sample localized commonsense inferences from a large language model (LLM) conditioned on both global and local literal image descriptions generated automatically from VL models.  
- Train a critic model on human annotations to identify high-quality inferences and filter the corpus.
- Finetune VL models on the filtered corpus to support localized visual reasoning without architectural modifications.

Main Contributions:
1. A scalable framework to generate reliable, localized visual commonsense statements 
2. The Localized Commonsense Knowledge Corpus with 1M localized statements over 250K images that can expand region reasoning capacity of VL models
3. State-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 3 localized visual reasoning benchmarks
4. Human evaluation showing the student model outperforms the teacher LLM in answering localized visual questions

The key insight is that by conditioning the language model on both global and local grounded image descriptors, high-quality localized scene understanding can be distilled - no manual annotation needed. Finetuning on this large-scale synthetic corpus then enables VL models to incorporate region-based inputs without changes to model architecture. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate enhanced localization reasoning capacity compared to prior work.
