# [SeasFire as a Multivariate Earth System Datacube for Wildfire Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07199)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces the SeasFire datacube, a novel spatiotemporal dataset tailored for global seasonal wildfire modeling through Earth observation. Comprised of 59 variables spanning climate, vegetation, ocean indices, and anthropogenic factors over 21 years (2001-2021) at 8-day temporal and 0.25 degree spatial resolution, SeasFire facilitates studying drivers of wildfire occurrence. Its global coverage enables location-agnostic predictive modeling to anticipate wildfire impacts. The authors demonstrate SeasFire's utility through data visualization revealing seasonal patterns, causal analysis confirming climate-wildfire connections, and deep learning forecasting burned area spatial distributions months in advance. Overall, by consolidating diverse wildfire-related variables into an analysis-ready datacube, the work empowers earth systems scientists and machine learning researchers to gain insights into wildfire dynamics across teleconnected processes. The open-access availability of SeasFire is poised to spur innovative data-driven methods for sub-seasonal wildfire modeling and mitigation worldwide.
