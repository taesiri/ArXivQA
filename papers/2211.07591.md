# [Imagination is All You Need! Curved Contrastive Learning for Abstract   Sequence Modeling Utilized on Long Short-Term Dialogue Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07591)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses that this paper explores are:1) Do chit-chat conversations have planning capability? (RQ1) The paper hypothesizes that even chit-chat conversations can be considered goal-oriented, based on literature from psychology showing conversation is a goal-directed process. The authors test this by evaluating the planning capability of chit-chat dialogues over multiple turns using their proposed evaluation techniques.2) What characteristics make dialogue planning possible? (RQ2)The paper hypothesizes there may be significant differences in the plannability of different intents (e.g. requests vs informing). The authors analyze the planning capability on dialogues with different intents to investigate what factors influence plannability.The main technical contribution is proposing Curved Contrastive Learning (CCL) to learn utterance embeddings that capture conversational position and directional awareness. CCL is evaluated on three dialogue planning tasks: short-term planning, next utterance selection, and long-term planning. A key hypothesis seems to be that the curved embeddings can enable more effective planning compared to prior approaches.In summary, the two main research questions focus on analyzing the planning capability and characteristics of chit-chat dialogues. The curved contrastive learning method is proposed as a technical approach to improve planning, and is evaluated on planning tasks to test its effectiveness.
