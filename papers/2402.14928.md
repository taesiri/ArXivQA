# [Learning Inverse Kinodynamics for Autonomous Vehicle Drifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14928)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Motion planning for drifting autonomous vehicles is challenging as the executed trajectory often deviates from the planned trajectory due to factors like wheel slippage. 
- The authors want to learn an inverse kinodynamic (IKD) model to correct the executed trajectory to more closely match the planned trajectory.

Proposed Solution:
- Collect inertial measurement data from the vehicle while teleoperating drifting maneuvers. 
- Train a neural network to learn the IKD model which maps from linear velocity, angular velocity to a corrected angular velocity. 
- At test time, feed the planned linear velocity and angular velocity to predict a corrected angular velocity using the IKD model. Use this corrected value to execute more accurate trajectories.

Data Collection and Training:
- Collected multiple datasets: basic turning at different speeds, loose drifting trajectories, tight drifting trajectories.
- Aligned and merged data into a final dataset for training.
- Trained a small 3-layer neural network with MSE loss to learn the IKD model.

Experiments:
- Validated model by testing autonomous circular trajectories - IKD model corrected curvature closer to commanded values.
- Conducted autonomous drifting tests - model successfully tightened loose drifts but struggled with very tight drifts.

Contributions:
- Demonstrated collecting data and learning an IKD model for trajectory correction.
- Showed model can successfully correct trajectories for basic turns and loose drifts. 
- Identified limitations - more data needed for tight drifts, simpler model formulation.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being solved, the data-driven approach to learning the IKD model, the experiments conducted, results, and limitations. It highlights the core contributions around learning to correct trajectories using an IKD model in the context of autonomous drifting.
