# [MatPlotAgent: Method and Evaluation for LLM-Based Agentic Scientific   Data Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Scientific data visualization plays a crucial role in research by enabling researchers to directly display complex information and identify implicit patterns. However, transforming raw data into informative visualizations remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. The use of large language models (LLMs) for automated scientific data visualization is still rather unexplored.

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces MatPlotAgent, an efficient model-agnostic LLM agent framework to automate scientific data visualization. It consists of three core modules:

1. Query understanding module that interprets and refines user queries into detailed step-by-step instructions. 

2. Code generation module with iterative debugging capabilities that generates code to preprocess data and create plots.

3. Visual feedback module powered by multi-modal LLMs that provides suggestions to improve the figure based on the current draft.

The framework is compatible with both commercial LLMs like GPT-4 and open-source LLMs like Magicoder.

To enable quantitative evaluation, the paper also proposes MatPlotBench, a benchmark with 100 human-verified test cases. Each case contains a query, raw data, and ground truth figure. An automatic scoring method based on GPT-4V is introduced and shown to strongly correlate with human judgement.

Main Contributions:

1. Introduction of MatPlotAgent, an LLM agent framework to enhance automated scientific data visualization using both code LLMs and multi-modal LLMs.

2. Creation of MatPlotBench, a high-quality benchmark for quantitative evaluation of methods in this area, with an reliable automatic scoring mechanism.

The experimental results demonstrate that MatPlotAgent can effectively improve the visualization capabilities of various LLMs. The benchmark and scoring mechanism also provide a standardized testbed to advance research in this novel and impactful direction.
