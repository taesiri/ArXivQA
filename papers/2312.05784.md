# [Graph-based Prediction and Planning Policy Network (GP3Net) for scalable   self-driving in dynamic environments using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05784)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing autonomous vehicle (AV) motion planning methods like rule-based and imitation learning rely on expert demonstrations and have limited ability to handle distribution shifts and recover from near-failure scenarios in complex, dynamic driving environments. They fail to generalize well across varying traffic conditions and weather. 

Proposed Solution - GP3Net:
The paper proposes a deep Graph-based Prediction and Planning Policy Network (GP3Net) to enable scalable and safe self-driving in non-stationary environments. The key components are:

1. Spatio-temporal graph model to encode interactions between traffic participants (vehicles, pedestrians etc.) and predict their future trajectories along with uncertainties using a Trajectron architecture. 

2. Future mask generation module to create bird's eye view occupancy maps embedding information about predicted positions of participants and evolution of environment.

3. AV neural architecture comprising a state encoder and policy network outputting acceleration and steering values. The architecture is trained end-to-end using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize for safe maneuvering.  

4. Reward structure to encourage completing routes while penalizing infractions.

Main Contributions:

- Novel incorporation of learned spatio-temporal graph-based future trajectory predictions into RL-based motion planning model to enhance safety.

- State representation combining past and predicted future bird's eye view scene representations for effective decision making.

- Demonstrated improved performance over prior arts across multiple towns and weather conditions in CARLA driving simulator, especially in complex dynamic environments. 

- Qualitative analysis highlighted the advantage of modeling interactions and predicting evolution of environments for safe planning.

In summary, the paper presents a new predictive planning approach GP3Net that leverages graph-based modeling of scene dynamics to enable reliable and scalable self-driving in complex environments.
