# [CityGen: Infinite and Controllable 3D City Layout Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "CityGen: Infinite and Controllable 3D City Layout Generation":

Problem:
- Generating realistic and customizable 3D layouts of entire city scenes is challenging due to the complexity and scale of urban environments. 
- Prior works using VAEs, GANs or diffusion models have limitations in diversity, controllability, and global structural coherence of generated city layouts.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CityGen, an end-to-end framework to generate infinite, coherent and controllable 3D city layouts.

- It represents the 3D layout using just a semantic field and height field in bird's eye view for efficiency.

- For semantic field generation, it first uses diffusion models to create a low-res local semantic block, then expands it to a global layout using an outpainting pipeline. 

- It refines the global semantic field to high-res using a novel multi-scale refinement network that combines global semantics with local details.

- For height field generation, it assigns height values to points in each semantic class separately based on real-world elevation patterns. 

- The framework allows user control over layout generation through sketch-based interactions.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes an efficient BEV representation for 3D city layouts.

- Develops a pipeline to generate infinite, high-quality semantic fields via outpainting and multi-scale refinement.

- Presents separate height modeling for each semantic class to enable precise and customizable 3D layout construction.  

- Enables user-control over layout generation through sketch-based guidance.

- Achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results for 3D city layout generation.

The paper demonstrates the capability to create high-quality, customizable and infinitely expanding 3D layouts of complex city scenes.
