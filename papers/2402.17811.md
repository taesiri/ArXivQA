# [TruthX: Alleviating Hallucinations by Editing Large Language Models in   Truthful Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17811)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes TruthX, a method to enhance the truthfulness of large language models (LLMs) by editing their internal representations in a "truthful space". 

The key problem addressed is that LLMs sometimes produce fluent and coherent responses that are untruthful or hallucinatory, even when they possess the correct knowledge. This undermines the credibility of LLMs. The paper argues that eliciting truthfulness from a well-trained LLM is an important first step before attempting to inject external knowledge.

The main idea behind TruthX is to decouple the LLM's internal representations into a "semantic space" that captures meaning, and a separate "truthful space". Using an autoencoder architecture and contrastive learning, representations with similar semantics but opposite truth values can be differentiated in the truthful space. 

During inference, TruthX maps an LLM's internal representations to these spaces and edits the activation's in the truthful space to make the LLM more likely to generate truthful responses. This is done using a learned "truthfulness direction" vector. The key benefit is the ability to control truthfulness while preserving semantics and generative capabilities.

Experiments on multiple benchmarks and 13 LLMs show TruthX enhances truthfulness by 20% on average. Further analysis reveals:

- Editing along the truthful direction enhances truthfulness, opposite direction increases hallucinations
- Truthful space generalizes well across homologous LLMs 
- Middle layers of LLMs correlate most with truthfulness

The paper concludes that the truthful space plays a pivotal role in controlling LLM truthfulness. Limitations are that TruthX relies on the LLM's existing knowledge and cannot inject new facts. Further work could combine TruthX with external knowledge.
