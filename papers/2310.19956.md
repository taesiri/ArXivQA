# [The Impact of Depth and Width on Transformer Language Model   Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19956)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes controlling transformer depth and width to study the impact on language model pretraining and compositional generalization, finding that deeper models show better compositional generalization and language modeling even when trading off width to maintain constant parameter count, though benefits saturate quickly.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary:

This paper explores the impact of model depth and width on the compositional generalization abilities of transformer language models. The authors construct model families that trade off depth and width while keeping total parameters constant, finding that deeper models with narrower layers tend to achieve better perplexity and compositional generalization accuracy. However, most of the benefits of depth are gained after just a few layers, with diminishing returns for additional layers. The paper also finds that deeper models generalize better even when controlling for their superior in-distribution performance, suggesting depth provides a direct advantage for compositional generalization. Overall, the results indicate that increasing depth, rather than width alone, improves transformer compositional abilities, though gains saturate quickly. This insight helps explain why standard overparameterized transformers struggle on compositional generalization benchmarks despite their scale, and points towards a promising architectural direction for improving systematic generalization.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper explores how the depth and width of transformer language models impact their ability to generalize compositionally, which is important for interpreting novel sentences. The authors construct model families with the same number of parameters but different depths and widths to isolate the effect of depth, finding that deeper models perform better on both language modeling and compositional generalization benchmarks. However, most benefits are gained from only the first few layers, with diminishing returns and potential degradation as models get very deep and narrow. Analyses show deeper models have lower-rank feed-forward projections, and benefits of depth persist even after controlling for better language modeling and in-distribution performance. Overall, results across multiple model sizes suggest increasing depth, up to a point, better enables compositional generalization independent of total parameter count. The paper provides valuable insights into transformer architectures, showing depth is important for generalization but gains saturate quickly, and very narrow models can become rank-deficient.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper explores the hypothesis that increasing the depth of transformer language models, while keeping the total number of parameters constant, improves their ability to generalize compositionally on out-of-distribution data. The key research questions are:

1) Does increasing depth, independent of total parameter count, improve language modeling performance? 

2) Does increasing depth improve compositional generalization on benchmark datasets?

3) Can any improvements in compositional generalization from increased depth be fully explained by better language modeling performance or better in-distribution fine-tuning accuracy, or does depth provide a direct benefit?

The authors test these hypotheses by constructing families of transformer LMs with the same total parameter counts but varying depth and feed-forward dimensions. They pretrain these models on a language modeling objective, then fine-tune and evaluate them on compositional generalization datasets. To address the third question, they control for differences in language modeling perplexity and in-distribution fine-tuning accuracy when comparing generalization performance. Overall, the paper aims to disentangle the effects of depth and total parameter count on compositional generalization in transformer LMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It constructs transformer language models of varying depths but equal numbers of parameters, by trading off depth and the size of the feedforward dimension. This allows the authors to disentangle the effects of depth and total model size.

- It pretrains these models as language models and fine-tunes them on compositional generalization tasks. The key findings are:

1) Deeper models achieve lower perplexity as language models, though the benefits diminish quickly with more layers. 

2) Deeper models generalize better on compositional tasks, again with diminishing returns. For some tasks performance saturates after only a few layers.

3) The benefits of depth cannot be fully explained by better language modeling performance or lower in-distribution loss on the fine-tuning tasks. Depth seems to directly improve compositional generalization.

- The above findings hold robustly across three model size regimes (41M, 134M, 374M parameters), suggesting depth is beneficial independent of total model size.

In summary, the key contribution is experimentally disentangling the effects of depth and width on compositional generalization, while controlling for model size. The results suggest depth specifically improves generalization, even over and above its benefits for language modeling and in-distribution learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on disentangling the effects of depth and width on transformer model performance. A lot of prior work has studied how overall model size impacts performance, but there has been less controlled work isolating depth and width. The authors create model families with matched parameter counts to isolate depth.

- The use of matched-size model families addresses a limitation in some prior work like Muennighoff et al. (2023) and Tay et al. (2021) that did not control for overall size when varying depth and width. By matching sizes, this work can make clearer conclusions about the role of depth specifically.

- The finding that deeper transformers generalize better aligns with some related theoretical work on model expressivity increasing with depth (Merrill et al. 2021, Raghu et al. 2016). It also agrees with empirical results suggesting depth aids compositional generalization (Mueller et al. 2022, Murty et al. 2022).

- Unlike Veit et al. (2016) and Brown et al. (2022), this work does not find extremely wide/shallow transformers can match deeper ones. The differing conclusions may be due to this work better controlling for overall size.

- The analysis of saturation points and thresholds for benefit of depth connects to ongoing work on relating model inductive biases to performance on different tasks (Kim et al. 2022, Papadimitriou et al. 2023).

- The correction analyses in Section 4 address confounds about pretraining and in-domain performance that affect interpretability of depth's role in generalization. This helps strengthen the claim about direct depth benefits.

In summary, by tightly controlling model size, this work strengthens the evidence that depth specifically aids compositional generalization in transformers beyond just increasing parameters. The analyses also elucidate nuances of these depth benefits.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Conducting multiple runs of each experimental condition to reduce noise in the results, increase confidence in the effect sizes, and quantify uncertainty over the estimates. The paper reports results from a single run per condition due to compute limitations.

- Exploring alternative approaches to controlling for total model size, such as using weight sharing to allow deeper models to have wider feedforward networks without increasing overall parameters. The current approach necessitates making tradeoffs between depth and width.

- Investigating the effect of different pretraining corpora, such as including source code, on compositional generalization. The distribution of pretraining data affects inductive biases.

- Comparing the effect of depth on compositional generalization in fine-tuning versus few-shot in-context learning paradigms. The paper focuses on fine-tuning but notes in-context learning becomes more relevant at very large scales.

- Extending the analysis to even larger model scales, since the benefits of depth may further increase with scale. The largest models studied have 374M parameters.

- Testing modifications to existing compositional datasets to mitigate potential confounders from lexical overlap between pretraining and evaluation data.

- Exploring architectural modifications beyond just depth to improve compositional generalization, such as different layer types or incorporating syntactic inductive biases.

In summary, the main suggested directions are conducting more rigorous experimental evaluations, scaling up the analysis, modifying the training setup, and exploring architectural changes beyond just depth. The authors frame depth as one potentially beneficial factor, but suggest several other avenues for improving compositional generalization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper constructs model families by trading off depth and width while holding total parameter count constant. What motivated this experimental design choice compared to other ways one could control for model size like weight sharing? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of the depth-width tradeoff approach?

2. The paper finds that model performance begins to degrade once the feedforward dimension becomes smaller than the embedding dimension. Why might this happen, and what does it suggest about the role of the feedforward network? Could the authors have avoided this by using other techniques like weight sharing?

3. The paper concludes that increasing depth improves compositional generalization directly, not just via improving pretraining perplexity or in-distribution accuracy. What further analyses could be done to strengthen this conclusion, for example by ruling out other potential mediators? 

4. The benefits of depth seem to diminish quickly, with most of the gains coming from the first few layers. What explanations could account for this rapid saturation? Do you think it generalizes across different model architectures and tasks?

5. The paper uses natural language pretraining, which provides lexical and distributional information that aids generalization. How could the experimental design be altered to remove this potential confound, and how might results change in that case?

6. The paper studies decoder-only rather than encoder-decoder models for computational reasons. What differences would you expect in an encoder-decoder setting? What challenges would arise in studying depth there?

7. The paper uses fine-tuning to adapt models. How feasible would it be to run similar experiments in an in-context learning setting? What challenges would arise there?

8. The paper finds depth continues helping even when models have equivalent pretraining perplexity or in-distribution loss. What other metrics could be used to match model ability aside from perplexity and loss?

9. The paper studies feedforward ratio rather than attention capacity. How would results potentially change if attention capacity varied with depth as well? 

10. The paper studies natural language models. How do you think results might differ if models were pretrained on other modalities like code? Could that provide better inductive biases for compositional tasks?
