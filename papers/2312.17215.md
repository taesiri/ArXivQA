# [Control Barrier Function Based UAV Safety Controller in Autonomous   Airborne Tracking and Following Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17215)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ensuring safe operation of UAVs is critical for mission-critical applications like tracking and following a dynamic target. 
- Collision avoidance becomes challenging when the target UAV is non-cooperative and has unpredictable, erratic movements.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a safety controller based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Quadratic Programs (QPs) to guarantee collision avoidance.
- Design a CBF-QP based filter that takes in desired control inputs from an existing autopilot controller and outputs safe control inputs.
- Formulate the safety condition based on minimum safe distance between the drones. Compute the CBF and lie derivatives based on system dynamics.
- Solve a QP optimization problem to minimally modify control inputs to satisfy safety constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed method ensures safety under arbitrary and backwards movement of the target UAV.
- Formulated a safety filter using CBF-QP that can work with any commercial autopilot software.
- Presented control system design and experimental validation under different target movement scenarios.
- Showed simulations demonstrating safe tracking under straight line forward, straight line backward and arbitrary trajectories.
- Analyzed impact of varying CBF decay rate and position localization latency on performance.

In summary, the paper develops a novel CBF based method to guarantee safe tracking and following of unpredictable dynamic targets. The safety filter is compatible with existing autopilots and experimentally shown to avoid collisions under different scenarios of erratic target motions.
