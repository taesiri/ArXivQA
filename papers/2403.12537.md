# [Prompt-Guided Adaptive Model Transformation for Whole Slide Image   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12537)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Classifying whole slide images (WSIs) is important for histopathology analysis but poses challenges due to the massive size of WSIs. 
- Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a popular approach where a WSI is treated as a bag of patches. However, existing MIL methods typically use pre-trained models without fine-tuning, ignoring the domain shift between natural and histopathological images.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes PAMT, a Prompt-guided Adaptive Model Transformation framework to enhance MIL classification by adapting pre-trained models to histopathology data.

Key Components:
- Representative Patch Sampling (RPS): Efficiently selects the most informative patches from WSIs to focus training on diagnostically relevant data.
- Prototypical Visual Prompt (PVP): Assigns tailored visual prompts to patches to capture the complex distribution of histopathological features. 
- Adaptive Model Transformation (AMT): Integrates adapter blocks into the feature extractor to enable nuanced adaptation from natural to pathological domain.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneers the application of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like visual prompts and adapters for WSI classification.
- Proposes RPS for focused training on informative patches.
- Proposes PVP to handle heterogeneity in histopathology images.
- Proposes AMT for tailored adaptation of pre-trained models.
- Shows consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art MIL methods on two public datasets.

In summary, the paper presents a novel framework PAMT that leverages techniques like visual prompts and adapters to enhance adaptation of pre-trained models for improved WSI classification, outperforming prior arts.
