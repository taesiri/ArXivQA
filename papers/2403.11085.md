# [m&amp;m's: A Benchmark to Evaluate Tool-Use for multi-step multi-modal Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11085)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world multi-modal problems often require computational plans that stitch together multiple machine learning models or tools. However, there is a lack of standardized benchmarks to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate such multi-step, multi-tool plans. 

- Specifically, there are many open questions around planning strategies (e.g. step-by-step vs multi-step), plan formats (e.g. JSON vs Python code), and role of feedback (e.g. parsing vs execution) that existing benchmarks do not support evaluating.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new benchmark called "MNMS" with over 4K multi-modal task queries and automatically generated plans using 33 tools (APIs, models, image processors). 

- Out of these, 1565 high-quality task plans are human-verified to be correctly executable.

- The benchmark allows evaluating different LLM-based planning formulations using metrics like tool-F1, argname-F1 and pass rate. It supports studying impact of planning strategy, plan format, and various types of feedback.

Key Findings:
- Experiments with 6 popular LLMs show multi-step planning outperforms step-by-step planning in tool selection accuracy regardless of model size.  

- Feedback, especially verification and execution, helps improve argument prediction and plan executability but can sometimes hurt tool selection.

- Most models perform comparably on tool selection with JSON vs code but generate more executable plans with JSON.

Main Contributions:
- New "MNMS" benchmark with 4K+ multi-modal tasks and 1.5K+ human-verified executable plans using 33 real-world tools

- Systematic evaluation of 2 planning strategies, 2 plan formats and 3 feedback types with 6 LLMs

- Takeaways suggesting multi-step planning in JSON format with feedback works best for tool-use planning on this benchmark


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark called M&Ms for evaluating tool-using abilities of language models on multi-step, multi-modal tasks, and uses it to systematically study different planning strategies, plan formats, and forms of feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a new benchmark called \name to support comprehensive evaluation of tool-use abilities of planning agents for multi-step, multi-modal tasks. The benchmark contains a large and diverse set of queries and human-verified, executable plans. 

2. Systematically studying the design space of existing tool-use methods by evaluating 6 LLMs with different design choices, including planning formulations, plan formats, and various types of feedback.

3. Revealing three main takeaways from the experiments: (a) current LLMs demonstrate better tool-planning performance on \name with multi-step planning rather than step-by-step planning; (b) generating plans in JSON format leads to better performance than Python code generation; and (c) using parsing, verification, and execution feedback improves performance compared to no feedback.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the \name benchmark and using it to systematically evaluate different design choices for building better tool-using planning agents. The experiments provide suggestions on preferable approaches, like using multi-step planning in JSON format with feedback.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- m&ms benchmark dataset: A new benchmark dataset introduced in the paper for evaluating tool-use abilities of language models for multi-step, multi-modal tasks.

- Multi-step planning: A planning strategy where models generate an entire plan with multiple tool invocations before executing any subtask. Compared to step-by-step planning. 

- Step-by-step planning: A planning strategy where models generate and execute one subtask at a time sequentially. Compared to multi-step planning.

- Feedback mechanisms: Different types of feedback evaluated including parsing, verification, and execution feedback to help models improve their plans.

- Plan formats: Two main plan formats compared - JSON strings that specify tools and arguments vs. free-form Python code.

- Language models: Various language models evaluated including LLaMA, Mixtral, Gemini, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.

- Tool prediction: Ability of models to select the right tools. Evaluated using tool-F1 metric. 

- Argument prediction: Ability of models to specify the right arguments for tools. Evaluated using argname-F1 and argvalue-F1 metrics.

- Executability: Percentage of model predictions that execute successfully without errors. Evaluated using pass rate metric.

The key goals and contributions relate to introducing the benchmark, evaluating different model formulations and feedback types, and providing insights/recommendations on planning agent design choices.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark called \name for evaluating tool-use abilities of planning agents. What are some key advantages of this benchmark compared to prior benchmarks like ToolEmu and TaskBench?

2. The paper studies the impact of different planning strategies like multi-step planning versus step-by-step planning. Why does multi-step planning consistently outperform step-by-step planning across different model sizes? What underlying differences in the approaches lead to this performance gap?

3. The paper examines the role of different forms of feedback like parsing, verification, and execution feedback. How exactly does feedback help improve argument name prediction and plan executability? Why does it sometimes hurt tool selection performance?

4. What are some limitations of using exact string matching for evaluating argument values in this benchmark? How does using textual entailment help address some of those limitations?

5. The paper compares plan formats like JSON versus Python code. Why does JSON format generation lead to much higher pass rates across models? What common execution errors occur with code generation?

6. What modifications could be made to the dataset generation pipeline to support more complex non-sequential plans? What changes would have to be made to the sampling procedure?

7. How suitable is this benchmark for studying other prompt formulations beyond direct instructions and ReAct prompting? What changes would allow the incorporation of more sophisticated prompting strategies? 

8. The paper uses rule-based programs instead of LLMs to obtain ground truth plans. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? How could LLMs still be utilized?

9. What are some ways the benchmark could be expanded to support additional tools beyond the current set of 33 tools? What complexity challenges might arise with a much larger set of tools?

10. How might the benchmark be used by researchers to better understand how different components like planning strategy, forms of feedback, prompt design etc. interact and impact overall performance? What insights do you hope it leads to?
