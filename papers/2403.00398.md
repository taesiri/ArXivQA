# [Learning Quadrupedal Locomotion with Impaired Joints Using Random Joint   Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00398)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Quadrupedal robots can easily lose locomotion functionality if their joints are damaged by external accidents or internal malfunctions. This impairs their ability to safely traverse challenging terrains. Existing methods either lack fault tolerance, require accurate models, or are not validated in the real world. 

Proposed Solution: A deep reinforcement learning framework to enable quadrupedal robots to walk with impaired joints. The framework has 3 main components:

1. Random Joint Masking Strategy: Simulates diverse impaired joint scenarios (e.g. zero torque, locking) by randomly masking joint actions and torques during training.

2. Joint Status Estimator: A student network estimates if each joint is normal or impaired based on observation history, trained via imitation learning from a teacher network with access to privileged information.  

3. Progressive Curriculum Learning: A single policy network is trained to handle both normal and impaired joint gaits. More difficult impairment scenarios are progressively added once performance plateaus on easier curricula. This avoids catastrophic forgetting.

Main Contributions:

- Realistic and diverse simulation of quadruped impairment scenarios 
- Method to estimate joint status from observations
- Curriculum strategy enabling a single network to achieve both normal and impaired locomotion
- Thorough evaluation in simulation, indoors with motion capture, and outdoors with GPS, showing robust impaired locomotion

The proposed framework allows a Unitree Go1 robot to achieve stable locomotion capabilities under various single joint impairment conditions, without needing an accurate model or per-case tuning. This could improve quadruped safety and usefulness for tasks requiring resilience.
