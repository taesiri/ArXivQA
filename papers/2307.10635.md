# [SciBench: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities   of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10635)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How capable are current large language models at solving complex, college-level scientific problems across disciplines like physics, chemistry, and mathematics?

The key hypothesis seems to be:

While large language models have shown impressive performance on simpler mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they still lack the depth of reasoning skills needed to adequately solve advanced scientific problems involving multiple steps of reasoning and complex computations like differentiation and integration.

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called SciBench containing challenging scientific problems from college textbooks and exams. The experiments evaluate the performance of representative LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on these problems under different prompting strategies. The analysis aims to gain a nuanced understanding of where LLMs fall short in scientific problem-solving abilities and what skills need further improvement.

In summary, the central research question is evaluating how capable current LLMs are at complex scientific problem solving, with the hypothesis that there are still considerable limitations compared to human-level performance. The new SciBench benchmark and analysis methodology introduced in the paper provides a way to systematically analyze these capabilities and deficiencies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces SciBench, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating scientific problem solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). SciBench contains two datasets: 

- An open dataset with 695 free-response problems from college-level textbooks in physics, chemistry, and mathematics.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents SciBench, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating the scientific problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). The dataset contains 695 free-response problems collected from college-level textbooks in physics, chemistry, and mathematics, as well as 104 exam questions from computer science and math courses. Experiments were conducted on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using different prompting strategies like zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and prompting the use of external tools like Python and Wolfram Language. The results show current LLMs still struggle on the complex college-level problems, achieving only 35.8% accuracy at best with GPT-4 using both chain-of-thought and Python code prompting. To gain deeper insights, the authors devised an analysis protocol to classify the deficiencies of LLMs into 10 essential scientific problem-solving skills like logical reasoning and calculation. The analysis reveals certain prompting strategies improve some skills more than others, but no single strategy leads to universal enhancement. Overall, this rigorous benchmark sheds light on the limitations of LLMs in scientific reasoning and provides a useful resource to drive future progress.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SciBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the scientific problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). SciBench contains two datasets - an open textbook dataset with 695 free-response problems from college-level science textbooks, and a closed exam dataset with 104 free-response problems from college computer science and math exams. The textbook problems require multiple reasoning steps and complex operations like differentiation and integration, made challenging by sourcing the data from PDF textbooks. 

The authors evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on SciBench using prompting strategies like chain-of-thought and external Python tools. The results show limited performance, with 35.80% accuracy on the textbook dataset even using the best prompting configuration. To analyze the deficiencies, the authors propose an automated self-critique protocol to classify errors into lacking skills like mathematical reasoning or domain knowledge. This analysis reveals flaws in different prompting strategies - while chain-of-thought improves calculation skills, it falters at other abilities, and using Python can compromise code conversion skills. Overall, SciBench highlights considerable room for improvement in LLM scientific problem-solving.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called SciBench to evaluate the scientific problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). The dataset contains 695 free-response, multi-step problems collected from college-level textbooks in physics, chemistry, and math. It also includes 104 exam questions from computer science and math courses. To assess the capabilities of LLMs, the authors test two models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) under different prompting strategies like zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and use of external Python/Wolfram tools. To analyze the errors made by models, they propose a novel protocol using an LLM-based "verifier" to automatically classify the deficiencies into 10 scientific problem-solving skills like logical reasoning or calculation. This enables efficient large-scale analysis of limitations of different prompting strategies instead of costly human annotations. Key findings are that no single strategy universally improves skills, and current LLMs still struggle on complex scientific problems, peaking at only 35.8% accuracy on the textbook dataset even with strongest prompts. Overall, the work introduces a challenging new benchmark to push progress in scientific reasoning abilities of LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is introducing a new benchmark dataset called SciBench to systematically evaluate the scientific problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key issues it aims to address are:

- Many existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs contain problems grounded in junior/senior high school subjects and only involve basic math operations, lacking complexity and depth. 

- Other benchmarks rely on multiple choice questions, which allows models to guess answers from choices rather than demonstrate true comprehension and reasoning.

- Detailed solutions are often not provided, preventing analysis of why models make certain errors. 

- Benchmark problems are sometimes sourced from online material, risking overlap with training data and inadvertently "teaching to the test".

To mitigate these issues, SciBench contributes a carefully curated set of free-response, college-level problems from science textbooks and course exams. The dataset comprises open-ended questions that require multi-step reasoning and complex computations like calculus. Detailed solutions are included to enable in-depth error analysis. The data has been manually extracted and processed to avoid training set overlap. 

In summary, SciBench aims to create a more systematic, rigorous benchmark to assess the advanced scientific problem-solving capabilities of LLMs, reveal their limitations, and catalyze further progress in this domain.
