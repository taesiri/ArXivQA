# [SAFARI: Versatile and Efficient Evaluations for Robustness of   Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09418)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we systematically evaluate the robustness of explanations/interpretations from deep learning models against adversarial perturbations?

The authors highlight two key issues:

1) Explanations can be fooled or manipulated by small adversarial perturbations to the input, even if the model prediction remains unchanged. This indicates a lack of robustness in the explanation methods.

2) There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation metrics and methods to systematically assess the robustness of explanations from different explanation techniques. 

To address these issues, the authors propose:

- Two new evaluation metrics: worst-case interpretation discrepancy and probabilistic interpretation robustness. These provide complementary perspectives.

- Efficient estimation methods for the metrics based on genetic algorithms and subset simulation. These are applicable to diverse explanation methods in a black-box manner.

- Demonstrate the utility of the proposed techniques on tasks like ranking explanation methods by robustness and selecting training schemes to improve robustness.

So in summary, the main research contribution is a comprehensive and versatile evaluation framework to assess the robustness of explanations against adversarial manipulations. This provides a way to benchmark different explanation techniques and select models/training methods that improve robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing two new evaluation methods for assessing the robustness of interpretations from deep learning models. Specifically:

1. They propose two new metrics - a worst case interpretation discrepancy and a probabilistic interpretation robustness metric. These provide different perspectives on evaluating robustness compared to existing metrics. 

2. They develop new black-box evaluation methods based on genetic algorithms (GA) and subset simulation (SS) to estimate these metrics efficiently. These are applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous explainable AI methods.

3. They design the GA and SS methods specifically to handle the challenges of: diverse XAI methods, misinterpretations being rare events, and working with high dimensional image data. This includes bespoke fitness functions in GA and encoding auxiliary information as intermediate events in SS.

4. They demonstrate applications of the evaluation methods on: ranking XAI methods by robustness, and selecting training schemes to improve robustness of both classification and interpretation.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be in proposing new robustness metrics and tailored GA/SS methods to estimate them efficiently in a black-box manner for diverse XAI techniques. The results show the proposed methods outperform existing approaches in accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes two black-box evaluation methods based on Genetic Algorithm and Subset Simulation to assess the robustness of deep learning model interpretations from both worst-case and probabilistic perspectives; the methods introduce new metrics complementing existing ones and can efficiently handle the challenges of heterogeneous XAI techniques and detecting rare misinterpretation events.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents novel methods for evaluating the robustness of interpretations from deep learning models. Here are some key ways it compares to other related works:

- It proposes two new metrics - worst-case interpretation discrepancy and probabilistic interpretation robustness - to quantify robustness from complementary perspectives. Prior works have mostly focused on adversarial attacks to fool interpretations, binary notions of robustness, or worst-case metrics like Lipschitz continuity. 

- The methods use genetic algorithms and subset simulation to efficiently estimate the new metrics in a black-box manner for any type of interpretable model. This is a key advantage over white-box gradient-based approaches that are model-specific. The estimators are tailored to detect rare misinterpretation events.

- The paper demonstrates applications of the evaluation methods, like ranking XAI techniques and selecting training schemes to improve robustness. This goes beyond just attack/defense and provides practical guidance on model selection and training.

- It provides both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on accuracy, sensitivity, and efficiency compared to baselines. The results validate the claimed advantages of the proposed techniques.

- The work focuses on feature attribution methods for image data, while some related papers have looked at specific model types like tree ensembles or tabular data. But the black-box metrics and estimators are generalizable.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the nascent field of XAI evaluation. The novel metrics and efficient black-box methods address limitations of current approaches. The applications and analysis provide valuable insights into model robustness. This looks like an impactful advancement that bridges key gaps in the literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more comprehensive and diverse evaluation metrics for interpretation robustness. The authors note that existing metrics mainly focus on worst-case analysis, but probabilistic metrics assessing the overall robustness are also needed. They propose some initial metrics but suggest more work is needed here.

- Studying the robustness of perturbation-based XAI methods like LIME and SHAP more thoroughly. The authors provide some initial experiments but note the complexity of these methods warrants more comprehensive evaluation.

- Further analyzing the relationship between classification robustness and interpretation robustness, both theoretically and empirically. The authors derive some initial theoretical results and show correlations experimentally, but suggest more work is needed to fully understand this relationship.

- Evaluating the robustness of XAI methods on more complex real-world models beyond the datasets studied in the paper. The authors demonstrate applications on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA but suggest extending the analysis to larger models trained on datasets like ImageNet would be useful.

- Developing specialized training methods and regularizers to improve both classification and interpretation robustness simultaneously. The authors show promising results with some regularizers but suggest exploring this direction more fully.

- Integrating the proposed evaluation methods into standardized XAI evaluation toolkits and benchmarks that are emerging, to complement other metrics and tests.

In summary, the main directions focus on developing more comprehensive evaluation approaches for interpretation robustness, understanding the link between classification and interpretation robustness, and using these methods to improve robustness through model training and selection of XAI techniques. More complex real-world applications are also suggested to further validate the utility of the methods.
