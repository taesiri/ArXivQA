# [SAFARI: Versatile and Efficient Evaluations for Robustness of   Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09418)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we systematically evaluate the robustness of explanations/interpretations from deep learning models against adversarial perturbations?

The authors highlight two key issues:

1) Explanations can be fooled or manipulated by small adversarial perturbations to the input, even if the model prediction remains unchanged. This indicates a lack of robustness in the explanation methods.

2) There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation metrics and methods to systematically assess the robustness of explanations from different explanation techniques. 

To address these issues, the authors propose:

- Two new evaluation metrics: worst-case interpretation discrepancy and probabilistic interpretation robustness. These provide complementary perspectives.

- Efficient estimation methods for the metrics based on genetic algorithms and subset simulation. These are applicable to diverse explanation methods in a black-box manner.

- Demonstrate the utility of the proposed techniques on tasks like ranking explanation methods by robustness and selecting training schemes to improve robustness.

So in summary, the main research contribution is a comprehensive and versatile evaluation framework to assess the robustness of explanations against adversarial manipulations. This provides a way to benchmark different explanation techniques and select models/training methods that improve robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing two new evaluation methods for assessing the robustness of interpretations from deep learning models. Specifically:

1. They propose two new metrics - a worst case interpretation discrepancy and a probabilistic interpretation robustness metric. These provide different perspectives on evaluating robustness compared to existing metrics. 

2. They develop new black-box evaluation methods based on genetic algorithms (GA) and subset simulation (SS) to estimate these metrics efficiently. These are applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous explainable AI methods.

3. They design the GA and SS methods specifically to handle the challenges of: diverse XAI methods, misinterpretations being rare events, and working with high dimensional image data. This includes bespoke fitness functions in GA and encoding auxiliary information as intermediate events in SS.

4. They demonstrate applications of the evaluation methods on: ranking XAI methods by robustness, and selecting training schemes to improve robustness of both classification and interpretation.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be in proposing new robustness metrics and tailored GA/SS methods to estimate them efficiently in a black-box manner for diverse XAI techniques. The results show the proposed methods outperform existing approaches in accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes two black-box evaluation methods based on Genetic Algorithm and Subset Simulation to assess the robustness of deep learning model interpretations from both worst-case and probabilistic perspectives; the methods introduce new metrics complementing existing ones and can efficiently handle the challenges of heterogeneous XAI techniques and detecting rare misinterpretation events.
