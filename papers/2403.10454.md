# [Partially Observable Task and Motion Planning with Uncertainty and Risk   Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Integrated task and motion planning (TAMP) has been successful for generalizable long-horizon robotic manipulation and navigation. However, typical TAMP formulations assume deterministic action effects and full state observability. These limitations preclude handling uncertainty, gathering information, and avoiding undesirable outcomes.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes TAMP with Uncertainty and Risk Awareness (TAMPURA), an approach capable of efficiently solving long-horizon planning problems involving:
1) Initial state and action outcome uncertainty
2) Need for active information gathering
3) Avoiding irreversible, undesirable outcomes

The key ideas are:

1) Reason about uncertainty at both abstract task level and continuous controller level 
2) Given goal-conditioned controllers operating in primitive action space, learn a high-level abstraction that can be solved efficiently and refined to actions
3) Partition continuous probabilistic belief space into discrete abstract belief space
4) Consider operators with preconditions, guaranteed effects, and possible uncertain effects  
5) Learn factored outcome distributions from small numbers of simulated trials

Main Contributions:

1) A TAMP method that handles non-deterministic transitions, enabling risk-aware planning 
2) An approach to efficiently learn stochastic belief-space transition models through guided simulation
3) Ability to specify belief-space controllers, increasing robustness and expressivity
4) Demonstrated flexibility by solving various manipulation and navigation tasks involving different types of uncertainty
5) Showed that uncertainty models can be attained from perception in real-world context for efficient and safe planning

In summary, the paper presents a novel TAMP technique to handle uncertainty and risk, leveraging learned models and belief-space controllers. It demonstrates the approach on a diverse set of simulated and real robot tasks needing reasoning about uncertainty.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for efficient long-horizon robot planning under uncertainty by learning a factored transition model over high-level robot controllers and solving the resulting belief-space MDP using optimistic deterministic search to guide probabilistic simulation and model learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new approach to task and motion planning under uncertainty called TAMPURA (TAMP with Uncertainty and Risk Awareness). The key ideas and contributions include:

1) Allowing for a non-deterministic high-level transition model in the task planner, which enables the planner to consider multiple possible outcomes of actions, including those with low probability but high risk. 

2) Efficiently learning factored outcome distributions from a small number of simulated trials, as opposed to using hand-engineered parameterized outcome distributions.

3) Supporting the specification of belief-space controllers, which increases robustness and expressivity of the low-level action primitives.

4) Demonstrating the flexibility of the planning framework on a range of robotics tasks involving different types of uncertainty like classification uncertainty, sensor noise, partial observability, grasp uncertainty, outcome uncertainty due to unknown physics, and localization uncertainty.

5) Showing that models of uncertainty can be reliably attained from perception systems and used for efficient and safe decision making in real-world robot tasks involving partial observability and human interaction.

In summary, the main contribution is a new approach to task and motion planning that explicitly reasons about uncertainty and risk, efficiently learns probabilistic models, and works with belief-space controllers to enable planning in real-world robotics applications.

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts in this paper include:

- Integrated task and motion planning (TAMP)

The paper proposes an approach to task and motion planning that can handle uncertainty, risk, partial observability, and long time horizons. It uses learned stochastic models at both the high-level task planning level and lower-level motion planning level. The key ideas include using deterministic plans to guide model learning, Bayesian updates to learn outcome distributions, employing a set of closed-loop controllers, and progressively expanding the space of continuous parameters for these controllers. The overall aim is efficient and safe planning that is robust to uncertainties and enables information gathering and risk avoidance when needed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new extension to PDDL for specifying controllers with uncertain effects. How does this language extension allow the expression of preconditions, guaranteed effects, and possible uncertain effects? What are the limitations of this language?

2. The paper uses a Bayesian optimistic sampling strategy for model learning. How does this approach balance exploration and exploitation compared to simpler strategies like Îµ-greedy exploration or sampling from the optimal MDP policy? What theoretical guarantees does Bayesian optimistic sampling provide? 

3. The paper claims that deterministic planning in belief space struggles with irreversible outcomes and higher observational branching factors. Why is this the case? When would a deterministic approach be sufficient compared to the proposed fully probabilistic planning method?

4. What assumptions does the proposed method make about the accuracy of the model of uncertainty and the specification of belief-space controllers? How could these assumptions be relaxed in future work to make the approach more general? 

5. The paper proposes an approach to handle continuous parameters for controllers using progressive widening. How does this approach work and why is it useful compared to grounding all possible parameter values? What hyperparameters control the expansion rate?

6. What is the stationarity condition required for the abstract belief-state MDP to be well-defined? What happens when this condition does not perfectly hold? How could the analysis be extended to non-stationary abstractions?

7. The paper claims that model learning guided by optimistic deterministic plans is more sample efficient than simpler approaches. Empirically demonstrate this claim using simulations. How much more sample efficient is the proposed approach?

8. Why can't probabilistic state-space approaches like POMCP be fairly compared to the proposed method? What modifications would need to be made to enable a fair comparison? How would you expect such a comparison to turn out?

9. The real-world experiments use probabilistic perception and occupancy grids. How do these components enable the robot to reason about safety and human interaction? What failure modes occur in the real-world deployment? 

10. What major assumptions need to be relaxed to make the proposed approach practical for real-world deployment? What future work directions could address resolving these assumptions?
