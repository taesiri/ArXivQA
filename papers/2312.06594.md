# [Mitigating Perspective Distortion-induced Shape Ambiguity in Image Crops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06594)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper identifies and analyzes a subtle ambiguity that arises when making 3D inferences from image crops of objects undergoing perspective distortion, referred to as the Perspective Distortion-induced Shape Ambiguity in Image Crops. Through intuitive examples with parallelepipeds and circles, they show that image crops with similar 2D appearance can correspond to objects with very different 3D shapes and poses, especially when the crops are taken from different locations in the image. To help neural networks resolve this ambiguity, they propose an Intrinsics-Aware Positional Encoding (IAPE) that captures the location of the crop in the cameraâ€™s field of view by encoding the angle each pixel makes with the principal point. They demonstrate the effectiveness of IAPE on three tasks - 3D pose estimation of articulated objects, dense depth prediction, and 3D object detection. Across these applications, incorporating information about the crop location consistently improves performance over strong baselines. The identification of the crop ambiguity and the proposed IAPE encoding to mitigate it are the main contributions of this work.
