# [TON-VIO: Online Time Offset Modeling Networks for Robust Temporal   Alignment in High Dynamic Motion VIO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12504)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Temporal misalignment (time offset) between sensors is common in low-cost visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, which introduces inconsistent constraints for state estimation and leads to significant positioning drift, especially in high dynamic motion scenarios. Existing online temporal calibration methods rely on either accurate state estimation or stable visual tracking, which are difficult to maintain in challenging real-world conditions. Additionally, current approaches oversimplify the time offset as a constant value with white Gaussian noise, conflicting with its actual time-varying physical evolution pattern.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes online time offset modeling networks (TON) to enhance temporal calibration for high dynamic motion VIO. TON contains two components:

1) Feature velocity observation networks (FVON): Designed to effectively predict the velocity of poorly tracked features which lack sufficient observations. This allows more features to be utilized for time offset observation modeling. FVON contains two modules - inverse time series FVON to leverage future observations and frame-to-frame FVON to capture motion patterns between consecutive frames.

2) Time offset prediction networks (TPN): Learns to predict the evolution pattern of the time offset over time based on historical estimates. This enhances the prediction modeling instead of simply modeling it as a constant value.

TON is integrated into both optimization-based and filter-based VIO frameworks to improve time offset estimation. The networks are trained online using weak supervision from current visual measurements and past states.

Main Contributions:

- Novel online weakly-supervised learning technique TON to enhance time offset modeling for high dynamic motion VIO
- FVON to effectively predict velocities of poorly tracked features for time offset observation  
- TPN to learn actual evolution pattern of time offset over time for its prediction
- Demonstrated performance improvement on both simulation and real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods

In summary, this paper presents a new learning-based technique to achieve more accurate and robust online temporal calibration for high dynamic motion VIO systems by enhancing the observation and prediction modeling of the time offset. Experiments validate its advantages over existing methods.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing novel online weakly-supervised learning networks called TON (online time offset modeling networks) to enhance temporal calibration and reduce the positioning drift caused by time-varying temporal misalignment between camera and IMU sensors in high dynamic motion visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems. Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) Feature velocity observation networks (FVON) to effectively infer the velocity of poorly tracked features to strengthen the time offset observation modeling. 

2) Time offset prediction networks (TPN) to learn the evolution pattern of time offset over time and enhance its prediction modeling. 

3) Integration of the proposed FVON and TPN into both optimization-based and filter-based VIO systems to improve time offset estimation and overall positioning performance, which is demonstrated through simulations and real-world experiments.

The key innovation is using online weakly-supervised learning to model time offset for robust temporal calibration in challenging high dynamic motion scenarios for VIO. This addresses limitations of existing methods that rely on accurate state estimation or stable feature tracking.
