# [Privacy-preserving quantum federated learning via gradient hiding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Standard federated learning protocols are susceptible to gradient inversion attacks where an honest-but-curious server can extract clients' private data from the gradients they submit during training. This is a major privacy concern.

- Classical protection mechanisms like homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and secret sharing have significant overhead in computation, communication costs, and impact on model accuracy. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two types of quantum federated learning protocols assisted by quantum communication to address the privacy issue while optimizing communication costs. 

- Protocol 1 formulates model aggregation as a inner product estimation task between server and clients. A blind quantum bipartite correlator (BQBC) algorithm is presented that builds upon encoding gradient information into quantum states. This protocol has communication complexity of Õ(md/ɛ) outperforming analogous classical secret sharing method.

- Protocol 2 is based on principles of incremental learning to accumulate gradients across clients. Two sub-protocols are given - one using globally entangled GHZ states and another based on secure multiparty summation through phase encoding. Both ensure server receives only the aggregated information.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to develop efficient and privacy-preserving quantum federated learning protocols with analysis of quantum communication costs.

- A BQBC algorithm extended to the multi-client setting while ensuring information-theoretic privacy against malicious server. An efficient redundant encoding technique further improves privacy.  

- Novel gradient aggregation techniques similar to incremental learning that leverage quantum states and phase estimation to completely hide individual gradients from the server.

- Demonstration that quantum communication provides inherent privacy advantages in distributed computing scenarios, motivating further research into quantum machine learning protocols.
