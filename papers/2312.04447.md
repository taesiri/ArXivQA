# [Privacy-preserving quantum federated learning via gradient hiding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04447)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes innovative quantum protocols utilizing quantum communication to address privacy concerns in federated learning. Rather than relying on expensive classical techniques like homomorphic encryption or compromising utility via differential privacy, the authors put forth two types of gradient-hidden federated learning protocols to conceal individual client gradients from the central server. The first protocol transforms the aggregation task into a private inner product estimation problem and leverages a blind quantum bipartite correlator algorithm to achieve a communication complexity quadratic in the number of clients compared to analogous classical secret sharing schemes. The second protocol draws on incremental learning concepts by accumulating gradient information in quantum states transmitted between clients, such that the server only receives the aggregated sum. An analysis of the communication costs demonstrates that both protocols offer substantial improvements over baseline classical approaches in preserving privacy while optimizing efficiency. Overall, this work makes important strides toward realizing secure and practical distributed quantum machine learning, paving the way for further development of privacy-preserving algorithms and distributed quantum computing protocols.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents innovative quantum protocols with quantum communication designed to address the federated learning problem, strengthen privacy measures against gradient inversion attacks, and optimize communication efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes two types of protocols for privacy-preserving federated learning using quantum communication:

1. Protocols based on private inner product estimation. A key protocol here leverages the blind quantum bipartite correlator (BQBC) algorithm to securely estimate the inner product between the server's weights and clients' gradients. This achieves a communication complexity quadratic in the number of clients compared to classical secret sharing schemes.

2. Protocols based on the concept of incremental learning to perform secure multiparty gradient summation. One protocol uses phase encoding with globally entangled GHZ states while another relies on sequential transmission of quantum states to accumulate gradients. 

The main contribution is introducing these innovative quantum communication-based federated learning protocols to address privacy concerns with gradient inversion attacks. The protocols aim to optimize communication efficiency while preserving privacy, without compromising model accuracy. By hiding individual gradient information using quantum states, they open up new strategies for secure distributed quantum machine learning.

In summary, the paper puts forth efficient protocols for gradient-hidden quantum federated learning to enable distributed quantum machine learning with enhanced privacy and low communication overheads.
