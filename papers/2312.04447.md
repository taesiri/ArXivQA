# [Privacy-preserving quantum federated learning via gradient hiding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04447)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes innovative quantum protocols utilizing quantum communication to address privacy concerns in federated learning. Rather than relying on expensive classical techniques like homomorphic encryption or compromising utility via differential privacy, the authors put forth two types of gradient-hidden federated learning protocols to conceal individual client gradients from the central server. The first protocol transforms the aggregation task into a private inner product estimation problem and leverages a blind quantum bipartite correlator algorithm to achieve a communication complexity quadratic in the number of clients compared to analogous classical secret sharing schemes. The second protocol draws on incremental learning concepts by accumulating gradient information in quantum states transmitted between clients, such that the server only receives the aggregated sum. An analysis of the communication costs demonstrates that both protocols offer substantial improvements over baseline classical approaches in preserving privacy while optimizing efficiency. Overall, this work makes important strides toward realizing secure and practical distributed quantum machine learning, paving the way for further development of privacy-preserving algorithms and distributed quantum computing protocols.
