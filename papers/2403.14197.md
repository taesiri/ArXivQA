# [Context Quality Matters in Training Fusion-in-Decoder for Extractive   Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval-augmented generation models use additional relevant passages (context) to improve performance on knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering. 
- Prior work showed context quantity and quality impact model performance at inference time.
- However, it's not well understood how context characteristics during training affect the trained model's performance.

Methods & Contributions:
- The authors investigate how context quantity and quality during training affect Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) models on extractive open-domain QA. 
- Key findings:
    - FiD models overfit to context quality during training, performing worse on different context quality at test time.  
    - Overfitting is less for context quantity.
    - Models trained on higher quality context attend more uniformly to passages, while lower quality training causes more selective attention.
- Based on these insights, the authors propose a method to adapt a trained model to different context quality at test time by controlling cross-attention selectivity.

Experiments:
- Natural Questions and TriviaQA extractive QA datasets used.
- Vary context quantity and quality during FiD model training.
- Evaluate on contexts with different quantity/quality.
- Analyze cross-attention patterns. 
- Show proposed attention regularization method mitigates overfitting.

Conclusion:
- Context quality significantly impacts FiD training and causes overfitting. 
- Controlling selectivity of attention can help adapt models and improve robustness to varying context quality.
- Further research needed on how other context characteristics affect training.
