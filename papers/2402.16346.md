# [Boosting Graph Pooling with Persistent Homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16346)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Boosting Graph Pooling with Persistent Homology":

Problem Statement
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have limitations in capturing certain topological structures like cycles in graphs. Meanwhile, graph pooling (GP) methods coarsen graphs without preserving meaningful topology, which impairs subsequent GNN layers.   

- Prior works have tried to incorporate topological features from persistent homology (PH) into GNNs, but this results in marginal improvements as it is still unclear how to properly integrate PH.

Key Idea and Methods
- The paper first observes an alignment between PH and GP - both coarsen a graph hierarchically in a cut-off manner.

- Motivated by this, the paper develops a method called Topology-Invariant Pooling (TIP) to inject PH into GP at both feature and topology levels:
  - Feature level: Vectorize PH diagram as supplementary node features.
  - Topology level: 
    - Resample coarsened graph from GP to make it adaptable for PH.
    - Re-weight graph with persistence to emphasize persistent topology.
    - Add a topology-preserving loss to regularize topological similarity between layers.

- TIP can be flexibly integrated with various GP methods like DiffPool, MinCutPool, etc.

Key Results
- Experiments show TIP consistently improves pooling methods in preserving topological structures and performs substantially better on downstream tasks like graph classification.

- Analyses demonstrate that TIP has higher expressivity than GP methods and the preserved topology indeed contributes to performance gain.

Main Contributions
- First work to investigate aligning PH with GP and propose an effective integration mechanism.
- New topology-preserving loss function for GP methods.
- Extensive experiments verify wide applicability of TIP across datasets and pooling methods.
