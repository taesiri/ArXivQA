# [Genetic Algorithm for Constrained Molecular Inverse Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03518v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop a genetic algorithm for constrained molecular inverse design that can effectively optimize target molecular properties while adhering to structural similarity constraints? 

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel genetic algorithm that can:

- Generate valid molecular structures that satisfy similarity constraints during crossover and mutation operations.

- Optimize target properties like penalized logP through a two-phase optimization approach - first satisfy structural constraints, then optimize properties.

- Maintain core molecular scaffolds during optimization to preserve bioactivity. 

The key hypothesis is that this two-phase constrained optimization approach will allow effective exploration of the chemical space to identify molecules with desired target properties and structural similarity to known active compounds. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm at optimizing properties under different similarity constraints compared to other methods.

In summary, the central research contribution is a new genetic algorithm for constrained molecular inverse design that can effectively balance optimizing target pharmacological properties while adhering to structural constraints. The paper aims to demonstrate the capabilities of this algorithm through comparative experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a novel genetic algorithm for constrained optimization in molecular inverse design. The algorithm can generate valid molecules that satisfy structural constraints through the use of graph and SELFIES molecular descriptors.

- Introducing a two-phase optimization process to ensure the algorithm optimizes for target properties while adhering to structural constraints. In the first phase, it searches for feasible solutions satisfying the constraints. In the second phase, it performs bi-objective optimization of the property and constraints.

- Demonstrating through experiments that the algorithm can effectively optimize molecules for properties like penalized logP while constraining structural similarity to a target molecule. It outperforms several baseline models on this task.

- Showing an application of the algorithm to optimize cannabidiol molecules while retaining their core scaffold structure. The optimized molecules improve penalized logP while mostly preserving the scaffold.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel genetic algorithm that can perform constrained optimization for molecular inverse design and generate optimized and valid molecules adhering to structural constraints. The two-phase optimization and use of graph/SELFIES descriptors helps achieve this.
