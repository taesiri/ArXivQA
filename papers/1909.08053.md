# [Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using   Model Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can simple model parallelism techniques enable training of transformer-based language models with billions of parameters, using existing PyTorch frameworks without custom compilers or libraries?2) How does model scaling impact accuracy on downstream NLP tasks for both left-to-right transformers like GPT-2 and bidirectional transformers like BERT? 3) Can careful rearrangement of layer normalization in BERT-style transformers enable continued accuracy improvements with increased model size, overcoming limitations noted in prior work?4) Can scaled up versions of GPT-2 and BERT establish new state-of-the-art results on benchmark NLP datasets?The authors aim to demonstrate that with their proposed simple model parallel approach, they can efficiently train very large transformer models on existing frameworks. They also want to empirically show that bigger models lead to better accuracy on downstream tasks, for both GPT-2 and BERT architectures. A key hypothesis is that modifying layer normalization in BERT can enable this increased performance with model scaling. The overarching goal is to push state-of-the-art results on NLP benchmarks by training the largest GPT-2 and BERT models to date.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large-scale transformer language models be efficiently trained using model parallelism, and do larger models result in improved performance on downstream natural language tasks?Specifically, the authors aim to:- Implement an efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters, using only minimal modifications to existing PyTorch code.- Empirically analyze the scaling efficiency of their approach up to 512 GPUs. - Study the effect of scaling up model size on the accuracy of downstream tasks, for both GPT-2 and BERT-style models.- Show that properly rearranging layer normalization in BERT-style models is critical for good accuracy as model size increases.- Demonstrate state-of-the-art results using their largest GPT-2 (8.3 billion parameters) and BERT (3.9 billion parameters) models on several language modeling datasets and tasks.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that larger transformer language models, trained efficiently via model parallelism, can achieve improved performance on language tasks. The paper aims to demonstrate this through empirical analysis and state-of-the-art results using their proposed training method.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in language modeling and large-scale model training:- Scale of Models Trained: This paper trains extremely large language models, up to 8.3 billion parameters. This is significantly larger than previous work like BERT and GPT-2, which were in the hundreds of millions of parameters. The scale demonstrates the capability of their proposed model parallel approach.- Model Parallelism Approach: The model parallel approach in this paper is simple and requires minimal code changes compared to existing frameworks like Mesh TensorFlow. It shows model parallelism can be efficient without complex compilation and execution frameworks. However, other work has shown more optimized pipelining approaches. - Scaling Efficiency: The paper demonstrates good scaling efficiency up to 512 GPUs. Other work has shown higher efficiency but for smaller model sizes. This paper pushes parallel efficiency to unprecedented model sizes.- Model Architectures: This paper trains both auto-regressive (GPT-style) and auto-encoding (BERT-style) transformer models. Most prior work focused on one or the other. The techniques apply to both broad model families.- Rearranging BERT Architecture: An important finding is that rearranging BERT's layers improves scaling. This was not explored in detail before and is important for training huge BERT models.- State-of-the-Art Results: The large models achieve new state-of-the-art results on several language modeling datasets, demonstrating the value of scale. However, other techniques like sparse attention also improve results.Overall, this paper makes solid contributions in training giant language models using simple but efficient model parallelism. The scale and efficiency results are impressive. However, there is still much room for innovation in frameworks, optimizations, and alternate approaches to large-scale modeling.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key things to compare and contrast about this paper with other research in model parallelism for large language models:- The approach taken is simple and efficient, only requiring a few modifications to existing PyTorch transformer code rather than a whole new compiler or framework like some other works. This makes it more accessible.- It focuses on intra-layer model parallelism specifically, whereas pipeline model parallelism as in GPipe is a separate approach. The authors position their method as complementary to pipeline techniques.- The scaling results they demonstrate up to 8.3 billion parameters on 512 GPUs are quite impressive. Other works may not have achieved the same level of strong and weak scaling efficiency. - They provide a thorough empirical analysis of how model performance improves with size, including adjusting BERT to continue improving with size. Other works like ALBERT found degradement beyond a point.- The model sizes trained and the resulting SOTA results achieved set new benchmarks compared to previous bests, especially in the bi-directional BERT-style model.- The code and training pipelines are open sourced, allowing replication and extension by others. Other model parallel works may not have released code.So in summary, this paper pushes forward model parallelism for transformers in terms of efficiency, scaling, model sizes achieved, model quality improvements, and practical accessibility of the methods. The empirical analyses and new SOTA results help validate the usefulness of the approaches proposed.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Continuing to scale up pretraining by training even larger language models. The authors mention going up to 16 billion or more parameters would require hybrid intra-layer and inter-layer model parallelism.- Pretraining different model architectures besides transformers, like XLNet and T5.- Evaluating performance of large pretrained models on more difficult and diverse downstream tasks beyond GLUE - e.g. question answering, summarization, conversation.- Using knowledge distillation to train smaller student models that can mimic the capabilities of the very large teacher models.- Improving efficiency and reducing memory footprint of optimizers to enable larger batch sizes and model sizes.- Exploring model parallel training of other model families besides transformers, like RNNs.- Combining model parallelism with pipeline model parallelism techniques like in GPipe to further increase scale.So in summary, the main directions are around continuing to scale model size, evaluating on more tasks, using distillation, improving optimization and efficiency, and expanding beyond just transformers. The authors see model parallelism as enabling continued progress in pretraining by overcoming memory limitations.
