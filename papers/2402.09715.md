# [DPBalance: Efficient and Fair Privacy Budget Scheduling for Federated   Learning as a Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09715)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed machine learning approach that enables collaborative model training without aggregating raw data. Cloud service providers offer Federated Learning as a Service (FLaaS) platforms that allow data analysts to execute FL training pipelines on differentially private data from crowdsourced data owners. Due to the properties of differential privacy, the privacy budgets set by data owners need to be carefully scheduled to improve efficiency and fairness across data analysts' pipelines. Existing works consider either efficiency or fairness, but not both.

Solution:
This paper proposes DPBalance, the first privacy budget scheduling mechanism that jointly optimizes for both efficiency and fairness. 

A utility function is developed that incorporates dominant shares to calculate data analyst-level fairness and platform-level efficiency. FL-specific metrics like data-pipeline matching degree and pipeline delay time are also integrated. 

A sequential allocation algorithm is designed using Lagrange multipliers and greedy heuristics to maximize the utility function. The original mixed integer optimization problem is decomposed into two sub-problems - allocate budgets across data analysts, then reallocate to pipelines within each analyst.

Contributions:

- First work to consider both efficiency and fairness in FLaaS privacy budget scheduling

- Comprehensive utility function capturing efficiency, fairness and FL-specific metrics  

- Algorithm design using Lagrange multipliers and effective greedy heuristics

- Theoretical proofs for desired economic properties: Pareto Efficiency, Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Weak Strategy Proofness

- Discovered and proved theoretically the fairness-efficiency tradeoff in privacy budgeting

- Superior empirical performance over baselines, improving efficiency by 1.44-3.49x and fairness by 1.37-24.32x on average

In summary, the paper addresses the open challenge of joint efficiency and fairness optimization for privacy budget scheduling in FLaaS platforms with a novel mechanism and extensive theoretical and empirical validation.
