# [Improving Commonsense in Vision-Language Models via Knowledge Graph   Riddles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16504)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question being addressed is: How can we improve the commonsense ability of recent popular vision-language (VL) models?

The authors observe that despite the great success of VL models like CLIP, they still lack commonsense knowledge and reasoning ability. For example, when shown an image of a lemon and given the text "It tastes sour", VL models fail to make the connection that the text is referring to the lemon. 

To address this limitation, the authors propose a new training strategy called "Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph linearization for CommonsensE capability" (DANCE). The key idea is to leverage knowledge graphs like ConceptNet to generate new training examples that inject commonsense knowledge into existing VL datasets. This helps teach the models about relationships and connections between entities during training.

Additionally, the authors create a new diagnostic benchmark to evaluate commonsense ability in a retrieval task setting, allowing comparison across different VL model architectures.

Through experiments, they show DANCE significantly improves performance on commonsense tasks while maintaining accuracy on normal retrieval benchmarks. This demonstrates it enhances commonsense capabilities without sacrificing general visual-linguistic understanding.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that augmenting training data with commonsense knowledge graphs can improve the commonsense reasoning abilities of VL models. The DANCE strategy and diagnostic benchmark are proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper proposes a novel training strategy called DANCE (Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph linearization for CommonsensE capability) to improve the commonsense ability of vision-language (VL) models. DANCE generates commonsense-augmented image-text pairs by leveraging knowledge graphs and creating variants of text descriptions in existing VL datasets via bidirectional sub-graph sequentialization. 

2. The paper introduces a new retrieval-based commonsense diagnostic benchmark to evaluate VL models' commonsense ability. This allows direct evaluation of VL models without transferring to other tasks like VQA. The benchmark has test splits to evaluate both seen and unseen commonsense knowledge.

3. Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that the proposed DANCE strategy significantly improves VL models' commonsense ability as evaluated by both the new diagnostic benchmark and existing VQA datasets, without harming performance on vanilla image-text retrieval tasks. The results show DANCE helps VL models generalize to unseen commonsense knowledge as well.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing a novel commonsense training strategy compatible with many VL models, introducing a new diagnostic benchmark for evaluating commonsense, and empirically demonstrating effectiveness of the approach. The overall contribution is improving and analyzing the commonsense ability of VL models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to improve the commonsense capability of vision-language models by augmenting existing image-text datasets with commonsense knowledge extracted from knowledge graphs and converting it to natural language descriptions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in improving the commonsense reasoning ability of vision-language models:

- Focus: This paper focuses specifically on improving commonsense reasoning in vision-language models by augmenting training data with knowledge graphs. Other work has explored different approaches like multi-task learning, incorporating external knowledge in model architectures, etc.

- Data Augmentation Strategy: The proposed DANCE strategy uses knowledge graph riddles to augment existing vision-language datasets. This is a scalable data-centric approach. Other work has created new datasets for commonsense reasoning which can be more costly.

- Compatibility: A key benefit of DANCE is it's compatible with many existing vision-language models without architectural changes. Other techniques may require custom models. 

- Evaluation: The paper introduces a new diagnostic benchmark for directly evaluating commonsense reasoning in vision-language models, based on image-text retrieval. Other work relies more on downstream performance on VQA.

- Knowledge Source: This work uses ConceptNet as the source of commonsense knowledge. Other efforts have utilized different knowledge bases or external corpora.

- Performance Gains: The gains in commonsense reasoning ability shown in this work seem fairly significant based on the proposed evaluation. Other methods have shown smaller gains on existing benchmarks.

In summary, the data augmentation strategy with knowledge graphs and the reusable evaluation benchmark seem to be the unique contributions of this work compared to prior art for improving commonsense in vision-language models. The gains shown are promising but evaluation on a wider range of downstream tasks could further demonstrate effectiveness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to inject reasoning abilities, such as mathematical and physical reasoning, into vision-language models. The authors note that awareness of commonsense knowledge alone is not enough for human-like intelligence, and reasoning abilities are still lacking in current models. 

- Analyzing and improving other aspects of reasoning beyond commonsense in vision-language models, such as deductive, inductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning. The paper focuses on commonsense reasoning, but other types of reasoning are also important.

- Exploring ways to make vision-language models more aware of numbers, quantities, and mathematical relationships. As noted in the failure case analysis, current models still struggle with numerical reasoning and counting in real-world scenarios.

- Studying methods to help models dynamically utilize knowledge graphs and external knowledge sources when needed during inference. The DANCE method trains models to internalize commonsense knowledge, but more flexible utilization of knowledge may be beneficial.

- Developing new benchmark tasks and datasets to evaluate different facets of reasoning abilities in vision-language models beyond commonsense. The proposed diagnostic retrieval task focuses on commonsense evaluation, but tasks targeting other reasoning skills could be useful.

- Exploring whether pre-training objectives beyond contrastive learning can improve commonsense and reasoning abilities. The DANCE method augments contrastive pre-training, but other pre-training frameworks may also be effective.

In summary, extending the commonsense capabilities of vision-language models to more advanced reasoning and inference abilities seems to be a key future direction highlighted by this work. Both model architecture and training approaches need to be developed to achieve human-like versatile reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on analyzing and improving the commonsense ability of recent popular vision-language (VL) models. The authors observe that existing VL-models still lack commonsense knowledge and reasoning ability, such as not being able to identify a lemon when given the text "It tastes sour". They find that an important reason is that large-scale VL datasets like COCO and Conceptual Captions do not contain much commonsense knowledge, having more nouns/entities and fewer verbs compared to regular texts. To address this, they propose a data augmentation strategy called DANCE which generates commonsense-aware image-text training pairs by extracting entities from existing captions, querying related subgraphs from ConceptNet, and converting the graph edges to natural language. This allows injecting external knowledge into VL models without needing graph operations or external knowledge at inference time. They also propose a new retrieval-based diagnostic benchmark to evaluate commonsense ability. Experiments show DANCE significantly improves performance on their benchmark and the OK-VQA dataset compared to strong baselines like CLIP, demonstrating it is effective at improving commonsense capabilities. The key ideas are leveraging knowledge graphs to augment datasets with commonsense information, and using a retrieval benchmark to directly evaluate commonsense skills.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper focuses on analyzing and improving the commonsense ability of recent popular vision-language (VL) models. The authors observe that despite great success, existing VL-models still lack commonsense knowledge and reasoning ability. For example, models struggle to identify a lemon when given the text "It tastes sour." Through analysis, the authors find an important reason is that large-scale VL datasets like COCO and Conceptual Captions do not contain much commonsense knowledge compared to regular texts. This motivates them to improve the commonsense ability of VL-models from the data perspective. 

Rather than collecting a new dataset, the authors propose a more scalable data augmentation strategy called DANCE (Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph linearization for CommonsensE capability). It injects commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet into existing datasets on the fly during training. Specifically, it re-organizes ConceptNet into (entity, relation, entity) entries and pairs them with images containing those entities. It hides entity names with pronouns to create image-text pairs for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate DANCE significantly improves commonsense ability on the authors' proposed retrieval benchmark and VQA task while maintaining performance on vanilla retrieval. Overall, this work provides useful insights on analyzing and improving commonsense in VL-models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a novel data augmentation strategy called Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph linearization for CommonsensE capability (DANCE) to improve the commonsense ability of vision-language (VL) models. The key idea is to leverage existing commonsense knowledge graphs (e.g. ConceptNet) to generate new training data for VL models. Specifically, they extract entities from existing image-text pairs, query the knowledge graph to obtain related commonsense knowledge, and convert the subgraphs into natural language descriptions where entity names are hidden (e.g. "this item is used for..."). These automatically generated image-text pairs containing commonsense knowledge are then mixed into the training data of VL models like CLIP. To evaluate commonsense ability, the authors also propose a new diagnostic test set based on image-text retrieval. Experiments show that models trained with DANCE significantly outperform baselines on commonsense tasks while maintaining performance on standard VL tasks. The proposed data augmentation strategy is model-agnostic and scalable.
