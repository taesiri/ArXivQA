# [Dialect prejudice predicts AI decisions about people's character,   employability, and criminality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior AI research has focused on overt racism in language models, but social scientists argue that in the US, racism has become more "covert" after the civil rights movement - avoiding direct mention of race but still perpetuating racial inequities. 
- It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models through "dialect prejudice" - negative stereotypes triggered solely by features of a racialized dialect like African American English (AAE).

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a new method called "Matched Guise Probing" to probe covert stereotypes triggered by AAE features, without overt mention of race. Compare texts in AAE vs Standard American English (SAE).
- Analyze multiple language models - GPT2, RoBERTa, T5, GPT3.5, GPT4.

Main Contributions:
- First evidence of covert dialect prejudice in language models, through negative stereotypes about intelligence and criminality. Stereotypes are more negative than worst recorded human stereotypes about African Americans.  
- Observe discrepancy between overt positive and covert negative stereotypes about African Americans, especially in models with human feedback. Suggests models conceal racism.
- Prejudice impacts hypothetical decisions - models assign less prestigious jobs and harsher sentences to AAE speakers.  
- Increasing scale and adding human feedback training does NOT reduce covert racism. Can make discrepancy between overt and covert stereotypes worse.
- Relate language models' inconsistent racial attitudes to inconsistencies in contemporary US racial attitudes after the civil rights movement.

Key implications are that current methods to reduce racial bias in language models are ineffective for covert forms of racism manifesting through dialect. The allocational harms resulting from models' dialect prejudice in areas like employment and criminal justice risk amplifying discrimination against minorities like African Americans.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper demonstrates that language models exhibit covert racism against African Americans in the form of dialect prejudice, associating speakers of African American English with negative stereotypes similar to archaic human stereotypes from before the civil rights movement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents evidence that language models exhibit covert racism against African Americans in the form of "dialect prejudice" - negative stereotypes triggered by features of African American English (AAE). The key findings and contributions include:

1) Language models associate speakers of AAE with archaic, negative stereotypes about African Americans from before the civil rights movement. In fact, the stereotypes are even more negative than the worst human stereotypes ever experimentally recorded.

2) There is a discrepancy between the overtly positive stereotypes language models exhibit about African Americans when race is mentioned explicitly, versus the covertly negative stereotypes triggered just by features of AAE. This reflects inconsistent racial attitudes in contemporary American society.

3) Language models make more negative judgments about speakers of AAE in hypothetical hiring and legal decisions, allocating them less prestigious jobs and harsher criminal sentences. This demonstrates a real-world impact of dialect prejudice.  

4) Existing techniques like model scaling and human feedback training do not mitigate dialect prejudice. In fact, human feedback training just hides overt stereotypes while covert ones remain.

5) Through carefully designed experiments, the paper shows the stereotypes are directly caused by linguistic features of AAE, not just a general negativity toward non-standard dialects.

In sum, the paper uncovers and documents this previously unknown phenomenon of covert racism encoded in language models, with implications for the fair deployment of language technology.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Covert racism/prejudice
- Dialect prejudice
- African American English (AAE) 
- Matched Guise Probing
- Language models (e.g. GPT2, GPT3.5, RoBERTa)
- Stereotype analysis
- Employability analysis  
- Criminality analysis
- Scale analysis 
- Human feedback analysis
- Linguistic features of AAE
- Allocational harms

The paper examines covert racism and dialect prejudice related to African American English in major language models. It introduces a new method called Matched Guise Probing to analyze this, and conducts stereotype, employability, criminality, scale, and human feedback analyses. The key finding is that language models exhibit covert prejudice against AAE speakers, associating them with negative stereotypes and making harmful decisions about them. The paper also analyzes specific linguistic features of AAE that trigger these biases. Overall, it reveals new forms of covert harms caused by racial prejudice in language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel method called "Matched Guise Probing" to uncover covert racism in language models. Can you explain in detail how this method works and what insights it enables compared to prior work? 

2. The paper examines Matched Guise Probing in two settings - meaning-matched and non-meaning-matched. What is the motivation behind using these two settings and what are the relative advantages and disadvantages?

3. The paper computes association scores between tokens like adjectives or occupations and AAE/SAE. Can you walk through the mathematical formulation used to compute these scores in both the meaning-matched and non-meaning-matched settings? 

4. The paper argues that the computed association scores are "intrinsically calibrated". Explain what calibration means in this context and why it is an important property.

5. When comparing the stereotypes in language models to the human stereotypes from the Princeton Trilogy studies, the paper uses a variant of average precision that also accounts for the internal ranking of the adjectives. Justify why this was done instead of using regular average precision.

6. For the feature analysis, the paper specifically chooses 8 linguistic features of AAE to examine in isolation. Walk through the motivation behind choosing these particular features and what insights are gained.

7. When probing employability, the paper uncovers a negative correlation between occupational prestige and association with AAE. Propose some potential reasons that could lead language models to learn this correlation from the training data.

8. The criminality experiments simulate hypothetical trials and record decisions like convictions and death sentences. Discuss the limitations and ethical concerns around this setup. 

9. When analyzing model scale, the paper finds that larger models understand AAE better but are also more prejudiced. Propose an explanation for why this surprising effect occurs.

10. The discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes is argued to mirror inconsistent racial attitudes in contemporary US society. Substantiate this claim by relating it to concepts from the sociology literature.
