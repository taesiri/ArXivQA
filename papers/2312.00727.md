# [Safe Reinforcement Learning in Tensor Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00727)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for safe reinforcement learning (RL) that combines Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Tensor Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). The key insight is to represent the dynamics and value functions directly in terms of expected future observations, avoiding the need to estimate latent state distributions. Five important operators are introduced to capture the relationships between histories, actions, and future observations, allowing value and risk objectives to be optimized. By analyzing these operators, sample complexity bounds are established to ensure the RL algorithm converges to an Îµ-suboptimal safe policy with high probability. A key benefit of this approach is the ability to provide safety guarantees for partial observable environments with continuous state spaces, overcoming limitations of methods that rely on discretizing the state space. Through connections to the kernel Bayes' rule and model predictive control, the proposed representation also shows potential for capturing complex, nonlinear dynamics. Overall, this is an important step towards scalable and provably safe RL applicable to real-world control challenges.
