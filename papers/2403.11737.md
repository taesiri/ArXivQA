# [SMT-Based Dynamic Multi-Robot Task Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments where new tasks arrive online over time. Specifically, the focus is on point-to-point pickup and delivery tasks with deadlines, where the robots have limited capacity to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. The goal is to find valid plans to schedule and assign incoming tasks to the robot team so that all tasks are completed before their deadlines. 

The key challenges are:
(1) Dynamic arrival of tasks online
(2) Task deadlines that must be met
(3) Robot capacity constraints 
(4) Need for generalizable methods beyond specialized algorithms
(5) Requirement for soundness and completeness guarantees

Prior heuristic and optimization methods often lack completeness guarantees or ability to extend well to more complex task specifications. Methods with strong formal guarantees struggle to scale.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based approach to encode the MRTA problem constraints into logical formulas. An incremental SMT solving method is used, which leverages reuse of learned information when new tasks arrive to improve solve times. 

The encoding uses a graph to model robot travel time between locations and represents robot plans as sequences of pick, drop, move and wait actions. Capacity limits, deadlines and restrictions to ensure valid consistent plans are encoded. New tasks trigger addition of associated constraints. The number of action points per robot is dynamically adjusted to manage complexity.

An algorithm iteratively invokes the SMT solver after each new task set arrives, restricting the encoding to use the minimum number of necessary action points. If unsat, it incrementally scales up the action points until finding a satisfying plan or determining none exists.

Contributions:
(1) General SMT-based framework for dynamic MRTA leveraging incremental solving 
(2) Approach to dynamically fit problem size to needs by adjusting number of action points
(3) Theoretical results proving soundness and completeness
(4) Experimental evaluation on hospital-inspired application, analyzing performance vs. problem size and incremental vs non-incremental solving

The results demonstrate ability to handle problems of up to 20 robots and 200 tasks, highlighting potential to meet needs in complex real-world settings like healthcare robotics. The SMT encoding provides a strong formal basis to ensure plan validity.
