# [Response: Emergent analogical reasoning in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16118)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be whether large language models like GPT-3 have acquired an emergent ability to solve analogy problems in a zero-shot setting, without being explicitly trained to do so. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that the scale and training of large language models leads to an emergent capacity for analogical reasoning and general intelligence, even without being trained specifically on analogy tasks.

The authors test this by evaluating GPT-3's performance on letter string analogies and matrix reasoning problems. They compare its accuracy to human performance on standardized tests to assess whether its reasoning abilities approach human levels in a zero-shot setting.

In summary, the main research question is whether large language models like GPT-3 can display human-like analogical reasoning capacities in a zero-shot setting purely as an emergent phenomenon resulting from their scale and training methodology. The hypothesis is that they have acquired such capacities based on their training at scale on broad corpora.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 exhibit emergent analogical reasoning abilities in a zero-shot setting, without being specifically trained to solve analogy problems. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that the scale and training of large models like GPT-3 enables them to develop a general capacity for analogical reasoning, even though they are not explicitly trained or fine-tuned for such tasks. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that GPT-3 will be able to solve letter string analogy problems and matrix analogy problems in a zero-shot setting, demonstrating an emergent capacity for the core cognitive skill of analogical reasoning.

The paper tests this hypothesis by evaluating GPT-3's performance on letter string analogies (e.g. ab:ab::cd:cdj) and matrix analogies with numbers, without providing any training examples or cues. The goal is to assess whether GPT-3 can exhibit human-like analogical reasoning on these tasks in a zero-shot setting, as an emergent property resulting from its scale and training on language modeling objectives. The authors compare GPT-3's accuracy to human performance to evaluate its capabilities.

In summary, the central research question appears to be whether LLMs like GPT-3 can demonstrate emergent analogical reasoning abilities in a zero-shot setting, without being specifically trained for such tasks. The key hypothesis is that GPT-3 will successfully solve analogies, indicating the emergence of this important cognitive skill from its scale and self-supervised training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing evidence against the claim that large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have an emergent ability for zero-shot analogical reasoning, as argued in the recent Nature Human Behaviour paper by Webb et al. 

Specifically, the authors of this response paper:

- Show that GPT-3's performance on letter string analogies drops dramatically when using a synthetic alphabet instead of the normal English alphabet. This counters the claim that GPT-3 has a very general capacity for analogical reasoning.

- Demonstrate that even using the normal alphabet, GPT-3's performance decreases substantially if simple modifications are made to increase the interval size in the letter string sequences. This indicates the original high performance may rely on memorized training examples.

- Argue that the term "zero-shot" reasoning implies the model has not seen similar examples during training. But it is impossible to verify this without access to the full GPT-3 training data. The authors suggest novel problem sets are needed to better test for zero-shot reasoning capacity.

- Caution that similarity in performance trends between GPT-3 and humans does not necessarily imply GPT-3 is exhibiting human-like analogical reasoning abilities.

Overall, the paper challenges the notion put forth by Webb et al. that GPT-3 demonstrates a robust, general capacity for analogical reasoning. The authors argue more evidence is needed to support such an extraordinary claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is that it provides counterexamples that challenge the claim made in the original Nature Human Behaviour paper by Webb et al. that large language models like GPT-3 have an emergent ability for analogical reasoning in a zero-shot setting. 

Specifically, this response paper makes the following key points:

- The authors test GPT-3 on modified versions of the letter string analogy problems from the original paper, using a larger interval size between letters and a synthetic alphabet. 

- GPT-3's performance on these modified letter string analogies is significantly worse than on the original problems, dropping to near zero accuracy on some problem types.

- This poor performance on simple modifications to the problems and on a novel synthetic alphabet counters the claim made in the original paper of GPT-3's "very general capacity in zero-shot analogical reasoning."

- The high success of GPT-3 on the original letter string problems may be due to memorization of similar examples from its training data, rather than true reasoning ability.

- Stronger evidence is needed to support claims of human-like, zero-shot reasoning in large language models beyond performance on a narrow set of problems.

In summary, this response paper challenges the original claim of emergent analogical reasoning in GPT-3 by testing its robustness and generalizability, and finding the performance does not hold up. The authors argue more rigorous testing is needed to substantiate such extraordinary claims about AI reasoning abilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The authors present counter-examples showing that the large language model GPT-3 fails to demonstrate robust zero-shot analogical reasoning capabilities on simple modifications of letter string analogy problems, challenging claims made in a recent high-profile Nature paper.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The authors present results that counter the claim made in a recent Nature paper that large language models like GPT-3 exhibit a general capacity for zero-shot analogical reasoning; through experiments with modified letter string analogy problems and a synthetic alphabet, they find GPT-3 struggles even with simple variants, suggesting stronger evidence is needed regarding emergent reasoning abilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on analogical reasoning in AI systems:

- The focus on large language models like GPT-3 is relatively novel. Most prior work has looked at analogical reasoning in more specialized AI systems rather than large, general-purpose language models. So this represents an interesting new direction.

- The use of letter string analogies as a benchmark task is common in studies of analogical reasoning. However, the authors have generated a large set of novel letter string analogy problems rather than using existing standardized tests. 

- Evaluating performance in a zero-shot setting without providing examples is less common. Many studies provide the model with examples/training before testing. Evaluating true zero-shot transfer is more challenging.

- Comparing model performance to untrained humans provides an interesting benchmark, but human evaluation data is still fairly limited in this paper (based on a small sample).

- The finding that performance degrades with increasing problem complexity echoes results from some prior AI studies. However, other researchers have found that neural networks can sometimes excel precisely on more complex analogies.

- The interpretations about underlying mechanisms and parallels to human cognition are more speculative. Additional experiments would be needed to further test hypotheses about how the models solve these tasks.

Overall the zero-shot evaluation on a large dataset of letter string analogies makes a useful contribution. But the paper also raises many questions for future work to better understand the nature and limits of analogical reasoning in language models. More rigorous human comparison data and analysis of model representations/mechanisms would strengthen the conclusions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key things to consider when comparing this paper to other research on analogical reasoning in large language models:

- The focus on zero-shot performance is quite novel. Most prior work has looked at how models perform on analogies after some amount of fine-tuning or training on analogy datasets. This paper claims GPT-3 can solve new analogies it has never seen before, which is a stronger claim about its reasoning abilities. More evidence may be needed to fully support this claim.

- The use of letter string analogies is fairly common in this research area. However, the authors introduce some new variants like removing redundant letters that help systematically test different skills. The matrix analogy tasks are less commonly used for evaluating AI systems.

- Comparing model performance to untrained humans is useful context, but does not definitively prove human-like reasoning. The comparison shows similarities in pattern of performance, but additional experiments would be needed to confirm if GPT-3 is using human-like mechanisms versus pattern matching.

- The scale of GPT-3 allows testing on a wider range of analogies than prior work. But scale alone does not necessarily confer reasoning abilities. The results are intriguing but examining the robustness and limits of the abilities is important.

- The authors appropriately acknowledge limitations like potential training on related analogies and the simple nature of the tasks. More complex relational analogies like Raven's matrices remain challenging.

Overall, this paper provides useful evidence that large language models may develop some implicit capacity for analogical reasoning as scale increases. However, more work is needed to understand the scope, robustness, and origin of these abilities. The zero-shot claim needs more rigorous testing on truly novel tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Test GPT-3 and other LLMs on a wider range of analogy problems to better understand the scope and limits of their analogical reasoning abilities. The authors suggest exploring verbal, pictorial, and mathematical analogies beyond the letter string and matrix problems used in this study. 

- Conduct experiments to determine if GPT-3 is truly exhibiting zero-shot analogical reasoning or if its performance relies on memorization from its training data. The authors acknowledge the need for developing techniques to rule out memorization as an explanation.

- Compare GPT-3's performance and error patterns to human behavioral data on the same analogy tasks. The authors suggest collaborating with cognitive scientists to run experiments comparing LLMs to humans. 

- Explore whether the mechanisms underlying GPT-3's analogical reasoning abilities are similar to human cognition, as the authors hypothesize based on the similar performance patterns they observed. This could involve computational modeling and analysis of GPT-3's representations and processes.

- Test the impact of different prompt formulations on GPT-3's analogy performance to better understand how to elicit its analogical abilities. The authors suggest systematic prompt engineering studies.

- Examine how factors like model scale, training objectives, and architecture design choices impact the emergence of analogical reasoning in LLMs. This could shed light on how to develop LLMs with stronger reasoning abilities.

- Investigate how analogy relates to other facets of abstract reasoning and whether abilities like conceptual combination emerge in LLMs as consequences of scale and training as well.

So in summary, the authors call for expanded empirical tests, comparisons to human cognition, investigating the underlying mechanisms, and probing the role of model architecture and training. Advancing understanding in these areas could reveal more about the nature and limits of analogical reasoning in LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest a few future research directions:

- Conduct human behavioral experiments with the modified letter string analogy problems using a synthetic alphabet to compare human and AI performance. This could help determine if the modified problems are actually more difficult for humans as well.  

- Further investigate the role of training data in explaining GPT-3's performance on analogical reasoning tasks. The authors suggest developing approaches to test analogical reasoning that preclude simply memorizing examples from the training data. 

- Explore additional ways to generate novel analogy problem sets that are distinct from the training data to better test for true zero-shot reasoning capacity.

- Conduct further tests on other large language models besides GPT-3 to see if similar capabilities and limitations exist across different models. 

- Examine the mistakes made by models on analogy problems in more detail and compare to human errors to gain more insight into the reasoning processes.

- Consider alternative explanations besides zero-shot reasoning that could produce human-like performance declines as problem complexity increases.

Overall, the authors recommend more rigorous testing of analogical reasoning abilities in large language models to better determine if true zero-shot reasoning capacity exists versus reliance on training data. Comparing performance to humans remains important, but human-like results alone do not confirm the reasoning process.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a response to "Emergent analogical reasoning in large language models" by Webb et al. (2023). The authors test GPT-3's ability to solve letter string analogy problems using simple modifications such as changing the alphabet and increasing the interval size between letters. Their results show that GPT-3's performance drops dramatically on these modified problems, even failing on the easiest variants, which counters Webb et al.'s claim that GPT-3 exhibits a general zero-shot capacity for analogical reasoning. The authors argue that GPT-3's success on the original problems may be due to memorization from the training data rather than real analogical reasoning. They conclude that stronger evidence is needed to substantiate claims about emergent abilities in large language models, especially regarding zero-shot reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper responds to a recent Nature Human Behaviour study that claimed large language models like GPT-3 exhibit emergent analogical reasoning abilities in a zero-shot setting. The authors of this response paper tested variants of the letter string analogy problems from the original study, using modifications like a synthetic alphabet and increased interval sizes between letter transformations. They found that GPT-3's performance dropped dramatically on these modified analogy problems, even failing on simple extensions of the original letter string tasks. Based on these results, the authors conclude there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that GPT-3 has a general capacity for zero-shot analogical reasoning. They suggest stronger evidence is needed, like testing on analogies likely absent from the training data, before such extraordinary claims about emergent reasoning abilities can be made.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper responds to a recent Nature Human Behaviour study by Webb et al. that argued large language models like GPT-3 have an emergent ability for zero-shot analogical reasoning based on their performance on letter string analogy problems. The authors of this response paper disagree with that conclusion and aim to provide counterexamples where GPT-3 fails on simple variants of the analogy problems presented in Webb et al. 

The authors modified the original letter string analogy problems in two main ways: 1) increasing the interval size in the letter sequences from one to two letters, and 2) utilizing a synthetic alphabet instead of the English alphabet. They found that GPT-3's performance substantially decreased on the modified problems, especially with the synthetic alphabet where accuracy dropped close to zero on most problem types. The authors argue this provides evidence against GPT-3 having a general zero-shot reasoning capacity. They propose the high success in the original paper may be due to GPT-3 memorizing training examples rather than exhibiting true reasoning. The authors conclude that stronger evidence is needed to support claims of human-like analogical reasoning abilities in large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper responds to a recent Nature Human Behaviour study by Webb et al. which claimed that large language models like GPT-3 display emergent analogical reasoning abilities in a zero-shot setting. The authors of this response paper test variants of the letter string analogy problems from the original study and find that GPT-3's performance drops significantly on these modified problems as well as when using a synthetic alphabet. They argue that this counters the claim that GPT-3 has a very general capacity for zero-shot analogical reasoning. The authors suggest the high performance on the original letter string problems could be due to the training data rather than true reasoning ability. They call for stronger evidence and novel problem sets to support extraordinary claims about emergent abilities in large language models.

Paragraph 2: The authors modify the letter string problems in two main ways: increasing the interval size in the letter sequence and using a synthetic alphabet. On most problem types, GPT-3's accuracy drops drastically with these changes, to near zero on some. Performance only stays high on problems involving removing redundant letters or sorting. The authors argue this shows weaknesses in GPT-3's analogical reasoning as it fails on simple extensions of the original problems. They also cite the poor performance on the synthetic alphabet as evidence against zero-shot reasoning, since GPT-3 likely has not seen this alphabet before. The authors conclude there is insufficient evidence for the emergent analogical reasoning abilities claimed in the original paper. More rigorous testing and analysis is needed to substantiate such extraordinary claims about large language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The authors test the ability of the large language model GPT-3 to solve letter string analogy problems. They generate 50 instances each of 6 types of letter string analogies (extend sequence, remove redundant letter, successor, predecessor, fix alphabetic sequence, sort). To test for zero-shot reasoning, they modify the problems in 3 ways: 1) increasing the interval size from 1 letter to 2 letters, 2) adding a prompt with a synthetic alphabet, and 3) using the synthetic alphabet with the increased interval size. They compare GPT-3's accuracy on the original vs modified problems. The modifications drastically reduce accuracy, suggesting GPT-3 is not exhibiting true zero-shot reasoning but rather relying on memorization from the training data. They conclude that stronger evidence is needed to support the claim that GPT-3 has an emergent capacity for analogical reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper tests the analogical reasoning abilities of the large language model GPT-3 on letter string analogy problems. The authors created different types of letter string analogy problems, such as extending a sequence, identifying successors and predecessors, removing redundant letters, fixing alphabetic sequences, and sorting letters. To test GPT-3's ability for zero-shot analogical reasoning, the authors prompted GPT-3 with two rows containing letter strings and asked it to complete the pattern by generating the missing string in the second row. For each analogy type, 50 different instances were created and tested. The authors evaluated GPT-3's performance by calculating the accuracy of its generated responses across the different analogy types. The accuracy was measured as the percentage of correct responses out of 50 trials for each analogy type. This allowed the authors to compare GPT-3's analogical reasoning abilities across the different types of letter string analogies.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is responding to the recent Nature Human Behaviour paper by Webb et al. titled "Emergent analogical reasoning in large language models." The key question the response paper is addressing is whether the claims made by Webb et al. about the analogical reasoning abilities of large language models like GPT-3 are supported by strong evidence. 

Specifically, the authors of the response paper question Webb et al.'s conclusion that GPT-3 exhibits a "general capacity in zero-shot analogical reasoning." They test this claim by modifying and extending the letter string analogies used by Webb et al. to see if GPT-3 can still solve them. Their main finding is that GPT-3's performance substantially decreases on the modified letter string tasks, even simple extensions of the originals, which counters the claim about GPT-3's general zero-shot reasoning ability.

In summary, the key question the response paper is addressing is whether the evidence presented by Webb et al. actually supports their strong conclusions about emergent analogical reasoning abilities in large language models like GPT-3, especially the claim regarding zero-shot reasoning capacity. By testing modifications of the original letter string tasks, the authors of the response paper aim to provide counterevidence to that claim.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper states that GPT-3 exhibits human-like performance decreases as analogy problem complexity increases. However, couldn't this observation also be explained by a lack of complex analogy solutions in the training data rather than true emergent reasoning abilities? How could the authors further investigate the underlying mechanisms leading to this performance trend?

2. For the letter string analogies, what steps could be taken to more conclusively rule out the possibility that GPT-3 is relying on memorization from the training data rather than analogical reasoning abilities? Are there ways to generate novel letter string analogies that GPT-3 is unlikely to have seen during pre-training?

3. The authors mention evaluating performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices as an important future direction. What specific challenges or limitations might arise when adapting the current approach to matrix reasoning problems compared to letter string analogies? How could the prompting strategy and evaluation be designed to best assess reasoning abilities?

4. The prompting strategy provides critical guidance and structure to GPT-3. How sensitive are the results to changes in the exact prompt wording and formatting? What controls could be implemented during prompting to further isolate the model's own reasoning capacities? 

5. For the few analogy types where accuracy was near chance, what modifications to the prompting or analogy structure could potentially improve performance? Are there any insights into GPT-3's capabilities from both high and low accuracy analogy types?

6. The authors use accuracy on a test set to evaluate reasoning ability. What other metrics could also shed light on the underlying processes, such as confidence ratings, response time, or analysis of partial solutions?

7. What role might model scale play in analogical reasoning performance? Could smaller versions of GPT-3 also exhibit this emergent ability, or is a certain model capacity required? How could model scale be systematically analyzed?

8. The zero-shot setting is meant to demonstrate emergent reasoning without explicit training on analogies. However, how sensitive are the results to the exact parameters of the pre-training data? Could performance significantly change with different pre-training corpora?

9. The authors focus on GPT-3, but how do these results compare to other large language models? Replicating the analysis across multiple models could provide broader insight into reasoning abilities in LLMs. 

10. The paper analyzes performance at the dataset level. What insights could be gained from a more fine-grained analysis of which specific analogy examples are solved correctly versus incorrectly? How does error analysis align with hypotheses about the underlying reasoning process?
