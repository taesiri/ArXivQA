## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a family of sublayers called the Extractors to replace the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture. The paper introduces four types of Extractors:

- Super High-Performance Extractor (SHE): Significantly outperforms self-attention but requires more computations.

- Higher-Performance Extractor (HE): Outperforms multi-head self-attention with fewer computations. 

- Worthwhile Extractor (WE): Outperforms single-head self-attention with fewer computations.

- Minimalist Extractor (ME): Requires very few computations while maintaining performance close to single-head self-attention.

The key idea of the Extractors is to extract unified features from the input sequence as a constant-length representation that can be fed to a feedforward network. This avoids the quadratic complexity of self-attention. 

Experiments on text generation show the performance gains of using Extractors over standard self-attention Transformers. The paper also provides complexity analysis showing the tradeoffs between performance and computations for the different Extractor variants.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a family of drop-in replacements for self-attention that can improve Transformer performance and/or reduce complexity. The Extractors offer flexibility in trading off performance vs efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes replacing the self-attention mechanism in Transformers with a new module called an Extractor to improve performance, and shows experimentally that Extractors can outperform self-attention with comparable or lower complexity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on replacing the self-attention mechanism in Transformers:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing the "Extractor" modules as drop-in replacements for self-attention. The Extractors are flexible and allow trade-offs between performance and efficiency. Other works have proposed replacements like MLPs, convolutional blocks, Fourier transforms, etc. but the Extractors seem more customizable.

- Compared to efficient Transformers like Performers, Linformers, etc. that reduce self-attention complexity via low-rank approximations or sparsity, the Extractors take a different approach of extracting unified features. So it's a fairly novel technique.

- The paper shows strong performance gains with the "Super High-Performance Extractor" (SHE), outperforming standard self-attention. This is impressive compared to other replacement techniques like MLPs or convolutional layers which often underperform self-attention.

- However, the experiments are limited in scale due to computational constraints. It would be good to see these Extractors applied to larger models and datasets to better assess their capabilities.

- The computational complexity analysis shows the advantages of the Extractors, but actual runtimes/speedups were not measured. Comparing wall-clock training time would better showcase potential speed gains.

- Overall, the Extractors seem promising as a way to improve Transformer performance beyond self-attention. The different trade-offs they offer between complexity and performance is valuable. Testing them in larger-scale settings would better reveal their strengths and weaknesses compared to other self-attention replacements. But this paper introduces a novel approach with strong initial results.

In summary, the Extractors are a new way to enhance Transformers without self-attention, with flexibility on performance versus efficiency. More extensive testing is needed, but the initial design and results are compelling compared to prior work in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more variants of the proposed Extractor mechanism, especially ones that provide further performance improvements while balancing computational complexity. The authors propose the SHE, HE, WE, and ME as examples but suggest there could be many other variations worth exploring.

- Applying and evaluating the proposed Extractors on other sequence modeling tasks besides text generation, such as in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech processing. The authors state the Transformers with Extractors could be useful for these other domains as well.

- Further analyzing the theoretical properties of the Extractors, such as proving bounds on their computational complexity. The authors provide estimates of complexity but suggest more rigorous analysis could be done.

- Exploring hardware optimizations and implementations of the Extractors to take advantage of their shorter critical paths for computation. The authors suggest the Extractors may have potential to run faster than standard self-attention in practice.

- Developing pretraining techniques and methodologies tailored for the Extractors. The authors cite recent work on pretrained models but do not propose specific pretraining schemes for the Extractors.

- Applying the key ideas of the Extractors, such as their reverse order weighting scheme, to other sequence modeling architectures beyond the Transformer. The concepts could inform novel designs for RNNs, CNNs, etc.

- Drawing inspirations from the Markov chain formulation of sequence prediction to create new model designs and training strategies. The authors provide this formulation as context but do not extensively build on it.

In summary, the authors point to many opportunities for extending the Extractor mechanisms and applying their underlying concepts more broadly across sequence modeling architectures, tasks, and hardware platforms. There seem to be many interesting research directions left to explore based on this work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a family of drop-in replacements called Extractors to replace the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. The Extractors assign weights based on the reverse order of the input sequence. Four example Extractors are presented: the super high-performance Extractor (SHE), the higher-performance Extractor (HE), the worthwhile Extractor (WE), and the minimalist Extractor (ME). The SHE significantly outperforms self-attention but requires more computations. The HE and WE outperform multi-head and single-head self-attention respectively with fewer operations. The ME maintains close to single-head performance with far fewer operations.  

The paper also formulates sequence prediction for text generation as a variable-length Markov chain problem. Transformers are reviewed based on this understanding. Experiments in text generation show the Extractors match or exceed self-attention performance with equal or reduced complexity. The critical path for Extractors is shorter, allowing potential speedups. Overall, the Extractors provide effective drop-in replacements for self-attention to improve Transformer performance and efficiency.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a family of modules called Extractors to replace the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. The Extractors operate by first extracting unified features from the input sequence using operations like linear transformations or element-wise multiplication. These extracted features are then adjusted based on the sequence length using the latest vector in the input sequence. Finally, the adjusted extracted features are fed into a feedforward network to produce the output. Four example Extractor modules are introduced: the super high-performance Extractor (SHE), the higher-performance Extractor (HE), the worthwhile Extractor (WE), and the minimalist Extractor (ME). Experiments on text generation show that the SHE significantly outperforms standard self-attention, while the HE, WE, and ME achieve comparable or better performance than self-attention with reduced complexity. Overall, the Extractors provide effective and efficient alternatives to self-attention in Transformers.
