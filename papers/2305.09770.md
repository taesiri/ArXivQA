# [ConvXAI: Delivering Heterogeneous AI Explanations via Conversations to   Support Human-AI Scientific Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09770)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it does not seem to contain a specific research question or hypothesis. This appears to be a template LaTeX file for generating a manuscript, as indicated by the comments at the beginning. Some key points:- The file is named "sample-manuscript.tex" and is generated from a source file called "samples.dtx". - There are comments indicating this is a sample file that should be renamed and modified as needed. - It contains template LaTeX code for formatting a manuscript such as defining document class, bibliographic style, author names and affiliations, abstract, keywords, etc.- There are also some sample content like a dummy abstract, dummy author names, and placeholder text.- But there does not seem to be any actual manuscript content or details about a specific research project.So in summary, this sample template file itself does not have a research question or hypothesis, since it is just a starting point for creating a real manuscript documenting a research project. The user would fill in the actual details for their specific paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. It describes a new prototype system called ConvXAI that allows users to interact with AI explanations through natural language conversations. The system incorporates heterogeneous AI explanations (e.g. feature attributions, counterfactuals, similar examples, etc.) and allows users to ask various questions about a model's predictions/behavior through a chat interface.2. It identifies design principles for making conversational AI explanations more useful, based on formative studies and theories of human conversation. These principles include being multifaceted, mixed-initiative, enabling controllable explanations, and supporting context-aware drill-downs.3. It implements these principles into an interactive prototype for assisting with scientific writing tasks. The system provides sentence-level feedback on writing structure and style through two AI models. Users can then inquire about the feedback and improve their writing through conversational explanations with the XAI agent.4. It presents the results of two user studies evaluating ConvXAI compared to a baseline GUI system. The studies suggest ConvXAI helped users better understand system feedback, improve perceived writing abilities, and achieve better writing output based on automated metrics. The results provide insights into designing more useful conversational XAI systems.5. It makes available the core ConvXAI codebase and conversational XAI API to enable further research.In summary, the main novelty of this paper appears to be in proposing and evaluating a new conversational XAI prototype that embeds principles for making XAI systems more useful for real-world applications like writing assistance. The user studies provide evidence that conversational interactions can enhance XAI usability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my analysis, here is a brief comparison of this paper to other related research:- This paper presents a conversational AI system called ConvXAI to support scientific writing through heterogeneous AI explanations delivered via dialogue. Other related work has explored using conversational agents to explain AI systems, but focused more on evaluating explanation types rather than integrating them to meet user needs (e.g., Tsai et al. 2021, Sun et al. 2022). - A key contribution of this paper is identifying design principles for useful conversational XAI based on formative studies, including being multifaceted, controllable, mix-initiative, and enabling drill-downs. These principles differentiate ConvXAI from prior conversational XAI systems.- The paper evaluates ConvXAI in the context of AI-assisted scientific writing. Prior work has developed AI writing assistants, but not focused as much on explainability (e.g., Huang et al. 2018, Yuan et al. 2021). The interactive nature of ConvXAI is novel for writing support.- The evaluation involves comparative user studies with a baseline GUI-based XAI system. Findings indicate ConvXAI helps users understand system feedback and improve writing based on both user perception and text analysis. This demonstrates the value of conversational explanations.- The paper provides insights into practical usage patterns and ingredients for useful XAI systems. It also discusses limitations around system generalization and user backgrounds. Overall, it makes a significant contribution in applying Conversational XAI to real-world collaborative tasks.In summary, the key novelties of this paper compared to prior work are the design principles for conversational XAI, the application to AI-assisted writing, and insights from comparative user studies on the utility of conversational vs GUI explanations. The findings advance the understanding of useful explanations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review of the paper, here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Develop conversational AI systems that can provide explanations tailored to users with different backgrounds and expertise levels. The authors note that users with less AI expertise may need simpler, high-level explanations compared to experts who want more technical details. Providing tailored explanations based on the user's knowledge level is an area for future work.- Characterize the relationships and connections between different explanation methods. The authors observe that some explanations naturally lead into others (e.g. feature attributions before counterfactuals), suggesting there may be an underlying graph or structure to how explanations can be linked. Formalizing these relationships could improve conversational flows. - Incorporate more modalities beyond just natural language dialog. While conversational interaction is intuitive, combining it with traditional GUI controls like buttons and sliders could make systems easier to learn. Exploring multi-modal conversations is another direction.- Improve alignment between model predictions/explanations and human judgment. The authors find humans and models can still be misaligned even with XAI, indicating the importance of designing model objectives and outputs that match human expectations and needs. - Address the limitations of the current ConvXAI prototype, such as improving robustness of intent detection, expanding the types of explanations available, and conducting more comprehensive evaluations.In summary, the main future directions are providing tailored explanations for different users, formally characterizing the relationships between explanation types, supporting multi-modal conversation, and improving human-model alignment. Advancing these areas could lead to more useful conversational XAI systems.
