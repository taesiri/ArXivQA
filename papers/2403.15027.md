# [Grey-informed neural network for time-series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15027)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks require large amounts of data for training and lack interpretability as black-box models. This poses challenges for time series forecasting tasks with limited data. 

- Existing grey system models and neural networks have limitations when used individually for forecasting with small data samples.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Grey-Informed Neural Network (GINN) model that integrates a neural network with a grey system model. 

- The error function of GINN contains two components: the neural network error and the grey system model error. By minimizing both errors jointly, GINN overcomes the limitations of using either approach alone.

- GINN introduces grey system differential equations as prior knowledge to improve neural network interpretability and effectiveness with small samples.

- The paper also proposes a fractional-order GINN called FGINN using a novel fractional accumulation operator. This further enhances modeling capability.

Key Contributions:
- Novel GINN and FGINN models that synergistically combine strengths of neural networks and grey system models for small sample forecasting.

- New fractional accumulation and difference operators for the FGINN model.

- Theoretical analysis of model characteristics using fractional Gronwall inequality.

- Empirical evaluation on multiple real-world datasets demonstrating superiority of FGINN and GINN over existing methods in prediction accuracy.

- Framework for effectively selecting and integrating appropriate grey models with neural networks based on problem contexts.

In summary, the key insight is leveraging grey system knowledge to improve neural network forecasting performance and interpretability, with very promising results shown for small time series data.
