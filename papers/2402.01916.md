# [CoLe and LYS at BioASQ MESINESP8 Task: similarity based descriptor   assignment in Spanish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Addressed: 
The paper describes a system for automatically assigning descriptors from the DeCS (Descriptores en Ciencias de la Salud) vocabulary to Spanish biomedical abstracts, as part of the BioASQ biomedical semantic indexing challenge. The goal is to develop an automated method for labeling Spanish medical documents to facilitate organization and search.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose a similarity-based approach using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier backed by the Apache Lucene search engine. The abstracts from the training set are indexed in Lucene using several term extraction methods (stems, lemmas, noun phrases, dependencies). For a new abstract, Lucene retrieves the most similar abstracts from the index and a label ranking procedure assigns DeCS terms based on the labels of the neighbors, weighted by similarity score.

Additional Approaches:
The authors also experiment with:
- A "limited label powerset" method to create meta-labels by joining highly correlated DeCS term pairs
- Creating "label profiles" as synthetic documents representing the content associated with each DeCS label

Main Results: 
- Stemming-based representation achieved best results in preliminary experiments 
- Official runs competitive with top systems, confirming suitability of similarity-based methods
- General NLP tools worked reasonably well, but custom biomedical NLP could further improve performance

Key Contributions:  
- Comprehensive evaluation of multiple term extraction approaches with a similarity-based DeCS labeling system
- Demonstration that conventional IR methods can deliver good performance for biomedical semantic indexing in Spanish
- Analysis of label powerset and profile-based enhancements for improving multi-label classification

The paper provides useful insights on designing effective similarity-based systems for large-scale multi-label classification problems in the biomedical domain.
