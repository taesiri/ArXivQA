# [Building Cooperative Embodied Agents Modularly with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02485)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can Large Language Models (LLMs) help build cooperative embodied agents that can collaborate with other agents and humans to accomplish complex tasks through collaborative planning and communication?

The key hypothesis appears to be that recent LLMs, such as GPT-4, have the reasoning capacity and language skills to enable embodied agents to plan, communicate, and cooperate effectively with minimal training. 

The authors aim to investigate whether LLMs have the necessary abilities for embodied multi-agent cooperation, including extracting information from observations, revising beliefs about the world and other agents, deciding when and what to communicate, and collaboratively planning to achieve shared goals. 

To test this hypothesis, the authors propose a novel framework that utilizes LLMs to build cooperative agents and evaluate it in multi-agent embodied environments like Communicative Watch-And-Help and ThreeDWorld Multi-Agent Transport.

The central research thrust seems to be demonstrating that, with their framework, LLMs can surpass planning-based methods and exhibit emergent communication and cooperation skills without requiring fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. The authors also examine whether LLM agents can gain human trust and cooperate effectively.

In summary, the key research question is whether LLMs can enable embodied AI agents to successfully cooperate and communicate with minimal training, which the proposed framework aims to investigate through experiments in multi-agent cooperation tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-agent cooperation in embodied AI:

- Scope: This paper provides the first systematic study focused specifically on investigating LLMs' capabilities for planning, communication, and cooperation in embodied multi-agent settings.

The framework uniquely incorporates LLMs as core components for communication and reasoning/planning, unlike prior approaches that use LLMs mainly for single-agent planning. The belief module for tracking world state is also a novel contribution.

- Findings: Through experiments in two embodied cooperation environments, the authors demonstrate that LLMs can surpass traditional planning methods for multi-agent cooperation, without any fine-tuning of the models. The emergence of natural communication and effective coordination between LLM agents is a key insight.

- Human studies: The authors conducted human experiments showing LLM agents can cooperate well with humans through natural language communication, earning more trust compared to rule/planning based agents. Investigating human-AI cooperation is novel in this space.

- Analysis: The paper provides useful ablation studies and failure analysis illuminating the benefits and limitations of utilizing LLMs for embodied multi-agent cooperation, highlighting areas for future work.

Overall, this paper significantly advances the understanding of LLMs' potential for multi-agent embodied AI. The proposed framework and findings set a strong foundation for future research to build on for developing capable cooperative embodied agents with LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing embodied LLMs that can directly process multi-modal inputs like visual observations and spatial information. The current LLMs still struggle to effectively leverage things like images and 3D spatial relationships. Building embodied LLMs that can handle these modalities is key.

- Enabling LLMs to reason about and directly execute low-level actions, rather than only high-level plans. This could produce more realistic and nuanced cooperative behaviors between agents. 

- Improving the instruction following, common sense reasoning, and consistency of LLMs. Failures were still seen where the LLMs misunderstood instructions or made logical errors. More robust reasoning is needed.

- Exploring other training techniques like meta-learning or reinforcement learning to further improve cooperative skills versus just prompting. More advanced training may help agents learn to communicate and cooperate even more effectively.

- Testing the limits of emergent communication between LLM agents and developing more sophisticated communication conventions. There is still room to improve natural language communication.

- Expanding the capabilities to more complex environments and tasks to continue pushing multi-agent cooperation research forward.

In summary, the key future directions focus on improving the multi-modality, reasoning ability, training procedures, communication conventions, and task complexity that cooperative embodied LLMs can handle. Advancing each of these areas can build towards even more capable AI teammates.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a novel framework for utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to build cooperative embodied agents that can plan, communicate, and collaborate with other agents and humans to efficiently accomplish long-horizon tasks. The framework consists of five key modules - an Observation Module to process raw observations, a Belief Module to track the agent's understanding of the environment/other agents, a Communication Module that leverages the dialogue capabilities of LLMs to decide what to communicate, a Reasoning Module that uses LLMs to synthesize all information and decide high-level plans like when to communicate, and a Planning Module to execute low-level actions. The Communication and Reasoning Modules directly prompt the LLM with contextual information to generate natural language messages and high-level plans. This framework is evaluated on two multi-agent cooperation tasks and is shown to enable emergent communication and reasoning for cooperation, outperforming planning baselines. User studies also show LLM agents can earn more trust from and cooperate better with humans.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is whether large language models (LLMs) can help build cooperative embodied agents that can collaborate with other agents and humans to accomplish complex tasks through collaborative planning and communication. 

Specifically, the authors aim to investigate if LLMs have the necessary abilities for embodied multi-agent cooperation, including planning, communication, revising beliefs, and collaborating towards common goals. This is an important open question because while LLMs have shown promise for planning in single agent settings, their capacity for multi-agent cooperation with communication remains unclear. The ability to cooperate and communicate effectively is crucial for intelligent embodied agents that need to work with others.

To study this question, the authors propose a novel framework that utilizes LLMs to plan, communicate, and cooperate with other agents in embodied environments. They test this framework in two multi-agent cooperation tasks and conduct experiments collaborating with AI agents and humans.

In summary, the key problem is assessing whether LLMs can enable embodied agents to cooperate and communicate effectively to accomplish collaborative long-horizon tasks, which requires complex planning, belief revision, deciding when/what to communicate, and coordinating actions. This paper presents a systematic study investigating LLMs' capabilities on this important open question through their proposed framework and experiments.
