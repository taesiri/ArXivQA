# Building Cooperative Embodied Agents Modularly with Large Language   Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can Large Language Models (LLMs) help build cooperative embodied agents that can collaborate with other agents and humans to accomplish complex tasks through collaborative planning and communication?The key hypothesis appears to be that recent LLMs, such as GPT-4, have the reasoning capacity and language skills to enable embodied agents to plan, communicate, and cooperate effectively with minimal training. The authors aim to investigate whether LLMs have the necessary abilities for embodied multi-agent cooperation, including extracting information from observations, revising beliefs about the world and other agents, deciding when and what to communicate, and collaboratively planning to achieve shared goals. To test this hypothesis, the authors propose a novel framework that utilizes LLMs to build cooperative agents and evaluate it in multi-agent embodied environments like Communicative Watch-And-Help and ThreeDWorld Multi-Agent Transport.The central research thrust seems to be demonstrating that, with their framework, LLMs can surpass planning-based methods and exhibit emergent communication and cooperation skills without requiring fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. The authors also examine whether LLM agents can gain human trust and cooperate effectively.In summary, the key research question is whether LLMs can enable embodied AI agents to successfully cooperate and communicate with minimal training, which the proposed framework aims to investigate through experiments in multi-agent cooperation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract and skimming the paper, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:- The authors introduce a novel framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to build cooperative embodied agents that can plan, communicate, and collaborate with other agents and humans to accomplish long-horizon tasks efficiently. - They demonstrate through experiments on two embodied multi-agent cooperation environments (Communicative Watch-And-Help and ThreeDWorld Multi-Agent Transport) that their framework enables LLM-based agents to surpass strong planning-based baselines and exhibit emergent effective communication without requiring fine-tuning or few-shot prompting.- Through user studies, they show that LLM-based agents communicating in natural language can earn more trust from and cooperate more effectively with humans compared to non-LLM agents.In summary, the key contribution is a new framework leveraging the power of LLMs like GPT-4 to create cooperative embodied agents with planning, communication, and collaboration abilities that can cooperate well with other agents and humans in complex environments, demonstrated through experiments and user studies. The work underscores the potential of LLMs for embodied AI and multi-agent cooperation.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-agent cooperation in embodied AI:- Scope: This paper provides the first systematic study focused specifically on investigating LLMs' capabilities for planning, communication, and cooperation in embodied multi-agent settings. Much prior work has explored LLMs for planning in single-agent embodied tasks, but their potential for multi-agent cooperation remained relatively unexplored. - Methods: The paper introduces a novel modular framework for leveraging LLMs to power cooperative embodied agents. The framework uniquely incorporates LLMs as core components for communication and reasoning/planning, unlike prior approaches that use LLMs mainly for single-agent planning. The belief module for tracking world state is also a novel contribution.- Findings: Through experiments in two embodied cooperation environments, the authors demonstrate that LLMs can surpass traditional planning methods for multi-agent cooperation, without any fine-tuning of the models. The emergence of natural communication and effective coordination between LLM agents is a key insight.- Human studies: The authors conducted human experiments showing LLM agents can cooperate well with humans through natural language communication, earning more trust compared to rule/planning based agents. Investigating human-AI cooperation is novel in this space.- Analysis: The paper provides useful ablation studies and failure analysis illuminating the benefits and limitations of utilizing LLMs for embodied multi-agent cooperation, highlighting areas for future work.Overall, this paper significantly advances the understanding of LLMs' potential for multi-agent embodied AI. The proposed framework and findings set a strong foundation for future research to build on for developing capable cooperative embodied agents with LLMs.
