# Interacting with Non-Cooperative User: A New Paradigm for Proactive   Dialogue Policy

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an interactive proactive dialogue agent that can effectively lead conversations to a given goal while also maintaining high user satisfaction? Specifically, the paper proposes a new approach called "I-Pro" that aims to balance two key objectives in proactive dialogue systems:1) Quickly reaching the goal topic: The agent should aim to efficiently guide the conversation towards the target goal topic.2) Maintaining high user satisfaction: The agent should avoid dissatisfying the user which may cause them to disengage or behave non-cooperatively. The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling and balancing these two objectives will result in an agent that can more effectively and naturally conduct goal-driven dialogues.The I-Pro model incorporates a learned "goal weight" to achieve the tradeoff between the two objectives. This goal weight is derived from factors related to progress towards the goal topic and estimated user satisfaction. The paper presents experiments using simulated users to demonstrate that I-Pro can significantly outperform baseline methods on both goal completion rate and user satisfaction metrics.In summary, the core hypothesis is that simultaneously optimizing for goal-driven behavior and user satisfaction in an interactive setting will enable more effective proactive dialogue agents. The I-Pro model provides a new learning paradigm to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors take the first step to study proactive dialogue policy in an interactive setting, where they pay attention to dealing with non-cooperative user behavior. This is a more natural but challenging setting compared to prior work that uses static corpora.2. They propose a new model called I-Pro that can learn proactive policies interactively. I-Pro employs a learned goal weight to trade off between two objectives - reaching the goal topic quickly and maintaining high user satisfaction. The goal weight consists of four factors related to the dialogue context.3. The authors design user simulators with different tolerance levels to interact with I-Pro during training and evaluation. Experiments show I-Pro significantly outperforms baseline methods on both goal completion rate and user satisfaction.4. Analysis provides insights on how I-Pro adapts its policy based on different user tolerance levels and the correlations between the goal weight factors and the agent's choices.5. The interactive learning paradigm, baseline model, analysis and insights lay groundwork to advance research on more realistic and challenging proactive dialogue settings.In summary, the key contribution is the new interactive learning paradigm for proactive dialogue policies, along with the proposed I-Pro model that can trade off between different objectives through a learned goal weight. The experiments, analysis and insights move forward research in this direction.
