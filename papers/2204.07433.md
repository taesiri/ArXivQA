# [Interacting with Non-Cooperative User: A New Paradigm for Proactive   Dialogue Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07433)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop an interactive proactive dialogue agent that can effectively lead conversations to a given goal while also maintaining high user satisfaction? 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new approach called "I-Pro" that aims to balance two key objectives in proactive dialogue systems:

1) Quickly reaching the goal topic: The agent should aim to efficiently guide the conversation towards the target goal topic.

2) Maintaining high user satisfaction: The agent should avoid dissatisfying the user which may cause them to disengage or behave non-cooperatively. 

The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling and balancing these two objectives will result in an agent that can more effectively and naturally conduct goal-driven dialogues.

The I-Pro model incorporates a learned "goal weight" to achieve the tradeoff between the two objectives. This goal weight is derived from factors related to progress towards the goal topic and estimated user satisfaction. The paper presents experiments using simulated users to demonstrate that I-Pro can significantly outperform baseline methods on both goal completion rate and user satisfaction metrics.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that simultaneously optimizing for goal-driven behavior and user satisfaction in an interactive setting will enable more effective proactive dialogue agents. The I-Pro model provides a new learning paradigm to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors take the first step to study proactive dialogue policy in an interactive setting, where they pay attention to dealing with non-cooperative user behavior. This is a more natural but challenging setting compared to prior work that uses static corpora.

2. They propose a new model called I-Pro that can learn proactive policies interactively. I-Pro employs a learned goal weight to trade off between two objectives - reaching the goal topic quickly and maintaining high user satisfaction. The goal weight consists of four factors related to the dialogue context.

3. The authors design user simulators with different tolerance levels to interact with I-Pro during training and evaluation. Experiments show I-Pro significantly outperforms baseline methods on both goal completion rate and user satisfaction.

4. Analysis provides insights on how I-Pro adapts its policy based on different user tolerance levels and the correlations between the goal weight factors and the agent's choices.

5. The interactive learning paradigm, baseline model, analysis and insights lay groundwork to advance research on more realistic and challenging proactive dialogue settings.

In summary, the key contribution is the new interactive learning paradigm for proactive dialogue policies, along with the proposed I-Pro model that can trade off between different objectives through a learned goal weight. The experiments, analysis and insights move forward research in this direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new model called I-ProS that can learn proactive dialogue strategies through interacting with simulated users, with a focus on handling non-cooperative user behavior by balancing the goals of reaching a target topic quickly and maintaining high user satisfaction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in the field of proactive dialogue systems:

- Most prior work has focused on learning proactive dialogue policies from static corpora in a supervised manner. This paper proposes a more realistic interactive setting, where the agent dynamically interacts with user simulators during training.

- The paper highlights the issue of non-cooperative user behavior, which occurs when users are unsatisfied and change the topic. This is an important issue that has not received much attention before in proactive dialogue research. 

- The proposed model I-Pro learns to balance two goals: quickly reaching the target topic while also maintaining high user satisfaction. Most prior work focuses on only one of these goals. The learned goal weighting approach is novel.

- The paper provides an empirical comparison to several baseline methods like Pop (GCR) and Pop (US) which optimize only one goal. The results show I-Pro significantly outperforms these baselines on both goals.

- Analysis explores how different user simulator parameters like tolerance affect the learned policy. Additional ablation studies provide insight into how different factors influence the goal weighting. This kind of analysis is generally missing from prior work.

Overall, the interactive setting, handling of non-cooperative users, multi-goal optimization, and detailed empirical analysis help advance the state-of-the-art in proactive dialogue research. The work provides a strong baseline for future efforts in this emerging field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring more diverse user behavior and richer user personalities in the interactive proactive dialogue policy learning setting. The current work focuses on a simple user simulation model, so expanding this could lead to more realistic and complex interactions.

- Enhancing the goal weight module by considering more influencing factors beyond the current four (dialogue turn, goal completion difficulty, user satisfaction, and cooperative degree). Additional factors related to user state, dialogue context, etc. could help improve the goal weighting.

- Deploying the proposed model I-Pro to interact with real users in online applications. This could provide more insights and enable further improvements to the model based on real human interactions. 

- Developing more complex and realistic interactive settings for proactive dialogue beyond the current simplified topic-level abstraction. For example, incorporating more natural language aspects.

- Using the current work as a preliminary baseline for further research to advance interactive proactive dialogue agents, since this is still an underexplored area.

- Extending the approach to other potential applications of proactive dialogue like persuasion, negotiation etc.

In summary, the authors point towards more complex user modeling, enhanced goal weighting, real user deployment, more natural language grounding, and applications to other proactive scenarios as interesting directions for future work based on their initial contributions. Their work helps establish an initial framework and baseline in this emerging research area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new interactive learning paradigm for proactive dialogue systems, called I-Pro. Current solutions follow a static corpus-based learning approach which limits their practical application. This work aims to advance proactive dialogue policy research by having the agent dynamically interact with users. It focuses on coping with non-cooperative user behavior, where the user introduces off-path preferred topics when dissatisfied. The paper argues there are two key targets - quickly reaching the goal topic and maintaining high user satisfaction. These targets do not always converge, so the proposed I-Pro model employs a learned goal weight to trade off between them. The goal weight incorporates factors like dialogue turn, goal difficulty, satisfaction, and cooperation. Experiments with simulated users demonstrate I-Pro significantly outperforms baselines in effectively balancing the two targets. Analysis provides insights on how different factors impact the goal weight and policy learning. Overall, this grounded work establishes a strong interactive learning baseline to benefit future proactive dialogue research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new interactive learning framework for proactive dialogue systems called I-Pro. The key innovation is using a learned goal weight to achieve a trade-off between two objectives: quickly leading the conversation to a target goal topic, and maintaining high user satisfaction. The paper argues that in realistic conversations, these two goals can conflict since the topics that most satisfy the user may not be on the shortest path to the goal topic. To handle this trade-off, the I-Pro model learns a goal weight based on four factors: dialogue turn, goal completion difficulty, estimated user satisfaction, and cooperative degree. These factors allow the model to dynamically shift priority between user satisfaction and goal completion depending on the context. The model is trained using reinforcement learning, with the reward function incorporating both how quickly the goal is reached and the user's estimated satisfaction. Experiments with simulated users demonstrate that I-Pro significantly outperforms existing proactive dialogue systems on both goal completion rate and user satisfaction. The analysis also provides insights into how the goal weight correlates with different factors.

In summary, this paper makes two key contributions: (1) formalizing the trade-off between goal completion and user satisfaction for interactive proactive dialogues, and (2) proposing the I-Pro model to handle this trade-off via a learned goal weight incorporating multiple factors. The results demonstrate improved performance over prior methods and provide explanatory insights into the model's adaptive behavior.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes a new model named I-Pro for learning proactive dialogue strategies through interaction with user simulators. I-Pro employs a learned goal weight to achieve a trade-off between two objectives - reaching the target goal topic quickly and maintaining high user satisfaction. The goal weight is derived from four key factors: dialogue turn, estimated difficulty of reaching the goal, estimated user satisfaction, and degree of user cooperativeness. These factors are used to calculate a weighted score for each candidate topic at each turn, combining the estimated closeness to the goal topic and estimated user preference. The topic with the highest weighted score is selected to maximize the reward of faster goal arrival and higher user satisfaction. I-Pro is trained using deep Q-learning to optimize the policy and goal weight parameters. The effectiveness of balancing the two objectives is demonstrated through experiments with different user simulator settings.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of learning proactive dialogue policies in an interactive setting. Specifically, it focuses on two key issues:

1. Coping with non-cooperative user behavior. The paper argues that in realistic conversations, users may behave non-cooperatively by introducing off-topic or off-goal preferences when they are unsatisfied. This makes it challenging for the dialogue agent to lead the conversation towards a predefined goal.

2. Balancing two targets: reaching the goal topic quickly and maintaining high user satisfaction. The paper argues these two targets do not always converge, as topics preferred by the user may differ from topics that are closer to the goal. So the agent needs to balance between satisfying the user to avoid non-cooperative behavior, and leading the conversation efficiently towards the goal.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new proactive dialogue model called "I-Pro" that can learn interactive policies to achieve the desired balance between the two targets. The key ideas include:

- Learning a goal weight to trade off between choosing preferred vs goal-oriented topics. The weight is based on factors like dialogue turn, goal difficulty, user satisfaction, etc.

- Using user simulators with different "tolerance" levels to interactively train the model. This allows handling varying levels of non-cooperative behavior.

- Showing the model can outperform baselines in balancing goal achievement and user satisfaction on the simulated users.

In summary, the key problem is learning more robust proactive dialogue policies that can handle non-cooperative users and balance different objectives, in an interactive setting. The I-Pro model aims to address this through goal weighting and user simulation.
