# [Can Large Language Models Serve as Rational Players in Game Theory? A   Systematic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05488)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Game theory is frequently used to analyze human behavior in social science research. With the high alignment between LLMs and humans, using LLMs as substitutes for humans in game experiments is a promising direction. However, the capability boundaries of LLMs in game theory remain unclear.

Proposed Solution: 
- Systematically analyze LLMs in game theory using the metric of "rationality" - the fundamental principle for evaluating player behavior. Rationality means: (1) building clear desires, (2) refining beliefs about uncertainty, (3) taking optimal actions based on desires and beliefs.

- Select 3 classic games to evaluate LLMs on the above aspects of rationality:
    (1) Dictator game - evaluates desire building
    (2) Rock-Paper-Scissors - evaluates belief refining 
    (3) Ring-network game - evaluates taking optimal actions

Key Findings:
- LLMs can build basic desires, but struggle with uncommon preferences due to decreased math ability and inability to understand preferences
- LLMs cannot refine beliefs from many simple patterns, making them unsuitable for games requiring complex belief refining. However, GPT-4 shows human-like improving confidence in some patterns.  
- LLMs cannot autonomously follow ideal game process. Decomposing the process helps but phenomena of overlooking/modifying refined beliefs remain.  

Main Contributions:
- First systematic analysis of LLMs in game theory, evaluating rationality from 3 key perspectives
- Clarifies capability boundaries of current LLMs in game theory through experiments on classic games
- Provides guidance (e.g. decomposing game process, avoiding complex belief refining) for using LLMs as substitutes in social science research

The analysis gives a clearer picture of the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in game theory, cautioning against widespread use in social science without an understanding of their limitations. More powerful future LLMs may overcome some of these deficiencies.
