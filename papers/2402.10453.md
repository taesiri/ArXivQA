# [Steering Conversational Large Language Models for Long Emotional Support   Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Emotional support conversational systems need to be able to consistently follow expert strategies over long conversations. However, current evaluation methods focus more on response quality rather than strategy adherence. 
- Large language models (LLMs) tend to drift towards generic responses and lose focus on the prompted strategy as conversations get longer.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new metric called "Strategy Relevant Attention (SRA)" to quantify how much attention the LLM pays to strategy-related tokens when generating responses.
- Design prompt templates that position strategy tokens towards the end to increase SRA, enhancing strategy adherence. 
- Validate SRA by showing high correlation between SRA and human judgments of strategy following capability.
- Release an expanded emotional support conversations dataset with multiple strategy continuations.

Main Contributions:
- SRA metric to optimize prompts and evaluate strategy adherence in a model-agnostic way.
- Demonstrating prompt design techniques using SRA that improve strategy following in LLMs over long conversations.  
- Validating SRA against human judgments and strategy predictability from responses.
- Expanded emotional support conversations dataset for further research.

The key insight is that SRA allows systematically developing better prompts to control LLMs, rather than just evaluating final response quality. By keeping LLMs focused on the strategy, the overall conversation direction can be more consistent.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces a novel metric called Strategy Relevant Attention (SRA) to quantify how well large language models adhere to emotional support strategies in conversations, and shows SRA can guide the design of prompts to improve strategy adherence over prolonged dialogues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing the Strategy Relevant Attention (SRA) metric, a novel, model-agnostic approach designed to quantify a model's adherence to emotional support strategies in conversational AI systems. SRA measures the attention a model pays to strategy-related tokens. The paper shows SRA significantly correlates with a model's ability to sustain a strategy over long conversations.

2. Releasing an expanded dataset based on ESConv with multiple strategy continuations to serve as a resource for further research into emotionally intelligent conversational agents.

3. Demonstrating that the position of strategy tokens in prompts significantly influences the attention models pay to those tokens, with less conversation history in prompts and strategies placed at the end of the system message yielding higher SRA.

4. Uncovering through SRA analysis that models tend to lose strategic focus over long conversations when using naive/standard prompts, highlighting the need for optimized prompts.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing SRA to quantify and optimize strategy adherence, along with an expanded dataset and analyses showing how prompt structure impacts strategic consistency in long conversations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Emotional support conversations
- Large language models (LLMs) 
- Strategy adherence
- Strategy-Relevant Attention (SRA) metric
- Prompt engineering
- Conversation depth
- Strategy predictability
- Human evaluation
- Extended ESConv dataset

To summarize, this paper introduces a new metric called "Strategy-Relevant Attention" (SRA) to evaluate how well large language models can adhere to specified emotional support strategies in prolonged conversations. The key ideas involve using SRA to guide the development of better prompts, showing SRA decreases in basic prompts as conversations continue, and demonstrating SRA correlates with human judgments of strategy following ability. The paper also releases an extended dataset based on the ESConv dialogues. The main goals are improving strategy consistency in assistive dialog agents and quantifying this capability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new metric called Strategy Relevant Attention (SRA). What is the intuition behind using attention to strategy tokens as a measure of a model's ability to adhere to a specified strategy? How is SRA formally defined?

2. The paper finds that standard prompts lead to deteriorating strategy adherence over the course of long conversations. What evidence supports this finding? How do different prompt structures impact the SRA over the length of a conversation?

3. The authors designed several variants of prompts by changing the position of strategy guidelines and number of turns in the assistant/user section. What was the rationale behind testing these different prompt structures? Which one showed the highest SRA?

4. The paper proposes two methods for automatically evaluating strategy adherence - SRA and predictability of the strategy from the response. How do these methods correlate? What are the relative advantages of each approach? 

5. The human evaluation results show a high correlation between SRA difference and human judgement of strategy following. What does this suggest about the usefulness of SRA? How was the human evaluation performed?

6. How consistent is the effectiveness of SRA across the different emotional support strategies explored in the paper? Is there evidence that it generalizes well?

7. What qualitative analysis was done to assess whether high SRA responses use words relevant to the strategy? What can you conclude from this analysis?

8. The authors use LLaMA models in their experiments. How does quantization of these models help facilitate experiments? Would the findings generalize to other transformer models?  

9. What are some limitations of using SRA to evaluate strategy adherence? In what ways could the research be extended or improved in future work?

10. The paper introduces an expanded emotional support conversation dataset. How was this dataset created? What value does it add over existing resources?
