# [TaxDiff: Taxonomic-Guided Diffusion Model for Protein Sequence   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17156)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Designing protein sequences with desired biological functions and structural stability is important for applications like enzyme engineering, vaccine design, etc. Existing generative models for protein design lack controllable generation capabilities and can only randomly generate sequences without considering taxonomic information. This limits their practical usefulness.  

Proposed Solution - TaxDiff:
The paper proposes TaxDiff, a taxonomic-guided diffusion model for controllable protein sequence generation. Key aspects:

- Combines species/taxonomic information with generative capabilities of diffusion models to generate structurally stable and functional proteins within sequence space of desired taxonomic groups. 

- Inserts taxonomic control features into each layer of transformer blocks to enable fine-grained control.

- Employs combination of global and local attention to ensure sequence consistency and structural foldability of taxonomic-specific proteins.

- Reclassifies protein sequences at family and species levels to consolidate overly detailed taxonomic categories in UniProt database.

- Follows sequence-first protein design paradigm like EvoDiff, capable of generating both sequences and structures.

Main Contributions:

- First taxonomy-guided controllable protein sequence generation model. Provides a framework to guide diffusion models using taxonomic signals.

- Proposes patchify attention mechanism for better sequence-level protein generation by capturing both global and local features.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both taxonomic-guided controllable and unconditional generation benchmarks. Generated sequences have high structural confidence scores, consistency and stability.

- Significantly faster than other diffusion models, generating 1000 sequences in just 24 minutes. 

- Versatile framework that can be expanded for various protein generation applications requiring fine-grained control.

In summary, TaxDiff advances controllable and efficient protein sequence generation to better meet needs of downstream biology tasks.
