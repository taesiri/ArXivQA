# [Auditing and Generating Synthetic Data with Controllable Trust   Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10819)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we holistically audit the trustworthiness of synthetic datasets generated by AI models across various modalities (tabular, timeseries, text), and ensure they conform to requirements around bias/fairness, privacy, fidelity, utility, and robustness?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a framework to audit synthetic datasets in a holistic way across multiple "trust dimensions" like fairness, privacy, utility etc. 

- The framework evaluates quantitative metrics for each trust dimension, aggregates them into trust dimension indices, and combines these indices into an overall "trust index" that ranks synthetic datasets.

- The framework handles different data modalities like tabular, timeseries, and text data.

- It aims to ensure synthetic data conforms to important socio-technical requirements around fairness, privacy, utility etc. as data generation moves more into AI models.

- The trust index allows controllable tradeoffs between trust dimensions based on their importance for a particular application.

- They also propose "TrustFormer" models that incorporate trust constraints and use the trust index for model selection during training.

So in summary, the key research contribution is a holistic auditing methodology and framework to ensure synthetic datasets meet important trustworthiness criteria around bias, fairness, privacy etc. in an interpretable and quantifiable way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a holistic framework for auditing the trustworthiness of synthetic datasets generated by AI models. The key contributions are:

1. A comprehensive set of metrics to assess synthetic data across multiple trust dimensions: fidelity, privacy, utility, fairness, and robustness. The metrics evaluate how closely the synthetic data matches the real data distribution, protects privacy, performs on downstream tasks, avoids bias, and is robust to attacks. 

2. A trust index that aggregates metrics within and across trust dimensions to score synthetic datasets based on configurable weights reflecting priorities and tradeoffs between dimensions. The index enables ranking and selection of synthetic data.

3. Quantification of uncertainty in the trust index across different splits of real data used for training and evaluating synthetic data generators. This allows robust ranking under uncertainty.

4. Demonstration of trust-index driven model selection and validation to align synthetic data generation with prescribed trust requirements. Experiments on tabular, time-series and text data showcase improved utility, fairness and robustness compared to real data baselines.

5. Proposed workflows connecting data scientists, governance experts, reviewers and certifiers for transparent development, auditing and oversight of synthetic data usage. Communication templates for an audit report are also provided.

In summary, the paper provides a holistic and rigorous framework for auditing and selecting trustworthy synthetic data that conforms to specified safety, fairness, privacy and performance requirements. The uncertainty aware trust index enables robust and reliable rankings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper proposes a holistic auditing framework to assess the trustworthiness of synthetic data across multiple dimensions like fidelity, privacy, utility, fairness and robustness using quantitative metrics, and demonstrates this framework on various datasets and models to enable selection and ranking of synthetic data based on desired trade-offs between these trust dimensions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a holistic auditing framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of synthetic datasets across multiple dimensions like fidelity, privacy, utility, fairness and robustness. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- Most prior work has focused on auditing individual aspects of trust in isolation, such as just privacy or just fairness. This paper provides a more comprehensive framework that considers multiple trust dimensions together. 

- The framework allows specifying weights between different trust dimensions to reflect tradeoffs and priorities for different use cases. This provides more flexibility compared to approaches optimized for a single objective.

- The paper evaluates the framework across diverse datasets (tabular, time series, text) which is more extensive than prior work focused on a single modality.

- The framework introduces a trust index for ranking and selecting synthetic datasets based on the auditing results. This provides a principled way to choose datasets that align with specified trust requirements. 

- Uncertainty quantification is incorporated in the auditing process through evaluating metrics across different splits of the real data. This captures variability due to the data itself versus just the synthetic generator.

- The paper demonstrates using the framework to do trust-based model selection and data augmentation within the training loop of generators like TabFormers. This allows directly optimizing and controlling trust tradeoffs in the synthetic data.

- The framework design allows modular addition of new metrics and trust dimensions as needed. The current set of metrics covers key aspects but can be extended.

Overall, the scope and rigor of the auditing framework across trust dimensions, data modalities and use cases goes significantly beyond prior related work in this emerging area. The techniques introduced provide an advanced toolkit for evaluating and improving trustworthiness of synthetic data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more sophisticated and scalable differential privacy mechanisms for training large generative models like Transformers. The authors mention fully sharded data parallel training as a promising approach.

- Extending the auditing framework to other specialized data modalities beyond tabular, time series, and text. Examples mentioned include code, medical images, graphs, and molecules. 

- Adding more specialized metrics and dimensions for evaluating fidelity, utility, fairness, etc. that are tailored to different data types and applications.

- Extending the framework to multi-task, multi-modal settings which pose additional challenges for trust auditing.

- Integrating the framework with "policy packs" that preset parameters, thresholds, metrics, and explanations based on application domain and legal/policy landscape.

- Operationalizing the framework into a full auditing platform with workflows connecting data scientists, reviewers, certifiers, regulators, and other stakeholders.

- Studying the multi-dimensional tradeoffs between trust, utility, fairness, privacy, etc. in a more rigorous way.

- Validating the approach more thoroughly on a wider range of real-world datasets and use cases.

- Comparing different copula methods for aggregating metrics within a trust dimension.

So in summary, the authors lay out research directions to enhance the technical components of the framework, integrate it with application domains/policies, scale it up, and empirically validate its usefulness. The overall goal is to make trust-based auditing and model selection a practical reality.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a holistic framework for auditing the trustworthiness of synthetic data generated by AI models. The framework evaluates synthetic data along five key dimensions: fidelity, privacy, utility, fairness and robustness. For each dimension, relevant metrics are computed and then aggregated into dimension-level indices using a copula method. These indices are then combined into an overall trust index using a weighting scheme that reflects the relative importance of each dimension based on the application context. The framework allows ranking and selection of synthetic data and models according to the trust index. Uncertainty in the trust index is also quantified across different splits of the real data used for training/evaluation. The authors demonstrate the framework on various use cases with tabular, time series and natural language data. The trust index allows selection of synthetic data that leads to improved utility, fairness and robustness compared to models trained on real data. The paper also discusses integrating the framework into workflows connecting different stakeholders for transparency and accountability. Overall, the holistic assessment and ability to control trust tradeoffs are key strengths of the auditing framework proposed.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a holistic framework for auditing the trustworthiness of synthetic data generated by AI models. The framework evaluates synthetic datasets along multiple trust dimensions: fidelity, privacy, utility, fairness, and robustness. For each dimension, relevant metrics are computed to assess the risks and alignment of the synthetic data with socio-technical requirements. The metrics under each dimension are aggregated into a trust dimension index using a copula method. The framework then combines these indices into an overall trust index for a synthetic dataset using weighting schemes that reflect priorities and trade-offs between the trust dimensions. 

The authors apply their framework to audit several synthetic datasets generated for tabular, time-series, and natural language data across use cases in banking, healthcare, and education. The framework is used to rank multiple synthetic datasets and select the best model and checkpoint during training of "TrustFormer" models. Comparisons to real datasets show synthetic data can outperform on utility, fairness and robustness when selected using the trust index. The framework provides interpretability and transparency through the dimension indices and enables controlling trust trade-offs in synthetic data generation. Limitations are the assumption of independent dimensions and the difficulty connecting metrics to policies.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a holistic framework for auditing the trustworthiness of synthetic data across multiple modalities like tabular, time-series, and natural language. The framework evaluates synthetic datasets along five trust dimensions - fidelity, privacy, utility, fairness and robustness. Each dimension is assessed using relevant metrics. These metrics are first aligned to have consistent polarity and then aggregated using a copula method to get dimension-level indices. The overall trustworthiness is quantified through a trust index which is a weighted combination of the dimension indices. The weights allow incorporating acceptable trade-offs between the dimensions based on application needs. The framework can rank multiple synthetic datasets using the trust index and also drive model selection during training to get controllable trust trade-offs. It is showcased on diverse real-world use cases spanning different data modalities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting a holistic framework for auditing the trustworthiness of synthetic data generated by AI models. The key questions it is addressing are:

- How can we evaluate whether synthetic datasets meet requirements for fairness, privacy, utility, fidelity to the real data, and robustness? 

- How can we quantify tradeoffs between these different dimensions of trust when generating synthetic data?

- How can the framework enable transparent reporting and accountability in using synthetic data?

- How can it be used to align generative models to prescribed trust requirements through techniques like trust-index driven model selection?

Some key problems the paper is aiming to address:

- Synthetic data can have risks like privacy leaks, bias amplification, poor utility if not evaluated properly.

- Generative models can be misaligned with trust requirements if model selection doesn't account for trust tradeoffs.

- Lack of transparency and holistic evaluation makes it hard to determine if synthetic data is trustworthy. 

- Evaluating synthetic data requires assessing multiple trust dimensions and their inherent tradeoffs.

To address these, the paper proposes:

- A framework to quantify metrics for different trust dimensions like fidelity, privacy, utility etc. 

- Aggregating these metrics into overall trust scores and indices.

- Tradeoff weights to align trust index with requirements.

- Ranking methods to compare and select synthetic data using trust index.

- Trust-index based model selection to align generative models with trust desiderata.

- Templates for audit reports to enable transparency.

So in summary, it provides a comprehensive approach to evaluate, control and report the trustworthiness of synthetic data based on prescribed requirements. The framework aims to enable responsible use of synthetic data in AI systems.
