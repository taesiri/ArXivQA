# [NeRF-DS: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Specular Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14435)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How to reconstruct and render high-quality novel views of dynamic scenes containing specular/reflective objects using neural radiance fields?The key points are:- Existing dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) models can reconstruct deforming/moving scenes from monocular videos by predicting a deformation field to warp different observations to a common canonical space. - However, they fail on scenes with specular/reflective objects because they do not model the orientation-dependent appearance changes during warping.- The paper proposes a surface-aware dynamic NeRF and mask-guided deformation field to address this limitation.Specifically:- The surface-aware NeRF conditions appearance prediction on surface properties like position and normal in the original observation space. This allows modeling view-dependent effects.- The mask-guided deformation provides stronger supervision for learning correspondences between observations of specular surfaces.- Experiments on a new dataset of dynamic scenes with specular objects show the proposed model significantly improves novel view synthesis compared to prior NeRF variants.In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling surface appearance changes and using mask guidance will allow neural radiance fields to reconstruct high-quality views of dynamic scenes with specular objects from monocular video. The experiments aim to validate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The key contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a surface-aware dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF-DS) to better model dynamic specular objects. 2. It introduces a mask guided deformation field to improve learning correspondences for specular surfaces under motion.3. It collects a new dataset of dynamic specular scenes for evaluating dynamic NeRF models. Specifically, the paper identifies two limitations of prior dynamic NeRF models when applied to specular objects:1. Ignoring original surface position/normal when warping to the canonical space causes conflicts in rendered color. 2. Drastic color changes of specular surfaces makes establishing correspondences difficult with only RGB supervision.To address the first issue, NeRF-DS conditions the radiance field on the observation space position/normal to allow surfaces to reflect different colors after warping to the canonical space. For the second issue, a mask guided deformation field is proposed. The mask provides consistent guidance for establishing correspondences despite color changes.Experiments on a new dynamic specular dataset demonstrate NeRF-DS significantly reduces rendering artifacts and improves quality compared to prior NeRF models.In summary, the key contribution is developing a surface-aware dynamic radiance field with mask guidance to enable high-quality novel view synthesis of challenging dynamic specular objects from monocular RGB video.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:This paper proposes NeRF-DS, a new neural radiance field model that improves novel view synthesis of dynamic specular objects from monocular videos by conditioning the color prediction on the surface position and orientation in the observation space and using an object mask to guide the deformation field learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in dynamic neural radiance fields:- It focuses specifically on modeling and reconstructing dynamic scenes containing specular/reflective surfaces, which has not been explored much before. Most prior work on dynamic NeRF focuses on general non-specular scenes.- It builds on top of state-of-the-art dynamic NeRF methods like HyperNeRF by reparameterizing the radiance field to condition color prediction on surface properties like normals and positions in the original observation space. This differs from other approaches that just warp everything to a canonical space. - The proposed mask-guided deformation field leverages object segmentation masks to help establish correspondence and guide learning of deformations. Using these masks as additional constraints is a relatively novel idea compared to other dynamic NeRF deformation techniques.- A new dataset of dynamic scenes with specular objects is introduced for evaluation, as most existing dynamic NeRF datasets lack much specularity. This provides a new challenging benchmark for future research.- Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate significant improvements in rendering quality on specular surfaces compared to prior state-of-the-art dynamic NeRF methods. This shows the proposed techniques are advancing the field.- Limitations like sensitivity to surface normal estimation and potential ways to improve are discussed. Overall the paper clearly advances dynamic NeRF modeling of specular surfaces in several novel ways compared to prior works.In summary, the key novelties are the surface-aware radiance field, mask-guided deformation field, and specular dataset that together push forward dynamic NeRF research for specular scenes. The comparisons show clear improvements over other state-of-the-art methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring surface priors or more constrained deformation models to improve the surface normal prediction. The paper mentions that the predicted surface normal can sometimes be misled by the reflected texture instead of representing the true geometry. Adding explicit surface priors or constraints into the deformation model could help guide the normal prediction.- Extending the model to handle interreflections. The current model makes an assumption of no self-reflections. Allowing interreflections would make the model applicable to more complex reflective scenes.- Improving view dependence modeling. The paper uses a view-dependent color branch, but does not explicitly model view-dependent effects like highlights. Incorporating more accurate BRDF modeling could potentially improve view-dependent appearance.- Scaling up the model for higher resolution and scene complexity. The experiments are done at a resolution of 480x270. Scaling the model to higher resolutions like megapixel images could enable reconstructions of more detailed scenes.- Exploring joint training over multiple scenes. The current model trains one NeRF independently per scene. Jointly training over multiple scenes with shared parameters could improve generalization.- Validating the model on real captured footage. The dataset consists of controlled captured videos. Testing on more complex real world videos could reveal further areas for improvement.In summary, the key suggested future work revolves around improving geometry and appearance modeling, scaling up the model, and evaluating on more complex data. This could help address remaining limitations and make the model more robust and practical.
