# [NeRF-DS: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Specular Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14435)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How to reconstruct and render high-quality novel views of dynamic scenes containing specular/reflective objects using neural radiance fields?The key points are:- Existing dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) models can reconstruct deforming/moving scenes from monocular videos by predicting a deformation field to warp different observations to a common canonical space. - However, they fail on scenes with specular/reflective objects because they do not model the orientation-dependent appearance changes during warping.- The paper proposes a surface-aware dynamic NeRF and mask-guided deformation field to address this limitation.Specifically:- The surface-aware NeRF conditions appearance prediction on surface properties like position and normal in the original observation space. This allows modeling view-dependent effects.- The mask-guided deformation provides stronger supervision for learning correspondences between observations of specular surfaces.- Experiments on a new dataset of dynamic scenes with specular objects show the proposed model significantly improves novel view synthesis compared to prior NeRF variants.In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling surface appearance changes and using mask guidance will allow neural radiance fields to reconstruct high-quality views of dynamic scenes with specular objects from monocular video. The experiments aim to validate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The key contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a surface-aware dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF-DS) to better model dynamic specular objects. 2. It introduces a mask guided deformation field to improve learning correspondences for specular surfaces under motion.3. It collects a new dataset of dynamic specular scenes for evaluating dynamic NeRF models. Specifically, the paper identifies two limitations of prior dynamic NeRF models when applied to specular objects:1. Ignoring original surface position/normal when warping to the canonical space causes conflicts in rendered color. 2. Drastic color changes of specular surfaces makes establishing correspondences difficult with only RGB supervision.To address the first issue, NeRF-DS conditions the radiance field on the observation space position/normal to allow surfaces to reflect different colors after warping to the canonical space. For the second issue, a mask guided deformation field is proposed. The mask provides consistent guidance for establishing correspondences despite color changes.Experiments on a new dynamic specular dataset demonstrate NeRF-DS significantly reduces rendering artifacts and improves quality compared to prior NeRF models.In summary, the key contribution is developing a surface-aware dynamic radiance field with mask guidance to enable high-quality novel view synthesis of challenging dynamic specular objects from monocular RGB video.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:This paper proposes NeRF-DS, a new neural radiance field model that improves novel view synthesis of dynamic specular objects from monocular videos by conditioning the color prediction on the surface position and orientation in the observation space and using an object mask to guide the deformation field learning.
