# [AWOL: Analysis WithOut synthesis using Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03042)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing 3D shape models like SMPL for humans or SMAL for animals can generate shapes by sampling from the latent space. However, sampling often produces unrealistic mixes of shapes or requires expert knowledge to select valid regions of the space. 
- For uncommon species not in the training set, these models cannot extrapolate beyond what they have seen.  
- The goal is to control such models to produce novel, realistic shapes, including unseen species, using natural language descriptions.

Method: 
- Key idea: Map from CLIP text embeddings to parameters of a 3D graphics model like SMAL. Leverage the dense CLIP space so that interpolating language maps to interpolating/extrapolating shapes.

- Use Real-NVP, a normalizing flow model, to learn a mapping from CLIP embeddings to shape parameters of SMAL or a procedural tree model. 

- Real-NVP uses learned binary masks and compressed hidden layers, trained with an L1 reconstruction loss on text+shape pairs.

- Can provide text, images, or both to generate shapes. Images are encoded in CLIP space.

Contributions:
- A new animal model, SMAL+, extending SMAL with more species.

- First text-driven method to generate rigged 3D animal models, including unseen species. State-of-the-art dogs.  

- First text-driven generation of 3D trees with fine detail from a procedural model.

- Qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm the hypothesis that language can interpolate and extrapolate shapes.

- Ability to generate from images by embedding images in CLIP space.

In summary, the key idea is using language to control parameters of an existing graphics model to achieve generalization. The mapping is learned with a normalizing flow model between CLIP and parameter spaces.
