# [RaceMOP: Mapless Online Path Planning for Multi-Agent Autonomous Racing   using Residual Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous racing is important for developing self-driving car technology, but most methods rely on pre-mapped racing lines rather than being able to dynamically navigate unknown environments. 
- Mapless online path planning using only local sensor observations is more flexible and robust but poses challenges for safely overtaking opponents at high speeds due to the limited planning horizon.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces RaceMOP, a novel mapless online path planning method for multi-agent autonomous racing of F1TENTH vehicles.
- RaceMOP combines an artificial potential field (APF) method as a base policy for local navigation and collision avoidance, with residual policy learning to enable longer-horizon planning for overtaking maneuvers.  
- The residual policy is represented as a deep neural network that takes past sensor observations as input and outputs a correction to the APF policy actions. This allows reasoning about future states for more optimal maneuvers.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstration that the proposed RaceMOP method outperforms existing mapless planners in the ability to safely overtake opponents in simulated races, generalizing to unknown tracks.
- Introduction of a new technique for fusing the learned residual policy with the base APF policy using a truncated Gaussian distribution that prevents bias.
- Detailed analyses showing RaceMOP's capability for long-horizon decision-making and interpretation of the learned robust overtaking behaviors in various scenarios.
- Provision of open-source implementation to facilitate further research.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards mapless online planning for high-speed racing scenarios by combining classical and learning-based methods in a novel way. The results showcase safer and more optimal planning than reactive approaches reliant only on immediate sensor inputs.
