# [Efficient Language Adaptive Pre-training: Extending State-of-the-Art   Large Language Models for Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages like Polish is challenging due to insufficient training data. Currently, there are no high-quality open-source Polish LLMs with over 100 billion tokens.
- Relying on external AI solutions from big tech companies entails financial costs and limited data control. There is a need for localized LLMs to ensure data sovereignty.

Proposed Solution:
- Perform language adaptive pre-training (LAPT) by fine-tuning an existing English LLM (Mistral-7B) on a high-quality Polish dataset of 276 million tokens.
- Further fine-tune the resulting model (Curie-7B-v1) on downstream tasks from the KLEJ benchmark to evaluate performance.

Key Outcomes:
- Curie-7B-v1 achieves the lowest perplexity score of 3.02 on a Polish test set, demonstrating proficiency in the language.
- On 8 out of 9 KLEJ tasks, Curie-7B-v1 obtains an average score of 89.35%, nearly matching the top model's 90.7% which was trained on far more data. 
- The entire LAPT process requires only 2-3% of the data size used by other models, highlighting efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates the viability of quickly adapting English LLMs to new languages with limited computational resources. 
- Introduces an open-source Polish LLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance in text generation and understanding.
- Provides a model to facilitate development of Polish language AI solutions for enterprises.
- Underscores the potential of localized LLMs for ensuring data sovereignty.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient method to adapt existing LLMs to new languages using far less data, with results showing Curie-7B-v1 reaching parity with top Polish models. The model and methods promise to expand access to high-quality language-focused AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces an efficient method called Language Adaptive Pre-training to adapt a 7 billion parameter English language model to generate high-quality Polish text, which achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art Polish models on text generation and language understanding tasks using only 2-3% of the typical dataset size.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper introduces an efficient method for adapting existing large English language models to generate high-quality text in Polish. Specifically, it utilizes Language Adaptive Pre-Training (LAPT) to fine-tune the 7 billion parameter Mistral-7B model on a dataset of 276 million Polish tokens. 

The resulting model, called Curie-7B-v1, achieves state-of-the-art results on 8 out of 9 tasks in the KLEJ language understanding benchmark, despite using only 2-3% of the tokens that other top Polish models were trained on. It also attains the lowest perplexity score of 3.02 on a test set, demonstrating its strong language modeling abilities.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that effective adaptation of large models to new languages is possible with LAPT and a relatively small corpus, rather than requiring extensive pre-training from scratch. This makes developing performant models for lower-resource languages much more feasible. The open-sourced Curie-7B-v1 model also helps address the lack of freely available, high-quality Polish language models.

The paper introduces an approach called Language Adaptive Pre-training (LAPT) to efficiently adapt existing English LLMs to generate high-quality text in Polish. Key methods used include LoRA and fine-tuning the model on a Polish text dataset to minimize perplexity.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a technique called Language Adaptive Pre-training (LAPT) to adapt a large English language model (LLM) to Polish. Can you explain in detail the process and objectives of LAPT? What are the key hyperparameters and implementation choices? 

2. The authors use a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) rather than full fine-tuning of the entire LLM. What are the advantages of using LoRA over classical fine-tuning approaches? How does it work?

3. The adapted LLM named Curie-7B-v1 achieves strong performance on 8 out of 9 downstream tasks in the KLEJ benchmark, rivaling the best Polish LLMs. What architectural properties and training strategies allow it to generalize well despite being trained on much less data?

4. The paper hypothesizes that techniques effective for domain adaptive pre-training in English could transfer to language adaptive pre-training for Polish. Do you think this is a reasonable assumption? What challenges are unique to language vs domain adaptation? 

5. Curie-7B-v1 struggles with the Cyberbullying Detection task. What limitations of the LAPT dataset and method may have contributed to this weakness? How could the model be improved?

6. The computational cost, time, and carbon footprint required to develop Curie-7B-v1 are orders of magnitude lower than training large models from scratch. Explain the cost and efficiency advantages in detail.

7. What policy and economic implications might the availability of performant open-source Polish LLMs have for businesses and researchers in Poland? What new opportunities does this enable?  

8. The paper hypothesizes that techniques like pruning and quantization could further improve the efficiency of language adaptive pre-training. Do you agree? How might these methods help and what challenges exist in implementing them?

9. What types of language understanding capabilities does perplexity evaluate? Why is lower perplexity indicative of better language model performance? How was it used to measure improvement?

10. The authors use grouped query attention and sliding window attention in the base LLM architecture. Explain how these mechanisms differ from standard attention. What advantages do they provide?
