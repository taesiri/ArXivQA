# [GMD: Controllable Human Motion Synthesis via Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12577)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop an effective method for controllable human motion synthesis that enables generating high-quality and diverse motions conditioned on both natural language descriptions and spatial constraints?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) By manipulating the motion representation to give more emphasis/importance to spatial information like trajectories, the coherence between spatial conditions and generated motions can be improved. 

2) Propagating sparse spatial guidance signals into dense signals can help drive the diffusion model to better conform to spatial constraints, even when the guidance is very sparse.

3) Integrating these ideas into a diffusion-based generative model can enable high-quality and controllable human motion synthesis based on both natural language and spatial constraints.

In summary, the main research question is how to develop an effective approach for controllable human motion synthesis with both language and spatial constraints. The key hypotheses relate to emphasizing spatial information and propagating sparse signals to achieve better coherence and control over the generated motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The proposal of Guided Motion Diffusion (GMD), a new method for generating controllable human motions using diffusion models. GMD incorporates spatial constraints like trajectories and obstacles into the motion generation process.

2. An "emphasis projection" technique to manipulate the motion representation to enhance coherence between spatial information like trajectories and the generated local poses. This helps ensure the motion matches given trajectories. 

3. A "dense signal propagation" technique to turn sparse spatial guidance signals (like a few keyframes) into denser signals. This prevents the model from ignoring the sparse guidance during sampling.

4. Extensive experiments validating GMD, including trajectory-conditioned motion generation, keypoint-conditioned generation, and obstacle avoidance. GMD enables controllable motion generation based on both text and spatial constraints, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in human motion modeling.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of spatial constraints into diffusion models for controllable human motion synthesis, enabled by the proposed emphasis projection and dense signal propagation techniques. The paper demonstrates strong improvements over prior arts in text-to-motion generation while also enabling new capabilities like trajectory following and obstacle avoidance.
