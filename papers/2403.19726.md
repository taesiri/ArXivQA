# [A Benchmark Evaluation of Clinical Named Entity Recognition in French](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Named entity recognition (NER) is important for extracting clinical information from electronic health records to support epidemiological studies. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and comparability of NER methods on French clinical text. 

Methods:
- The paper evaluates multiple pretrained masked language models (MLMs) on the clinical NER task in French, using 3 public benchmark datasets with gold annotations (DEFT, E3C, Quaero). 
- The MLMs evaluated include general French models (CamemBERT, FlauBERT, frALBERT), multilingual BERT, and French biomedical models (CamemBERT-bio, DrBERT).
- NER models are trained with NLStruct library and results are compared to a symbolic baseline. Evaluation considers both NER performance (precision, recall, F1) as well as carbon footprint.

Results: 
- Biomedical MLMs achieve the best NER performance overall, with CamemBERT-bio outperforming DrBERT. FlauBERT is competitive.  
- On 2 datasets, a knowledge-based model from prior work outperforms the MLMs.
- FrALBERT has the lowest carbon footprint, 20-63% less than other models, while still exceeding the baseline NER performance.

Contributions:
- First benchmark evaluation of multiple MLMs on French clinical NER using consistent evaluation and original gold annotations.
- Comparison of general French vs biomedical MLMs, with analysis of tradeoffs between NER performance and carbon impact. 
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art models still fall short of knowledge-based approaches on some French clinical NER datasets.
- Provides recommendations for selection of French MLMs for clinical NER based on performance needs and computational constraints.
