# [Self-supervised Learning on Graphs: Deep Insights and New Direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10141)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/goals appear to be:1) To deepen understandings on when, why, and which strategies of self-supervised learning (SSL) work with graph neural networks (GNNs) for the task of semi-supervised node classification.2) To propose a new direction called "SelfTask" to build advanced pretext tasks that can achieve state-of-the-art performance by exploiting task-specific self-supervised information.The key hypothesis seems to be that task-specific self-supervised information (leveraging label information of labeled nodes) can enable the design of more powerful pretext tasks compared to only using attribute or structure information.The paper first introduces various basic SSL pretext tasks and analyzes their impact on GNN performance through empirical studies. This is aimed at providing insights on when and why SSL works for GNNs. Then, based on the insights gained, the paper proposes the SelfTask framework to create advanced pretext tasks exploiting task-specific information. Experiments demonstrate SelfTask can achieve state-of-the-art performance, validating the hypothesis that task-specific SSL information is effective for building pretext tasks for GNNs.In summary, the central goals are to gain insights on SSL for GNNs and propose a new direction called SelfTask to design advanced pretext tasks leveraging task-specific information, with the key hypothesis that such information enables stronger pretext tasks. The empirical analysis and experiments aim to address these goals.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes advanced self-supervised pretext tasks called SelfTask that leverage labeled node information to improve graph neural networks for node classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance through empirical studies that provide insights on when and why SSL works for GNNs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief analysis of how this paper on self-supervised learning for graph neural networks compares to other related research:- Scope: This paper provides a comprehensive study of self-supervised learning specifically for graph neural networks. Many prior works have explored self-supervised learning in computer vision or natural language processing domains, but there is less work focused on graphs. So this provides a targeted analysis for GNNs.- Methods: The paper systematically evaluates a variety of basic self-supervised pretext tasks for graphs based on structure and attribute information. This analysis of simple methods provides insights that motivate more advanced task-specific pretext tasks proposed in the paper. Other papers tend to jump directly to proposing new self-supervised methods without this grounded empirical analysis.- Findings: Through the empirical studies, the paper makes several key observations about when and why certain pretext tasks are effective for GNNs. For example, global structure tasks tend to be more useful than local structure tasks. These insights are unique contributions.- Advanced Methods: Built on the analysis, the paper introduces the novel direction of SelfTask pretext tasks that incorporate node label information. Methods like CorrectedLabel iteratively improve context label vectors to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The advanced tasks leverage multiple information sources in new ways.- Evaluation: The paper includes extensive experiments analyzing design choices and comparing performance on multiple standard graph datasets. The empirical results strongly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed techniques.Overall, the systematic analysis of basic tasks, grounded insights, and new SelfTask direction make significant contributions over existing self-supervised learning literature. The paper advances the understanding and techniques for effectively applying self-supervision to graph neural networks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on their analysis, the authors propose some promising future research directions in self-supervised learning for graph neural networks:- Explore new pretext tasks beyond structure and attribute information. The authors introduce the concept of "regular task equivalence", where node similarity is defined with respect to the downstream task labels. This opens the door to designing more advanced pretext tasks that incorporate task-specific information in creative ways.- Apply the proposed SSL strategies for pre-training GNNs. The insights from this work could help design pretraining objectives and frameworks to learn generalizable graph representations.- Study SSL for other graph learning tasks beyond node classification. The analysis and insights may generalize to graph tasks like link prediction, graph classification, etc.- Design SSL methods specialized for large-scale graphs. Some of the proposed techniques may not scale well to graphs with millions of nodes. New methods need to be efficient and scalable.- Theoretically analyze when and why SSL works for GNNs. Rigorous analysis can lead to better task design and integration strategies.- Explore SSL for advanced GNN architectures. The techniques here are applied to basic GNN models like GCN. More work is needed to adapt them for modern architectures.- Develop SSL for heterogeneous, dynamic, and temporal graphs. The unique properties of these graphs require designing specialized pretext tasks.In summary, the authors lay a solid foundation for SSL on graphs and outline several exciting directions for developing more powerful and generalized self-supervised graph representation learning techniques.
