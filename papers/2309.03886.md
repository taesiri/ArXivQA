# [A Function Interpretation Benchmark for Evaluating Interpretability   Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03886)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1) Can we create a comprehensive benchmark dataset to evaluate the ability of automated methods to interpret the behavior of black-box functions? 

2) Can pre-trained language models (LLMs) serve as a general-purpose backbone for interpretability when equipped with the capability to query opaque functions?

3) How accurately can off-the-shelf LLMs describe the behavior of real-world-relevant functions involving noise, composition, approximation, etc. when allowed to conduct interactive experiments?

4) Do LLMs exhibit capabilities like forming and testing hypotheses and updating descriptions based on new experimental evidence that are critical for interpretability?

5) How does initialization with relevant exemplars versus open-ended experimentation impact LLM performance on function interpretation?

In summary, the central focus seems to be on developing a rigorous benchmark for evaluating automated function interpretation methods, with a specific interest in assessing the promise of LLMs as general-purpose interpretability tools. Key hypotheses tested using the new FIND benchmark are whether LLMs can act like scientists to infer black-box function behavior through interactive experimentation, and whether their performance depends strongly on search initialization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be introducing FIND, a new benchmark dataset and framework for evaluating interpretability methods. Specifically:

- FIND consists of over 2000 functions across numeric, string, and neural module domains, with procedurally generated ground truth explanations. This allows testing interpretation methods' ability to produce accurate explanations when ground truth structure is known.

- The functions are designed to reflect real-world challenges like composition, noise, and bias. This helps evaluate whether methods can uncover and explain complex behaviors seen in real models. 

- FIND is interactive - methods can probe the functions to generate data for interpreting their behavior. This tests hypothesis formation, experiment design, and updating explanations based on new data.

- The authors provide baseline results using large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4. Though powerful, these models still failed to adequately describe 48% of functions, showing room for improvement.

- FIND enables targeted evaluations for specific use cases like finding inputs that cause incorrect predictions.

Overall, FIND seems to be the first large-scale, flexible benchmark for testing interpretation methods, with potential to accelerate development and evaluation of automated techniques. The interactive setting and procedural function generation appear to be key innovations compared to prior explanation datasets and benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces FIND, a new benchmark for evaluating how well automated methods can interpret and describe the behavior of black box functions, with the goal of advancing the development of more sophisticated interpretability techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of interpretability and explanation evaluation:

- Benchmark focus: This paper introduces FIND, a new benchmark for evaluating interpretation methods on procedural functions with known ground truth structure. Many prior benchmarks have focused on evaluating explanations of decisions from black box models (e.g. pointing to salient input regions) rather than evaluating global explanations of full modules/functions. 

- Interactive evaluation: FIND provides an interactive evaluation protocol where the interpreter actively queries the black box function to generate data and explanations. This differs from common evaluation paradigms that test interpretation of predefined inputs/exemplars. The interactive setting tests the interpreter's ability to strategically explore functions.

- Diverse functions: FIND contains over 2000 procedural functions across multiple domains (math, text, neural modules). Many prior benchmarks for full-text explanation have used small numbers of synthetic puzzles (e.g. 19 puzzles in Bills et al. 2023, 54 modules in Singh et al. 2023). FIND's diversity tests generalization.

- Scalable ground truth: By procedurally generating functions, FIND provides full ground truth explanations at scale rather than relying on limited labeled examples. This enables standardized quantitative evaluation.

- Learned baseline: The authors demonstrate a learned baseline using LLMs like GPT-3/4 for interpretation. While promising, failures show current LLMs alone may not robustly automate even high-level interpretability. Most prior work has focused on bespoke explanation systems.

In summary, FIND moves toward a more rigorous, standardized, and scalable paradigm for evaluating global interpretability methods, complementing an existing focus on local explanation evaluation. The findings suggest opportunities for developing more generalized interpretation systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the FIND benchmark to include white-box function interpretation problems, where interpreters have access to internal components and parameters of functions instead of just treating them as black boxes. The authors suggest incorporating functions that resemble neural network circuits, where interpreters must describe individual sub-computations.

- Developing additional tools and capabilities that could be provided to interpreter models to improve their performance, beyond just black-box access to functions. Examples include capabilities for smarter search/sampling of the input space and synthesizing new examples. 

- Using FIND to evaluate targeted aspects of interpreter performance relevant to specific use cases, like identifying inputs where model accuracy is reduced, determining how to intervene on inputs to change outputs, and pedagogical applications to help users simulate model behavior.

- Incorporating new functions, interaction paradigms, and evaluation metrics into FIND as interpretability methods advance, to continue reflecting capabilities needed to understand real-world model behaviors.

- Applying automated interpretation methods built on FIND to real neural networks, to understand how performance generalizes. Using insights from FIND to guide application of these methods to practical problems.

- Developing theoretical frameworks for the interpretation process itself, like modeling it as scientific theory building and refinement.

So in summary, the authors propose extending FIND along several dimensions to better support development and evaluation of sophisticated interpretation methods, and ultimately applying methods proven on FIND to real models in order to generate useful insights about their behaviors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces FIND, a new benchmark for evaluating automated methods for interpreting functions. FIND consists of over 2000 procedurally generated functions across numeric, string, and neural module domains, along with ground truth explanations. The functions are designed to reflect real-world complexity like noise, composition, approximation, and bias. The authors demonstrate the benchmark by evaluating baseline language model interpreters like GPT-4, which are prompted to interact with and explain the opaque functions. Though GPT-4 shows some scientific reasoning capacity, producing code and text descriptions through hypothesis formation and experimentation, it still fails to adequately characterize 48% of FIND's functions. This highlights the utility of FIND for measuring progress in automated interpretability, and that current LMs alone may not robustly automate even high-level interpretability tasks without augmentation. Overall, FIND provides a diverse, extensible benchmark to drive and evaluate methods for interpreting model components, with potential to enhance interpretability efforts through accelerated experimentation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces FIND, a new benchmark for evaluating methods that interpret the behavior of black box functions. FIND contains over 2000 functions across numeric, text, and neural module domains, along with ground truth explanations of each function's behavior. The functions are designed to reflect real-world complexity, including composition, noise, approximation, and bias. 

The authors demonstrate FIND on several baseline language model interpreters including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. They find that with simple prompting, these models are able to interactively probe the functions, form hypotheses, and update their understanding based on results. However, they also uncover limitations - the models struggle to fully characterize more complex functions, especially local corruptions. The authors suggest augmenting LMs with additional search and reasoning tools to enable more robust automation of interpretability. Overall, FIND provides a rigorous and extensible framework for developing and evaluating methods that produce human-readable explanations of black box systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces FIND (Function INterpretation and Description), a new benchmark dataset and framework for evaluating interpretability methods on their ability to explain the behavior of black box functions. FIND contains over 2000 functions across numeric, text, and neural module domains, procedurally generated to include real-world complexities like noise, composition, approximation, and bias. The functions are instrumented as opaque modules that candidate interpretation methods ("interpreters") can probe by evaluating the module on different inputs and observing its outputs. Interpreters must conduct experiments to gather data, then produce natural language and/or code descriptions explaining the function's behavior, which are evaluated against ground truth explanations. As a demonstration, the authors test baseline interpreters built using large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, which are able to query functions and produce structured interpretations. While some complex functions are recovered, the benchmarks reveals limitations of off-the-shelf LMs for robust interpretation. FIND provides a framework for rigorously evaluating and comparing automated interpretation methods on diverse tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be introducing a new benchmark dataset called FIND (Function Interpretation and Description) for evaluating methods for interpreting and explaining black box functions. The key ideas I gathered are:

- Interpretability research aims to explain the functions and concepts learned by AI systems, but evaluating explanation methods is challenging without ground truth explanations. 

- Existing benchmarks are limited in scope and scale. There are no large datasets with ground truth explanations for a diverse set of black box functions.

- This paper introduces FIND, a large dataset of over 2000 functions with ground truth explanations. The functions span numeric, text, and neural module domains. Different types of complexity like noise, composition, approximation, and bias are introduced.

- FIND enables evaluating how well automated interpretation methods can recover the ground truth behavior and explanations of functions that resemble components inside real neural networks.

- They provide baseline results using large language models like GPT-4 to interactively probe functions and generate explanations. Off-the-shelf LMs show some capability but also limitations, indicating FIND will be useful for driving more sophisticated interpretation methods.

In summary, the key problem is the lack of ground truth benchmark datasets to evaluate interpretability methods, and this paper introduces FIND as a large and diverse function interpretation benchmark to help drive progress in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a large language model (LLM) as the backbone for interpreting black-box functions. What are the potential advantages and limitations of using an LLM for this task compared to more traditional program synthesis techniques? How could the LLM's capabilities be augmented to make it more suitable for robust and automatic interpretation?
