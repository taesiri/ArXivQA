# [A Function Interpretation Benchmark for Evaluating Interpretability   Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03886)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1) Can we create a comprehensive benchmark dataset to evaluate the ability of automated methods to interpret the behavior of black-box functions? 2) Can pre-trained language models (LLMs) serve as a general-purpose backbone for interpretability when equipped with the capability to query opaque functions?3) How accurately can off-the-shelf LLMs describe the behavior of real-world-relevant functions involving noise, composition, approximation, etc. when allowed to conduct interactive experiments?4) Do LLMs exhibit capabilities like forming and testing hypotheses and updating descriptions based on new experimental evidence that are critical for interpretability?5) How does initialization with relevant exemplars versus open-ended experimentation impact LLM performance on function interpretation?In summary, the central focus seems to be on developing a rigorous benchmark for evaluating automated function interpretation methods, with a specific interest in assessing the promise of LLMs as general-purpose interpretability tools. Key hypotheses tested using the new FIND benchmark are whether LLMs can act like scientists to infer black-box function behavior through interactive experimentation, and whether their performance depends strongly on search initialization.
