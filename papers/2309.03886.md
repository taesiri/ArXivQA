# [A Function Interpretation Benchmark for Evaluating Interpretability   Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03886)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1) Can we create a comprehensive benchmark dataset to evaluate the ability of automated methods to interpret the behavior of black-box functions? 2) Can pre-trained language models (LLMs) serve as a general-purpose backbone for interpretability when equipped with the capability to query opaque functions?3) How accurately can off-the-shelf LLMs describe the behavior of real-world-relevant functions involving noise, composition, approximation, etc. when allowed to conduct interactive experiments?4) Do LLMs exhibit capabilities like forming and testing hypotheses and updating descriptions based on new experimental evidence that are critical for interpretability?5) How does initialization with relevant exemplars versus open-ended experimentation impact LLM performance on function interpretation?In summary, the central focus seems to be on developing a rigorous benchmark for evaluating automated function interpretation methods, with a specific interest in assessing the promise of LLMs as general-purpose interpretability tools. Key hypotheses tested using the new FIND benchmark are whether LLMs can act like scientists to infer black-box function behavior through interactive experimentation, and whether their performance depends strongly on search initialization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper seems to be introducing FIND, a new benchmark dataset and framework for evaluating interpretability methods. Specifically:- FIND consists of over 2000 functions across numeric, string, and neural module domains, with procedurally generated ground truth explanations. This allows testing interpretation methods' ability to produce accurate explanations when ground truth structure is known.- The functions are designed to reflect real-world challenges like composition, noise, and bias. This helps evaluate whether methods can uncover and explain complex behaviors seen in real models. - FIND is interactive - methods can probe the functions to generate data for interpreting their behavior. This tests hypothesis formation, experiment design, and updating explanations based on new data.- The authors provide baseline results using large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4. Though powerful, these models still failed to adequately describe 48% of functions, showing room for improvement.- FIND enables targeted evaluations for specific use cases like finding inputs that cause incorrect predictions.Overall, FIND seems to be the first large-scale, flexible benchmark for testing interpretation methods, with potential to accelerate development and evaluation of automated techniques. The interactive setting and procedural function generation appear to be key innovations compared to prior explanation datasets and benchmarks.
