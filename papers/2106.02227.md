# Conversations Are Not Flat: Modeling the Dynamic Information Flow across   Dialogue Utterances

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How to model the dynamic information flow across dialogue utterances in order to better capture conversational dynamics for dialogue generation?The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the context flow and semantic influence of each utterance will allow the model to better capture the dynamics of natural conversations compared to simply concatenating the dialogue history. The paper proposes a model called DialoFlow that introduces a flow mechanism to model the evolving dialogue context and the semantic influence of each utterance. The goal is to learn representations that reflect the natural dynamics of human-human conversations for more human-like dialogue generation.Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:- Modeling the context flow at the utterance level will allow capturing conversational dynamics better than flat concatenation of context.- Addressing the semantic influence of each utterance will help measure its impact on the changing dialogue context.- Leveraging the learned representations of context flow will enable better open-domain dialogue generation compared to prior work.- The context flow representations can be used to define an automatic dialogue evaluation metric that correlates well with human judgements.So in summary, the central research question is how to model conversational dynamics for improved open-domain dialogue generation, via the proposed DialoFlow model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new model called DialoFlow to model the dynamic information flow across dialogue utterances. Specifically, it designs a flow mechanism to capture the context flow and models the semantic influence brought about by each utterance. 2. It proposes three training objectives - context flow modeling, semantic influence modeling, and response generation modeling - to optimize DialoFlow during pre-training on large-scale conversational data.3. It proposes an automatic evaluation metric called Flow score to evaluate the quality of interactive dialogues based on the pre-trained DialoFlow model.4. Experiments show DialoFlow achieves significant improvements on dialogue generation compared to baselines like DialoGPT. The Flow score also correlates highly with human ratings for evaluating dialogue systems.5. Overall, modeling the dynamic information flow and semantic influence helps generate more informative responses and enables automatic evaluation of interactive dialogues. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed DialoFlow model and Flow score metric through empirical evaluations.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel way to model conversational context dynamics and leverage that for dialogue generation and evaluation through the DialoFlow model and Flow score metric.
