# [Interpretable Meta-Learning of Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00477)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new meta-learning approach called Context-Affine Multi-Environment Learning (CAMEL) for modeling physical systems under varying experimental conditions. CAMEL exploits the affine structure often found in physical systems' equations with respect to physical parameters. It represents the prediction function as an affine transformation of low-dimensional task-specific weights with a shared feature map. This simple yet powerful structure enables efficient adaptation to new environments with minimal data. Importantly, CAMEL can identify physical parameters of linearly parameterized systems, lending interpretability. Experiments demonstrate that CAMEL matches state-of-the-art meta-learning techniques in performance when modeling complex systems, while being far more computationally efficient. For linearly parametrized systems, CAMEL significantly outperforms other methods in few-shot adaptation thanks to its built-in structure. This enables applications like online adaptive control and simulation-based scientific discovery. Overall, by encoding basic physical structure, CAMEL bridges the gap between model complexity, generalization ability, efficiency and interpretability when meta-learning physical systems.
