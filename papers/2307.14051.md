# [3D Semantic Subspace Traverser: Empowering 3D Generative Model with   Shape Editing Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a novel 3D shape generative model called 3D Semantic Subspace Traverser that can generate high-quality 3D shapes and enable semantic shape editing. The central hypothesis is that by embedding local linear subspace models into the generator network, the model can discover semantic dimensions in the latent space that correspond to meaningful shape attributes. Traversing along these semantic dimensions allows control over the attributes of generated shapes.The key research questions addressed are:- How to build an effective 3D shape generative model that produces high quality and diverse results? They propose a latent-space GAN architecture with a continuous 3D shape code grid representation.- How to enable semantic shape editing by discovering interpretable dimensions? They introduce local linear subspace models embedded in the generator via differentiable embedding. Each dimension corresponds to a semantic attribute.- Can traversing discovered semantic dimensions produce meaningful and consistent shape edits? The results demonstrate coherent shape editing by manipulating both global and local shape attributes.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging local linear subspace models can uncover semantic dimensions to enable semantic shape editing in an unsupervised 3D generative model. The results support this hypothesis and show the promise of the proposed 3D Semantic Subspace Traverser.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a novel semantic generative model named 3D Semantic Subspace Traverser for 3D shape generation and editing.- It introduces a new latent-space GAN that uses shape code grids to enable implicit-function-based 3D generation. This can produce shapes with diverse topological structures.- It presents a 3D local linear subspace model to unsupervisedly and progressively discover interpretable and controllable dimensions from generator layers. - It achieves superior performance in both 3D shape generation and editing compared to previous methods.Specifically, the 3D Semantic Subspace Traverser utilizes implicit functions to represent shapes and combines a latent-space GAN with linear subspace models. The GAN generates shape code grids that can be decoded into 3D shapes. The local linear subspace models are embedded into the GAN to discover semantic dimensions from feature maps. Each dimension corresponds to a particular semantic attribute. By traversing the coefficients of those dimensions, the model can edit the attributes of generated shapes.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new semantic generative model that leverages local linear subspace models and a latent-space GAN to achieve high-quality 3D shape generation and enable semantic editing of shapes.
