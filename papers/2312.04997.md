# [Beyond Transduction: A Survey on Inductive, Few Shot, and Zero Shot Link   Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04997)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a systematic literature review of recent research on link prediction (LP) in knowledge graphs beyond the traditional transductive setting. Specifically, the authors focus their analysis on inductive LP (ILP), few-shot LP (FSLP), and zero-shot LP (ZSLP). Through a rigorous selection process, 129 relevant papers are analyzed across three dimensions: model designs, datasets used for evaluation, and terminology used to define tasks. The authors find that while research interest in these knowledge-scarce LP settings is growing significantly, there is a lack of standardized benchmark datasets and inconsistent terminology used to define ILP, FSLP, and ZSLP. This makes fair comparison of models difficult. To remedy this, the authors propose an "anchor-based" naming scheme that unambiguously characterizes LP settings based on which elements (head, relation, tail) in test triples were observed during training. Using this scheme reveals that some settings remain relatively unexplored, like predicting links where all elements are unseen. Overall, this paper helps better delineate ILP, FSLP and ZSLP through precise terminology and points out open challenges regarding evaluation procedures and methodology. The proposed unified naming scheme is an important step towards reducing terminology confusion in knowledge-scarce LP research.
