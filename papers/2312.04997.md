# [Beyond Transduction: A Survey on Inductive, Few Shot, and Zero Shot Link   Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04997)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper discusses the tasks of inductive link prediction (ILP), few-shot link prediction (FSLP) and zero-shot link prediction (ZSLP) in knowledge graphs, which go beyond the traditional transductive link prediction setting. The key problems highlighted are:

1) Lack of commonly accepted benchmark datasets, leading to results not being comparable across papers. 

2) Confusing terminology used to define ILP, with different papers referring to the same experimental setup using different names, and vice versa. This makes it very difficult to understand exactly what task and setting is being evaluated.

3) Need for clearly delineating ILP, FSLP and ZSLP from each other. Currently there is overlap in how some papers define and use these terms.

Proposed Solution:

1) The paper first systematically surveys 129 papers on ILP, FSLP and ZSLP, analyzing trends, models and datasets used.

2) It then deeply analyzes the terminology issues, inconsistent definitions and lack of clarity around these 3 tasks. 

3) Finally, it proposes a simple and consistent anchor-based nomenclature to unambiguously define test setups in terms of which elements - head, relation or tail - are seen vs unseen. This nomenclature clearly maps existing work to 8 possible test triple configurations.

Main Contributions:

1) First broad survey focused specifically on ILP, FSLP and ZSLP for link prediction in knowledge graphs

2) Identifies and highlights the serious issue of confusing terminology in defining these tasks

3) Proposes a simple anchor-based naming scheme to consistently define test setups in terms of seen vs unseen elements

4) Maps all surveyed papers to the proposed taxonomy, revealing trends and gaps

The paper makes an important contribution towards standardizing terminology and evaluation of ILP, FSLP and ZSLP tasks, enabling better understanding and fairer comparison of techniques. The proposed taxonomy also reveals under-explored settings for future work.
