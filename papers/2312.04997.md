# [Beyond Transduction: A Survey on Inductive, Few Shot, and Zero Shot Link   Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04997)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a systematic literature review of recent research on link prediction (LP) in knowledge graphs beyond the traditional transductive setting. Specifically, the authors focus their analysis on inductive LP (ILP), few-shot LP (FSLP), and zero-shot LP (ZSLP). Through a rigorous selection process, 129 relevant papers are analyzed across three dimensions: model designs, datasets used for evaluation, and terminology used to define tasks. The authors find that while research interest in these knowledge-scarce LP settings is growing significantly, there is a lack of standardized benchmark datasets and inconsistent terminology used to define ILP, FSLP, and ZSLP. This makes fair comparison of models difficult. To remedy this, the authors propose an "anchor-based" naming scheme that unambiguously characterizes LP settings based on which elements (head, relation, tail) in test triples were observed during training. Using this scheme reveals that some settings remain relatively unexplored, like predicting links where all elements are unseen. Overall, this paper helps better delineate ILP, FSLP and ZSLP through precise terminology and points out open challenges regarding evaluation procedures and methodology. The proposed unified naming scheme is an important step towards reducing terminology confusion in knowledge-scarce LP research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically reviews the literature on inductive, few-shot, and zero-shot link prediction in knowledge graphs, analyzes issues with terminology and benchmarks, and proposes a unified nomenclature for categorizing test triples based on whether the head, relation, and tail are seen or unseen.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It is the first to systematically review the existing literature around the few-shot link prediction (FSLP), zero-shot link prediction (ZSLP), and inductive link prediction (ILP) settings. It provides an overview of model designs, datasets, and general trends.

2. It conducts a thorough analysis that clearly pinpoints a lack of rigorous conceptualization and understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of each setting. In particular, it observes that the tasks do not have consistent definitions between papers, limiting the possibility of comparison. 

3. It provides a terminological discussion that aims to clarify questions around the tasks and propose a unifying understanding of each setting.

4. It proposes a consistent and pragmatic naming nomenclature for the full range of link prediction settings, which avoids overlap between them. It maps transductive, inductive, few-shot, and zero-shot link prediction to concrete settings in the terminology.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic survey of the field, an analysis that reveals inconsistencies in terminology and definitions, and a proposal for a unified nomenclature to refer to the different link prediction settings unambiguously.

The paper provides a systematic literature review of research on link prediction in knowledge graphs under inductive, few-shot, and zero-shot settings. It discusses issues around inconsistencies in task definitions, terminology, and benchmark datasets used across different papers. The authors then propose a unified nomenclature based on "anchors" (seen elements) in test triples to unambiguously characterize different research settings. The goal is to enable clearer comparisons between models and work towards a common understanding and terminology in this emerging research area around knowledge-scarce link prediction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an anchor-based nomenclature for non-transductive link prediction settings. What is the key idea behind this nomenclature and what are the benefits compared to existing terminologies?

2. The nomenclature uses a boolean indexing approach with 0 denoting unseen elements and 1 denoting seen elements. Explain the rationale behind this choice and discuss how it allows unambiguously describing test triple configurations.  

3. The paper maps existing works on few-shot, zero-shot and inductive link prediction to the proposed nomenclature. What are the key insights gained from this mapping regarding terminology discrepancies and under-explored settings?

4. Table 3 provides a mapping of existing works to the proposed nomenclature. Compare and contrast the distribution of works across the different settings. What does this reveal about the current state of research?

5. The I_{000} setting with fully unseen test triples is currently unexplored. Discuss the challenges associated with this setting and outline potential ideas or model designs to tackle it.  

6. The paper argues that few-shot learning involves some representation learning from support triples while inductive learning does not necessarily require/use such triples. How does this delineate between few-shot and inductive settings? Is there still potential overlap?

7. The survey excludes certain related works dealing with temporal, multi-modal or hypergraph link prediction. How could the proposed nomenclature be extended to accommodate such works as well?

8. The lack of standardized benchmarks is highlighted as an issue, especially for inductive link prediction. Suggest concrete ideas for establishing more unified benchmarks in this area.

9. The survey focuses on model designs for tackling knowledge-scarce link prediction. Outline other relevant open problems or challenges that deserve more attention, either from a model or evaluation perspective.  

10. The nomenclature is essentially based on the signature of test triples. Discuss potential limitations of relying solely on this and whether complementary perspectives on task definitions could be beneficial.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper discusses the tasks of inductive link prediction (ILP), few-shot link prediction (FSLP) and zero-shot link prediction (ZSLP) in knowledge graphs, which go beyond the traditional transductive link prediction setting. The key problems highlighted are:

1) Lack of commonly accepted benchmark datasets, leading to results not being comparable across papers. 

2) Confusing terminology used to define ILP, with different papers referring to the same experimental setup using different names, and vice versa. This makes it very difficult to understand exactly what task and setting is being evaluated.

3) Need for clearly delineating ILP, FSLP and ZSLP from each other. Currently there is overlap in how some papers define and use these terms.

Proposed Solution:

1) The paper first systematically surveys 129 papers on ILP, FSLP and ZSLP, analyzing trends, models and datasets used.

2) It then deeply analyzes the terminology issues, inconsistent definitions and lack of clarity around these 3 tasks. 

3) Finally, it proposes a simple and consistent anchor-based nomenclature to unambiguously define test setups in terms of which elements - head, relation or tail - are seen vs unseen. This nomenclature clearly maps existing work to 8 possible test triple configurations.

Main Contributions:

1) First broad survey focused specifically on ILP, FSLP and ZSLP for link prediction in knowledge graphs

2) Identifies and highlights the serious issue of confusing terminology in defining these tasks

3) Proposes a simple anchor-based naming scheme to consistently define test setups in terms of seen vs unseen elements

4) Maps all surveyed papers to the proposed taxonomy, revealing trends and gaps

The paper makes an important contribution towards standardizing terminology and evaluation of ILP, FSLP and ZSLP tasks, enabling better understanding and fairer comparison of techniques. The proposed taxonomy also reveals under-explored settings for future work.
