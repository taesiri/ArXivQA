# [Differentiable and accelerated spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14670)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents novel algorithms to efficiently compute differentiable spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms on the sphere and rotation group. The algorithms leverage recursive computation of Wigner $d$-functions that is highly parallelizable and stable to high degrees. By tightly coupling the Wigner $d$-function recursion with separable spherical transforms, the overall algorithmic structure exhibits extreme parallelism well-suited for GPUs and other accelerators. A hybrid automatic and manual differentiation approach is developed to enable efficient computation of gradients while avoiding memory overheads of full automatic differentiation or complexities of full manual differentiation. The algorithms are implemented in the new S2FFT software package using the JAX framework. S2FFT supports various sphere samplings and arbitrary spin functions. Comprehensive benchmarking shows the transforms achieve up to 400x speedup compared to prior C codes, and close to optimal scaling across multiple GPUs, effectively exhibiting linear time complexity given sufficient parallelism. The differentiable spherical transforms provided by S2FFT open up many new analysis techniques and applications requiring gradients, such as physics-enhanced machine learning models.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The development of novel algorithmic structures for accelerated and differentiable computation of generalised Fourier transforms on the sphere and rotation group (spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms). The algorithms are designed to be highly parallelizable to leverage modern hardware accelerators like GPUs.

2) A recursive algorithm to compute Wigner d-functions that is stable to high harmonic degrees, parallelizable, and facilitates efficient automatic differentiation.

3) Algorithms for computing spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms that interleave the Wigner recursion with the harmonic transform computations. This avoids large memory overheads and allows the algorithms to scale to high resolutions. 

4) A hybrid automatic and manual differentiation approach to efficiently compute gradients while avoiding memory overheads or implementation complexities.

5) An open-source software library called S2FFT implemented in JAX that realizes the algorithms and provides accelerated, differentiable spherical transforms on the sphere and rotation group. It supports various spherical samplings and exhibits up to 400x speedups compared to alternative codes.

In summary, the main contribution is the development of novel, accelerated, and differentiable algorithms and software for spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms on the sphere and rotation group. A key innovation is the highly parallelizable and memory-efficient computational approach.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a recursive algorithm to compute the Wigner $d$-functions. How does this recursion ensure numerical stability compared to other approaches, and why is numerical stability important when computing at high harmonic degrees?

9) The software implementation supports both real and complex signals of arbitrary spin. What is the significance of supporting signals of arbitrary spin in spherical harmonic analysis?

10) The paper mentions the software implementation is "sampling agnostic" regarding choice of spherical sampling scheme. What software engineering strategies help decouple the sampling scheme from the spherical transform implementation?
