# [SAME: Sample Reconstruction Against Model Extraction Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models are valuable but require extensive resources to develop. Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) enables easier deployment but poses privacy and security threats like model extraction attacks.  
- Existing defenses against model extraction attacks have limitations: require auxiliary out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, user query histories, white-box model access, interference with model training, make unrealistic assumptions about attack types.

Proposed Solution:
- A new defense called SAME - Sample Reconstruction Against Model Extraction.
- Uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to reconstruct query samples. Reconstruction loss indicates anomaly.  
- An Auxiliary Model trained on MAE reconstructions matches victim model predictions. Deviation loss also indicates anomaly.
- Anomaly score combines: (1) MAE reconstruction loss (2) Auxiliary model deviation loss
- Imposes minimal assumptions on defender capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Show weaknesses of classifier-based detection, especially for unseen malicious queries.
- Introduce SAME, using sample reconstruction for detection, reducing demands on defender.
- Shows SAME versatility as add-on to enhance existing defenses.  
- Demonstrates SAME effectiveness over state-of-the-art defense methods against multiple model extraction attack types via extensive experiments.
