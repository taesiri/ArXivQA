# [Bayesian Active Learning for Censored Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Bayesian active learning aims to actively select the most useful data points to acquire labels for and improve the model's predictive performance. However, existing Bayesian active learning methods like BALD fail for censored regression problems, where the response/target variables are only partially observed.
- Specifically in censored regression, we observe clipped/censored values of the true response variable instead of the actual values. Since censored observations do not contain full information about the true values, it is challenging to determine how much information acquiring their labels would provide for improving the model.

Proposed Solution:
- Derive the entropy and mutual information equations for censored distributions to quantify the amount of information in censored observations. This accounts for the fact that censored observations contain less information than uncensored ones.

- Propose a novel C-BALD acquisition function for active learning in censored regression, based on the mutual information between model parameters and censored observations. This measures the expected information gain from acquiring censored observations.

- Since C-BALD relies on the unknown censorship status and thresholds of new unlabeled data points, explicitly model these variables to estimate C-BALD on new data points.

Main Contributions:

1. Formulation and derivation of entropy and mutual information for censored distributions, to quantify information in censored observations.

2. A C-BALD acquisition function for Bayesian active learning tailored to censored regression problems, using the derived information theoretic quantities. 

3. A modeling approach to estimate the censorship probabilities and thresholds for new unlabeled data points, in order to estimate C-BALD values for active learning of censored data.

4. Empirical evaluation showing C-BALD outperforms BALD and other baselines on both synthetic and multiple real-world censored regression datasets.
