# [Enhancing Historical Image Retrieval with Compositional Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14287)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing content-based image retrieval methods for analyzing historical image data often overlook significant non-semantic information like image composition. This limits their applicability for flexible exploration across diverse themes.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel image retrieval approach that synergizes composition and content features to enhance historical image retrieval.

- The method has two key components:
  1) Composition Clues Network (CCNet): Extracts composition features and composition maps from images. Based on CACNet architecture.
  2) Content-Based Image Retrieval Network (CBIRNet): Merges composition clues from CCNet with content feature extraction for retrieval. 

- CCNet is trained on KU-PCP dataset to classify image composition.
- CBIRNet is trained on selected images from HISTORIAN dataset to learn content and composition features.

- During CBIRNet training, the composition map from CCNet is fused with content features from CBIRNet to guide content feature learning.

Key Contributions:

- Introduces composition information from computational aesthetics into historical image retrieval to uncover patterns beyond semantics.

- Proposes a dual CNN architecture to extract and integrate crucial composition and content cues for retrieval.

- Demonstrates both quantitatively and qualitatively that retrieval network guided by composition information can identify images closer to the query image across various styles compared to using content features alone.

- Provides an efficient pipeline leveraging shot boundary data to construct training pairs with similar and dissimilar content/composition from historical video data.

In summary, the key innovation is utilizing composition and content synergistically to enhance historical image retrieval, with experiments confirming the benefits of incorporating formal composition principles.
