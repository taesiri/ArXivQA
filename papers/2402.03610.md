# [RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Planning with Contextual Memory for Multimodal   LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03610)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent advances have enabled the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents for complex decision-making applications like robotics, gaming, and API integration. However, the ability to leverage past experiences during current decision-making, an innate human skill, remains a significant challenge for these models. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose Retrieval-Augmented Planning (RAP), a novel framework to enhance LLM agents' planning capacities by retrieving and utilizing relevant past experiences. 

Key aspects:
- RAP stores logs of prior successful task executions in a memory bank, including context, actions taken, and observations.

- For a new task instance, RAP selectively retrieves the most relevant memory samples based on similarity of context. This provides vital environmental knowledge to inform the agent's planning.

- The retrieved experiences are provided as additional context to the LLM agent before action generation. This allows in-context learning to derive smarter actions grounded in relevant prior executions.

- RAP handles both text-only and multimodal observations, making it versatile across different environments. For embodied tasks, it can leverage visual perceptions in memory retrieval.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes RAP, a novel planning framework for LLM agents that strategically utilizes relevant experiences from memory to enhance reasoning.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across textual benchmarks like ALFWorld and Webshop. Outperforms prior approaches by 13-33\% on task success metrics.

- Demonstrates RAP enables memory-augmented planning for multimodal LLM agents in simulated robotics tasks. Boosts success rates by 13-18\% over baseline embodied agents.

- First framework enabling memory retrieval techniques for multimodal agent's planning, pioneering effort in this domain.

- Showcases RAP's potential in advancing LLM agent functionality for complex, real-world decision-making applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing RAP, a novel framework that enhances LLM agents' planning capacity by storing past experiences and intelligently retrieving them based on similarity with the current situation to guide decision-making. 

2. RAP is capable of being applied in both textual environments and multimodal embodied tasks, making it one of the first efforts in employing memory retrieval techniques for multimodal agents.

3. Empirical evaluations demonstrate RAP's effectiveness, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance in textual scenarios and notably enhances multimodal LLM agentsâ€™ performance for embodied tasks.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the RAP framework that leverages past experiences to improve LLM agents' planning, and showing that it works well in both text and multimodal environments, advancing the capabilities of LLM agents for complex real-world applications.
