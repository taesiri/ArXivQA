Many papers have focused on individual components like memory or planning, while this paper systematically relates them within a unified framework.Construction Methods: The paper comprehensively surveys the diverse techniques used for each module, like strategies for memory reading/writing/reflection, planning with/without feedback, tool usage in action modules, etc. It relates the techniques adopted in various papers to the corresponding modules. This enables structured analysis of the wide array of construction approaches.Applications: The paper categorizes applications into three broad domains - social science, natural science, and engineering. It highlights the diverse roles LLM agents have played, from experiment assistants to software developers. Reviewing applications provides insights into usefulness and limitations. Evaluation: A key contribution is discussing the landscape of evaluation strategies, differentiating between subjective methods like human annotation and objective techniques like environmental simulation. Surveying evaluation approaches is crucial for standardized assessment.In summary, this paper provides a holistic framework to systematically connect and review the disparate efforts within the nascent field of LLM-based autonomous agents. The structured analysis of construction, applications, and evaluations offers insights into the current state and future directions. The unified perspective presented differentiates it from domain-specific surveys.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors of the paper suggest several potential future research directions:- Developing methods to enhance LLMs' role-playing capabilities, such as through fine-tuning on data from uncommon roles or designing tailored prompt/architecture strategies. This would allow agents to better simulate a wider range of roles and behaviors.- Exploring generalized human alignment techniques that enable agents to align with diverse human values for different applications like simulation, rather than just correct values. This involves developing prompting strategies to "realign" pretrained LLMs. - Improving the robustness of prompt frameworks that coordinate the different modules of agents like memory, planning, etc. Small prompt changes can substantially alter agent behaviors, so developing unified and robust prompts is important.- Mitigating the issue of hallucination in agents by incorporating human feedback loops and verification to correct erroneous information. This can reduce risks from incorrect outputs.- Addressing the knowledge boundary issue where agents leverage knowledge beyond what ordinary humans would have, which harms believable simulation. Methods to constrain usage of user-unknown knowledge could help.- Enhancing the efficiency of agents by optimizing the auto-regressive inference of LLMs that underlies agent querying and actions. Faster inference would enable more real-time interactions.- Developing more comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and metrics to better assess the general capabilities of agents across diverse domains and modalities.- Exploring emerging applications of agents like scientific discovery, engineering design, education, etc. and tailoring agent architectures accordingly.In summary, the key future directions involve improving agents' role-playing, alignment, robustness, efficiency, evaluation, and expanding their application domains. Advancing agents along these dimensions will unlock their potential to assist and collaborate with humans across an ever-widening range of real-world tasks and scenarios.

The main method is to provide a systematic review and taxonomy of existing research in this field from three key aspects: 1) Agent construction: The authors propose a unified framework comprising four modules - profiling, memory, planning, and action. By selectively enabling/disabling modules, this framework can encompass most existing agent architectures. Common techniques for each module are reviewed, such as handcrafting vs. LLM-based profile generation, memory formats like natural language or embeddings, planning with/without feedback, and tool-based vs self-generated actions.2) Agent application: The applications of LLM-based agents are categorized into three domains - social science, natural science, and engineering. For each domain, representative studies are summarized, covering areas like social simulation, robotics, code generation, experiment assistance etc. 3) Agent evaluation: Both subjective (human evaluation) and objective (quantitative metrics) strategies are discussed. Subjective methods like annotations and Turing tests are common currently. Objective techniques analyze aspects like task success, human similarity, efficiency, and employ benchmarks for standardized assessment.
