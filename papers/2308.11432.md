# A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it does not appear to have a clearly stated central research question or hypothesis. The paper seems to present a general survey and taxonomy of the field of large language model (LLM) based autonomous agents. The key aspects covered in the paper are:- Construction of LLM-based autonomous agents: The paper proposes a unified framework for agent architecture comprising modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action. It reviews various techniques used in previous works for designing these modules.- Applications of LLM-based agents: The paper summarizes the application of LLM agents in diverse domains like social science, natural science, and engineering. It provides an overview of representative works in each application area.- Evaluation of LLM-based agents: The paper discusses commonly used subjective and objective evaluation strategies for assessing agent capabilities. It reviews evaluation metrics, benchmarks, and testing methods employed in prior studies.Overall, the paper aims to provide a holistic survey of the emerging field of LLM-based autonomous agents. It does not appear to have a specific hypothesis or central research question. The key contribution is a systematic taxonomy and review of agent construction, applications, and evaluation based on existing literature. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges and potential future directions in this domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper seem to be:1) It provides a comprehensive survey of the field of large language model (LLM) based autonomous agents. The paper organizes and reviews existing research on LLM agents from three key perspectives - construction, application, and evaluation.2) For agent construction, the paper proposes a unified framework composed of four modules - profiling, memory, planning, and action. By selectively disabling some of these modules, the framework can encompass the architectures used in most prior LLM agent research. The paper also summarizes common fine-tuning strategies for agent construction.3) For agent application, the paper categorizes and reviews the use of LLM agents across three broad domains - social science, natural science, and engineering. Representative applications in each domain are discussed. 4) For agent evaluation, the paper examines both subjective (human) and objective (quantitative) strategies. Different types of evaluation metrics, benchmarks, and methodologies are analyzed. 5) The paper identifies several open challenges and future directions for research on LLM-based autonomous agents. It also provides a reference repository to track the latest work in this rapidly evolving field.Overall, this paper delivers a holistic overview of the emerging field of LLM agents through a systematic taxonomy and review of agent construction, application, and evaluation techniques based on existing literature. The discussions on open problems and future directions also help guide and accelerate progress in this domain.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a survey on large language model based autonomous agents, reviewing existing work on agent construction, application, and evaluation, and proposing a unified framework and taxonomy encompassing modules like profiling, memory, planning, and action to capture the diverse agent architectures.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other related research on large language model (LLM)-based autonomous agents:Overall Framework: The paper proposes a unified framework for LLM-based agent architecture comprising four key modules - profiling, memory, planning, and action. This provides a holistic lens to view and connect prior works by considering which modules they implement. Many papers have focused on individual components like memory or planning, while this paper systematically relates them within a unified framework.Construction Methods: The paper comprehensively surveys the diverse techniques used for each module, like strategies for memory reading/writing/reflection, planning with/without feedback, tool usage in action modules, etc. It relates the techniques adopted in various papers to the corresponding modules. This enables structured analysis of the wide array of construction approaches.Applications: The paper categorizes applications into three broad domains - social science, natural science, and engineering. It highlights the diverse roles LLM agents have played, from experiment assistants to software developers. Reviewing applications provides insights into usefulness and limitations. Evaluation: A key contribution is discussing the landscape of evaluation strategies, differentiating between subjective methods like human annotation and objective techniques like environmental simulation. Surveying evaluation approaches is crucial for standardized assessment.In summary, this paper provides a holistic framework to systematically connect and review the disparate efforts within the nascent field of LLM-based autonomous agents. The structured analysis of construction, applications, and evaluations offers insights into the current state and future directions. The unified perspective presented differentiates it from domain-specific surveys.
