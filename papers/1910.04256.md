# [Explaining image classifiers by removing input features using generative   models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04256)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

Can integrating a generative inpainter into existing attribution methods improve the accuracy and robustness of the resulting explanations?

More specifically, the authors investigate whether using a generative model to fill in removed parts of an image (rather than simpler approaches like blurring/graying out) allows existing attribution methods like Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations to produce better explanations that are:

1) More plausible counterfactual samples that appear realistic and in-distribution. 

2) More accurate according to common evaluation metrics like object localization, deletion metrics, and saliency.

3) More robust to hyperparameter changes.

The key hypothesis seems to be that using a generative model to produce realistic "interventions" (image edits) will allow attribution methods to better estimate the importance of different input features, resulting in explanations that are more faithful and less sensitive to parameters. Overall, the paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of using generative models to improve explanation methods.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can integrating a generative image inpainter into existing perturbation-based attribution methods improve the accuracy and reliability of the resulting explanations?

Specifically, the authors hypothesize that using a generative inpainter to remove pixels/features from an input image (rather than simply graying/blurring/adding noise) will produce more realistic and in-distribution counterfactual samples. This in turn will lead to attribution maps that are:

1) More accurate at localizing the key discriminative regions of the input.

2) More robust to hyperparameter changes in the attribution methods. 

3) Based on counterfactual samples that are more faithful to the true data distribution.

To test this hypothesis, the authors incorporate a state-of-the-art generative inpainter into three representative attribution methods (Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations). They then evaluate whether the resulting "G-methods" outperform their original counterparts on metrics related to localization, sensitivity, and sample faithfulness.

In summary, the central research question is whether harnessing generative models can improve the accuracy and reliability of perturbation-based explanation methods. The hypothesis is that using a generative inpainter to remove features will yield better explanations than existing removal techniques like blurring or adding noise.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:

Can integrating generative models into perturbation-based attribution methods improve the accuracy and reliability of the resulting explanations?

Specifically, the authors propose using generative inpainting models to remove features from an image when computing attribution maps, rather than traditional perturbation techniques like blurring or adding noise. 

Their central hypothesis is that using a generative model to produce more realistic counterfactual examples (by inpainting removed features) will result in attribution maps that are:

1) More accurate at localizing important features according to standard evaluation metrics.

2) More robust to variations in hyperparameters.

3) Based on perturbation samples that are more representative of the true data distribution.

So in summary, the paper is investigating whether generative models can be leveraged to improve perturbation-based attribution methods by producing more realistic and representative counterfactual examples to evaluate feature importance.

- The key focus of the paper is on using generative models to create more realistic counterfactual examples for perturbation-based attribution methods like Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations. This is a novel approach compared to prior work which tended to use simpler perturbations like blurring, graying, or adding random noise.

To my knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study showing generative models can enhance explanation methods in this way.

- The proposed MP2-G method outperforms related work like FIDO-CA that also tried to leverage generative inpainting but used a different objective. MP2-G is also shown to be more accurate and reliable than the original MP formulation it is based on.

- For evaluating explanation methods, the paper relies on common benchmark metrics like object localization, deletion, and saliency metrics. This allows direct comparison to prior work, though the field still lacks standardized rigorous evaluation.

- The findings contribute to the broader goal of developing explanation methods that produce counterfactuals that better match human intuitions and the true data distribution. Using generative models is a promising approach compared to heuristic perturbations.

In summary, the paper advances the state-of-the-art in explanation methods by demonstrating the utility of generative models.

Overall, this is an important contribution towards building more accurate and reliable explanations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other research in explaining image classifiers:

- The key focus of this paper is on improving perturbation-based attribution methods by using generative models to synthesize more realistic counterfactual samples when removing input features. This is a novel approach compared to prior work which perturbed images in unrealistic ways like blurring, adding noise, or graying out regions.

- The paper shows that integrating a pre-trained generative inpainter improves three representative attribution methods (Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations) on two large image classification datasets (ImageNet and Places365). Specifically, it generates more plausible counterfactuals, produces more accurate explanations according to various metrics, and makes the methods more robust to hyperparameters.

- This is the first work to systematically demonstrate the value of using generative models to improve the faithfulness and reliability of attribution methods. Prior work like FIDO-CA also tried using an inpainter but did not find improvements over baselines. The key differences here are the choice of "deletion" versus "preservation" objectives and modifications to the attribution methods like the proposed MP2 variant.

- The paper compares against relevant perturbation-based methods like blurring, adding noise, graying out regions, etc. It also extensively evaluates against FIDO-CA as a closely related approach. The improvements over all these methods substantiate the advantages of the proposed generative approach.

- The findings are consistent across multiple attribution algorithms, datasets, classifiers, and generative models. This demonstrates the generalizability of the approach. In contrast, most prior work focused on improving individual attribution methods.

In summary, the key novelties are in proposing a generative modeling approach for the first time to improve perturbation-based explanations and systematically showing its benefits over existing methods. The paper provides both qualitative insights and extensive quantitative experiments to make a convincing case for this approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related work in explaining image classifiers:

The key contribution of this paper is integrating generative image inpainting methods into perturbation-based attribution techniques to generate more realistic counterfactual samples. The authors show that using a pretrained DeepFill inpainter improves the faithfulness and robustness of three representative attribution methods - Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations. 

The typical way attribution methods perturb the input is by blurring, adding noise, or graying out regions. However, the authors argue these can produce unrealistic, out-of-distribution examples that classifiers were not trained on. Therefore, explanations on such inputs may be unreliable or unfaithful. 

To address this, they propose using a generative inpainter to fill in removed regions, which produces samples more consistent with the true data distribution. Qualitatively, their approach generates more plausible perturbations than existing techniques. Quantitatively, it also improves localization, deletion, and saliency metrics across ImageNet and Places365 datasets.

The most related work is FIDO-CA, which also incorporated an image inpainter into an attribution method. However, a key difference is the optimization objective - FIDO-CA uses a "preservation" objective that often results in unrealistic samples, whereas this work uses a "deletion" objective better suited for the inpainter. Consequently, the proposed methods outperform FIDO-CA.

Overall, this work provides strong evidence that leveraging generative models can improve perturbation-based explanations. It is the first to demonstrate inpainting as an effective technique for creating counterfactuals and more faithful attributions. The results are consistent across datasets and attribution methods, highlighting the general utility of this approach over existing perturbation strategies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing class-conditional inpainting models that are tailored to removing specific types of objects (e.g. animals, vehicles, etc). The authors note that the performance of their generative attribution methods depends on the capabilities of the inpainting model, so developing inpainters that are specialized for certain object classes could further improve the results.

- Exploring different generative models beyond inpainting for perturbing images, such as GANs. The authors propose using generative models as a general strategy to create more realistic perturbations, so testing other types of models could reveal new insights.

- Developing quantitative metrics and benchmark datasets for evaluating attribution methods. The authors rely on proxy metrics like object localization since there are no standardized quantitative evaluation protocols. Establishing better evaluation methodologies is an important direction.

- Applying the proposed methods to additional attribution algorithms beyond the representative ones tested. The authors demonstrate the approach on three common methods, but evaluating on more algorithms could demonstrate the broader value.

- Testing the approach on more complex image datasets. The experiments focus on object-centric and scene images, but applying to datasets with more diversity could reveal limitations.

- Exploring ways to improve the optimization stability and hyperparameters of methods like Meaningful Perturbations. The authors propose a variant MP2 to make the original MP method more stable, but further enhancements could be beneficial.

In summary, the main future directions relate to improving the generative models, expanding the evaluation methodology, and applying the approach to new attribution algorithms, datasets, and optimization techniques. The core idea of using generative models for perturbation appears promising based on the initial results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing class-conditional inpainters that are tailored to removing specific types of objects (e.g. birds, cars, etc). The authors found that the performance of generative attribution methods depends on how capable the inpainter is at removing the discriminative features of the target class. A class-conditional inpainter trained specifically on images of birds could potentially further improve the results.

- Experimenting with more advanced generative models and inpainting techniques beyond DeepFill v1/v2. The authors note that further improvements may be possible by using more capable generative models and free-form inpainting techniques.

- Evaluating the faithfulness and robustness of explanations on a broader range of datasets and classifier architectures. The authors tested on ImageNet and Places365 datasets using ResNet-50 classifiers. Expanding the evaluation to more datasets and model architectures could provide further evidence on the usefulness of the proposed approach.

- Developing quantitative metrics and ground truth datasets for evaluating explanation faithfulness. The authors rely on proxy metrics like object localization since there are no perfect ground truth explanation datasets. Developing better quantitative evaluation protocols could further validate the improvements provided by generative attribution methods.

- Extending the approach to other perturbation-based explanation methods besides SP, LIME and MP. The integration of generative models could potentially improve other perturbation-based methods.

- Studying the effects of incorporating generative models on gradient-based explanation methods. The current work focuses on perturbation-based methods. Evaluating the impact on gradient-based explanations could be an interesting direction.

In summary, the key suggestions are developing better class-conditional inpainting models, evaluating on more diverse datasets/models, creating better evaluation procedures, and extending the approach to other explanation methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing attribution methods that incorporate stronger, class-conditional generative models as priors for removing input features. The authors found that the performance of their proposed G-methods depends on the capabilities of the inpainting model. They suggest exploring class-conditional generative models that could plausibly synthesize missing content based on the surrounding context and labels.

- Exploring other perturbation operations beyond removal for measuring feature attributions. The authors focused on removing features via an inpainting model, but suggest it could be promising to explore other causal interventions like inserting or modifying features. 

- Developing quantitative evaluation benchmarks and metrics for faithfulness of explanations. The authors relied on proxy metrics like object localization and deletion for evaluating explanation accuracy. They suggest an important direction is establishing standardized datasets and quantitative metrics for faithfulness.

- Applying similar generative model integration approaches to other types of explanations like text, time-series or graph data. The authors focused on image classification explanations but suggest the overall principle of utilizing generative models to create realistic counterfactuals could generalize.

- Establishing theoretical connections between explanation methods and causal reasoning. The authors propose that explanations should abide by causal principles, and suggest formally establishing theoretical groundings in causality.

In summary, the main directions are: developing conditional generative models as priors, exploring other perturbation operations beyond removal, creating standardized faithfulness benchmarks, applying to other data modalities, and formalizing connections to causal theories.

This paper proposes integrating generative image inpainting models into attribution methods to generate more plausible counterfactual samples for explaining image classifiers. The paper tests this idea on three representative attribution methods - Sliding Patch (SP), LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations (MP). These methods originally remove features by blurring, adding noise, or graying out regions. Instead, the proposed approach uses a generative inpainter to fill in removed regions, producing more realistic samples.

The proposed approach generates counterfactual samples by removing features and filling in the gaps using a generative model trained on real images. Experiments demonstrate benefits across multiple attribution methods and datasets. The success of this approach suggests the importance of creating plausible counterfactuals for model explanation.

The paper proposes integrating a generative image inpainting model into existing perturbation-based attribution methods to improve the realism and accuracy of the explanations. The key idea is that current methods like Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations remove input features unnaturally by blurring, adding noise, or graying out patches.

Specifically, the authors integrate a pretrained generative inpainter into three representative attribution methods - Sliding Patch (SP), LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations (MP).

- The key question the paper examines is: can integrating a generative model to produce more realistic perturbations improve the accuracy and reliability of attribution methods for explaining classifiers?

The main contributions and findings of the paper are:

- Proposing to use a generative image inpainter to remove features from an image in a more realistic way when computing attributions.

- Integrating the inpainter into 3 representative attribution methods (Sliding Patch, LIME, Meaningful Perturbations). 

- Showing that the proposed generative variants (called "G-methods") improve accuracy on 3 common benchmarks and are more robust to hyperparameters.

- The generative methods produce more plausible and realistic counterfactual samples compared to blurring/graying out regions.

- A proposed variant of Meaningful Perturbations (MP2-G) outperforms prior art and is more accurate and reliable.

In summary, the key problem is producing more realistic perturbations for attribution methods, and the main contribution is showing that using generative models can improve faithfulness, accuracy and robustness of explanations.
