# Explaining image classifiers by removing input features using generative   models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:Can integrating a generative inpainter into existing attribution methods improve the accuracy and robustness of the resulting explanations?More specifically, the authors investigate whether using a generative model to fill in removed parts of an image (rather than simpler approaches like blurring/graying out) allows existing attribution methods like Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations to produce better explanations that are:1) More plausible counterfactual samples that appear realistic and in-distribution. 2) More accurate according to common evaluation metrics like object localization, deletion metrics, and saliency.3) More robust to hyperparameter changes.The key hypothesis seems to be that using a generative model to produce realistic "interventions" (image edits) will allow attribution methods to better estimate the importance of different input features, resulting in explanations that are more faithful and less sensitive to parameters. Overall, the paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of using generative models to improve explanation methods.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can integrating a generative image inpainter into existing perturbation-based attribution methods improve the accuracy and reliability of the resulting explanations?Specifically, the authors hypothesize that using a generative inpainter to remove pixels/features from an input image (rather than simply graying/blurring/adding noise) will produce more realistic and in-distribution counterfactual samples. This in turn will lead to attribution maps that are:1) More accurate at localizing the key discriminative regions of the input.2) More robust to hyperparameter changes in the attribution methods. 3) Based on counterfactual samples that are more faithful to the true data distribution.To test this hypothesis, the authors incorporate a state-of-the-art generative inpainter into three representative attribution methods (Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations). They then evaluate whether the resulting "G-methods" outperform their original counterparts on metrics related to localization, sensitivity, and sample faithfulness.In summary, the central research question is whether harnessing generative models can improve the accuracy and reliability of perturbation-based explanation methods. The hypothesis is that using a generative inpainter to remove features will yield better explanations than existing removal techniques like blurring or adding noise.

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:Can integrating generative models into perturbation-based attribution methods improve the accuracy and reliability of the resulting explanations?Specifically, the authors propose using generative inpainting models to remove features from an image when computing attribution maps, rather than traditional perturbation techniques like blurring or adding noise. Their central hypothesis is that using a generative model to produce more realistic counterfactual examples (by inpainting removed features) will result in attribution maps that are:1) More accurate at localizing important features according to standard evaluation metrics.2) More robust to variations in hyperparameters.3) Based on perturbation samples that are more representative of the true data distribution.So in summary, the paper is investigating whether generative models can be leveraged to improve perturbation-based attribution methods by producing more realistic and representative counterfactual examples to evaluate feature importance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing to integrate a generative image inpainter into existing attribution methods to remove input features when generating counterfactual explanations. This is shown to:- Generate more plausible and realistic counterfactual samples compared to existing perturbation techniques like blurring, adding noise, etc. - Improve the faithfulness/accuracy of three representative attribution methods (Sliding Patch, LIME, and Meaningful Perturbations) according to object localization, deletion, and saliency metrics.- Make the resultant explanations more robust to hyperparameter changes.2. Showing that a variant called MP2-G consistently outperforms the original Meaningful Perturbations (MP) method across the evaluation metrics. MP2-G eliminates several hyperparameters, making it more reliable than MP.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques across two large-scale image datasets (ImageNet and Places365) using separate pairs of pre-trained classifiers and inpainters.4. Providing analysis and intuitions for why the proposed generative methods result in more accurate and robust explanations compared to original counterparts.In summary, the key contribution is showing that generative models like inpainters can be effectively incorporated into attribution methods to improve faithfulness, accuracy, and reliability of explanations. This is demonstrated comprehensively across datasets, models, and evaluation metrics.
