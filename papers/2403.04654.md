# [Audio-Visual Person Verification based on Recursive Fusion of Joint   Cross-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04654)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Person verification using either faces or voices individually can deteriorate in performance when the corresponding signals are degraded. Fusing information from both faces and voices has the potential to improve robustness, but conventional fusion techniques like score-level fusion and simple feature concatenation fail to fully capture the rich complementary relationships across modalities. More effective modeling of both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships is needed.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a recursive fusion of joint cross-attention (RJCA) to simultaneously model intra- and inter-modal relationships for robust audio-visual person verification. A joint audio-visual feature representation is fed into a cross-attention module, and the resulting attended features are recursively fed back into the cross-attention module to progressively refine the representations. BLSTMs are also explored on the features from RJCA to improve temporal modeling.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduction of RJCA for audio-visual person verification which recursively fuses joint cross-attention features to model both intra- and inter-modal dynamics across faces and voices.

2) Exploration of BLSTMs on RJCA features to further enhance temporal modeling for the verification task.

3) Experiments conducted on VoxCeleb1 dataset demonstrating significant improvement over baseline fusion techniques and state-of-the-art methods. The ability of RJCA to capture complementary audio-visual relationships leads to notably enhanced robustness.

In summary, the paper presents an elegant joint cross-attention approach refined recursively to achieve robust person verification using audio-visual inputs. Both intra- and inter-modal dynamics are effectively captured.
