# [Embedded Multi-label Feature Selection via Orthogonal Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00307)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing least squares regression (LSR) based multi-label feature selection methods cannot effectively preserve discriminative information in multi-label data. LSR minimizes the horizontal distance from data points to the regression line, which loses some local structural information. This leads to suboptimal feature subsets being selected.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel embedded multi-label feature selection framework called Global Redundancy and Relevance Optimization in Orthogonal Regression (GRROOR). Instead of LSR, GRROOR uses orthogonal regression, which minimizes the perpendicular distance from points to the regression line. This retains more local structure related to label correlations. GRROOR also incorporates global feature redundancy minimization and global label relevance maximization into the orthogonal regression to get informative and non-redundant features. 

The objective function of GRROOR contains three main terms:
1) Orthogonal regression term with feature weighting to map features and capture local label correlations
2) Global label relevance term to project labels into a low-dimensional subspace that captures label semantics  
3) Global feature redundancy term to remove redundant features

An efficient iterative algorithm is presented to optimize this objective.

Main Contributions:
- Novel use of orthogonal regression instead of least squares regression for embedded multi-label feature selection. Better retains local structure and label correlations.
- Simultaneous optimization of global feature redundancy minimization and global label relevance maximization built into the orthogonal regression
- Outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods over 10 benchmark datasets and 6 evaluation metrics
- Provides an effective embedded feature selection solution for multi-label learning problems

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in multi-label feature selection by developing a new orthogonal regression based framework GRROOR that integrates global redundancy and relevance optimization. Experiments conclusively demonstrate its superiority.
