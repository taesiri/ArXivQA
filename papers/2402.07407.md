# [Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization":

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of chance constrained optimization (CCO). CCO refers to optimization problems with constraints that need to be satisfied with a certain probability (chance constraints). Solving CCO problems is challenging because the chance constraints require evaluating multi-dimensional integrals, which is intractable without strong assumptions. The paper focuses on the general case where the functions and distributions are nonlinear and unknown.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new approach called Conformal Predictive Programming (CPP) to solve CCO problems. The key idea is to leverage conformal prediction, a technique from machine learning, along with sampling the uncertainty to transform the CCO into a deterministic optimization problem. Specifically, CPP has two main steps:

1) Quantile Reformulation: Replace the chance constraint with a constraint defined over a quantile (computed from samples). This approximates the CCO as a deterministic problem.

2) Feasibility Guarantees: Use additional calibration samples and the quantile lemma to provide a probabilistic upper bound that certifies feasibility for the original CCO problem.

The paper presents two computationally tractable reformulations of CPP: CPP-KKT and CPP-MIP. The former encodes the quantile using KKT conditions while the latter uses a mixed integer program. The feasibility guarantees with CPP are marginal probabilities and do not require convexity assumptions like prior sampling-based approaches. The paper also shows an extension called Robust CPP to handle uncertainty distribution shifts.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes CPP method to solve general nonlinear CCO problems using ideas from conformal prediction
- Provides probabilistic feasibility guarantees without needing convexity assumptions
- Computationally tractable CPP reformulations using KKT and MIP
- Extendibility of CPP demonstrated through Robust CPP against distribution shifts
- Validation on nonlinear optimization and optimal control case studies

Key novelty is a new perspective for CCO through the lens of conformal prediction and feasibility guarantees from the quantile lemma.
