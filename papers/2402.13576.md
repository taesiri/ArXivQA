# [Improving Video Corpus Moment Retrieval with Partial Relevance   Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Improving Video Corpus Moment Retrieval with Partial Relevance Enhancement":

Problem:
- Video corpus moment retrieval (VCMR) is a new video retrieval task that aims to retrieve a relevant moment from a large corpus of untrimmed videos using a natural language query. 
- Untrimmed videos contain a lot of irrelevant content, with only a small fraction being relevant to the query (called the "target moment"). This poses challenges for effectively retrieving the target moment.
- Existing VCMR methods treat all video content equally, without emphasizing the query-relevant content. This leads to sub-optimal performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Partial Relevance Enhanced Model (PREM) that focuses more on query-relevant content in the videos to improve VCMR.
- VCMR involves two sub-tasks: video retrieval and single video moment retrieval. PREM uses different strategies to enhance partial relevance for each:
  - For video retrieval, a multi-modal collaborative video retriever is introduced. It creates query representations tailored to each modality in the video to match relevant content.
  - For moment retrieval, a "focus-then-fuse" moment localizer is proposed. It uses modality-specific gates to focus on important content in each modality first, before fusing information to localize the moment.
- Two training objectives are used to further emphasize query-relevant content:
  - Relevant content-enhanced contrastive learning for the video retriever
  - Adversarial training for the moment localizer

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of a partial relevance enhanced model (PREM) for improving VCMR by focusing more on query-relevant video content
- Introduction of specialized strategies to enhance partial relevance for both the video retrieval and moment retrieval sub-tasks
- State-of-the-art results on two VCMR benchmarks (TVR and DiDeMo), outperforming existing methods
- Ablation studies and visualizations demonstrating the effectiveness of partial relevance enhancement 

The key idea is to place greater emphasis on the small fraction of query-relevant content within untrimmed videos to enhance the model's ability to retrieve the target moment accurately. This is achieved through specialized model components and training techniques.
