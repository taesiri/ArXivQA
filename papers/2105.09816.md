# [Intra-Document Cascading: Learning to Select Passages for Neural   Document Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09816)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can an intra-document cascading model achieve comparable effectiveness to full BERT-based document ranking models while providing much lower query latency? The authors propose an Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM) that uses a less expensive model to select a small number of passages from each document, and then applies a more expensive but effective BERT model to only score those selected passages. This allows pruning away most of the passages in each document before passing to BERT scoring. The key research questions explored are:RQ1) Can IDCM match the effectiveness of scoring all passages with BERT but at lower computation cost and latency?RQ2) How does the number of passages selected by the first model influence the efficiency vs effectiveness tradeoff?RQ3) How does IDCM compare to BERT in terms of variance in query latency? RQ4) How accurately does the passage selection model recall the highest scoring BERT passages?The goal is to show IDCM can achieve similar ranking quality as BERT applied to all passages, but with much lower computational cost and query latency, as well as reduced variance in query time. The experiments aim to demonstrate this through comparison of ranking metrics, efficiency measurements, and analysis of passage selection accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM), a novel neural ranking architecture that improves effectiveness and efficiency for document retrieval. Specifically:- IDCM uses a cascade within documents, with a fast passage selection module followed by scoring with a more expensive but effective module (e.g. BERT). This allows pruning non-relevant passages before passing top ones to BERT.- A key part of the approach is training the selection module via knowledge distillation, using passage-level scores/labels from the expensive scoring module like BERT. - Evaluations on TREC DL 2019 and MSMARCO datasets show IDCM can match effectiveness of scoring all passages with BERT, but with over 4x lower query latency on average. IDCM also reduces variance in query times compared to BERT.- Analysis shows the selection module is able to accurately recall 60-85% of the top BERT-scored passages, especially for relevant documents. The cascade allows applying BERT to just the top 4 passages while maintaining effectiveness.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the intra-document cascade architecture and training methodology to improve efficiency and reduce variance for applying expensive models like BERT to document ranking. The cascade enables scaling to long documents while maintaining effectiveness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM) that uses a fast passage selection module and a slower but more accurate passage scoring module in a cascade to achieve state-of-the-art effectiveness for neural document ranking while greatly reducing computation cost and query latency compared to scoring all passages with the expensive module.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural document ranking:- The main contribution of this paper is proposing an intra-document cascading approach to reduce the computational cost and latency of applying large pre-trained language models like BERT to score passages for document ranking. This addresses a key challenge in scaling up neural ranking models.- The idea of using passage-level evidence for document ranking has been explored before in classical IR methods like Callan (1994) and Liu and Croft (2002). However, this paper adapts the idea specifically for reducing computational costs of neural ranking models. - The cascaded architecture is inspired by previous work on using cascades of models for document retrieval, like the seminal Viola-Jones object detection framework. However, this paper employs the idea for intra-document cascading rather than inter-document cascading over the whole collection.- Knowledge distillation has been leveraged before to transfer knowledge from larger BERT models to smaller ones. This paper employs distillation in a novel way for training the passage selection module, using BERT's passage rankings as "teacher" signals.- Compared to concurrent work like PARADE that also segments documents into passages, this paper uses a very different training strategy based on knowledge distillation rather than end-to-end joint training.- The empirical results demonstrate the intra-document cascading approach can match the effectiveness of scoring all passages with BERT, while reducing latency by over 4x. This is a significant improvement over prior work.In summary, the paper builds on prior ideas like passage-based retrieval and knowledge distillation, but combines them in an innovative way to address the efficiency challenges of neural ranking models. The resulting method achieves better effectiveness-latency tradeoffs compared to previous neural document ranking techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Extending the concept of intra-document cascading to allow for a dynamic number of passages to be selected at each stage, rather than a fixed k passages. They suggest exploring architectures with more than just two cascading stages as well.- Further exploring different training strategies and loss functions for optimizing the models at each cascade stage. This includes joint optimization techniques rather than just the staged training approach used in the paper. - Applying the intra-document cascading idea to other neural ranking models beyond just BERT, especially larger Transformer-based models that would benefit more from the efficiency gains.- Studying the behavior and effectiveness of BERT and other Transformer models when applied to ranking passages from different positions within a document (beginning, middle, end).- Validating the approach on other document ranking datasets besides just the TREC DL and MSMARCO collections used in the paper.- Investigating the efficacy of the approach for other related tasks like query-based summarization.- Exploring the cascade model for directly addressing long document inputs rather than just being applied after segmentation.So in summary, most of the suggested future work revolves around further improving, generalizing, and validating the intra-document cascading idea across different models, tasks, and datasets. The core idea seems very promising but there are many interesting research angles left to explore.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM) for neural document ranking that improves efficiency while maintaining effectiveness. The model uses a two-stage cascade within documents, first selecting passages using a fast model like CK, then scoring those passages with an expensive but effective model like BERT. They show this approach provides similar accuracy to scoring all passages with BERT, but with much lower computation cost and latency, since BERT is only applied to a small number of selected passages. The CK selection model is trained via knowledge distillation using BERT's passage scores as supervision. They evaluate on TREC DL 2019 and MSMARCO, showing IDCM matches BERT accuracy with 4x lower latency, and analyze passage selection behavior. The main contributions are proposing the cascaded ranking approach within documents, the training methodology, and demonstrating improved efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff.
