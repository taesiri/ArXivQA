# [Intra-Document Cascading: Learning to Select Passages for Neural   Document Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09816)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can an intra-document cascading model achieve comparable effectiveness to full BERT-based document ranking models while providing much lower query latency? The authors propose an Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM) that uses a less expensive model to select a small number of passages from each document, and then applies a more expensive but effective BERT model to only score those selected passages. This allows pruning away most of the passages in each document before passing to BERT scoring. The key research questions explored are:RQ1) Can IDCM match the effectiveness of scoring all passages with BERT but at lower computation cost and latency?RQ2) How does the number of passages selected by the first model influence the efficiency vs effectiveness tradeoff?RQ3) How does IDCM compare to BERT in terms of variance in query latency? RQ4) How accurately does the passage selection model recall the highest scoring BERT passages?The goal is to show IDCM can achieve similar ranking quality as BERT applied to all passages, but with much lower computational cost and query latency, as well as reduced variance in query time. The experiments aim to demonstrate this through comparison of ranking metrics, efficiency measurements, and analysis of passage selection accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM), a novel neural ranking architecture that improves effectiveness and efficiency for document retrieval. Specifically:- IDCM uses a cascade within documents, with a fast passage selection module followed by scoring with a more expensive but effective module (e.g. BERT). This allows pruning non-relevant passages before passing top ones to BERT.- A key part of the approach is training the selection module via knowledge distillation, using passage-level scores/labels from the expensive scoring module like BERT. - Evaluations on TREC DL 2019 and MSMARCO datasets show IDCM can match effectiveness of scoring all passages with BERT, but with over 4x lower query latency on average. IDCM also reduces variance in query times compared to BERT.- Analysis shows the selection module is able to accurately recall 60-85% of the top BERT-scored passages, especially for relevant documents. The cascade allows applying BERT to just the top 4 passages while maintaining effectiveness.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the intra-document cascade architecture and training methodology to improve efficiency and reduce variance for applying expensive models like BERT to document ranking. The cascade enables scaling to long documents while maintaining effectiveness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM) that uses a fast passage selection module and a slower but more accurate passage scoring module in a cascade to achieve state-of-the-art effectiveness for neural document ranking while greatly reducing computation cost and query latency compared to scoring all passages with the expensive module.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural document ranking:- The main contribution of this paper is proposing an intra-document cascading approach to reduce the computational cost and latency of applying large pre-trained language models like BERT to score passages for document ranking. This addresses a key challenge in scaling up neural ranking models.- The idea of using passage-level evidence for document ranking has been explored before in classical IR methods like Callan (1994) and Liu and Croft (2002). However, this paper adapts the idea specifically for reducing computational costs of neural ranking models. - The cascaded architecture is inspired by previous work on using cascades of models for document retrieval, like the seminal Viola-Jones object detection framework. However, this paper employs the idea for intra-document cascading rather than inter-document cascading over the whole collection.- Knowledge distillation has been leveraged before to transfer knowledge from larger BERT models to smaller ones. This paper employs distillation in a novel way for training the passage selection module, using BERT's passage rankings as "teacher" signals.- Compared to concurrent work like PARADE that also segments documents into passages, this paper uses a very different training strategy based on knowledge distillation rather than end-to-end joint training.- The empirical results demonstrate the intra-document cascading approach can match the effectiveness of scoring all passages with BERT, while reducing latency by over 4x. This is a significant improvement over prior work.In summary, the paper builds on prior ideas like passage-based retrieval and knowledge distillation, but combines them in an innovative way to address the efficiency challenges of neural ranking models. The resulting method achieves better effectiveness-latency tradeoffs compared to previous neural document ranking techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Extending the concept of intra-document cascading to allow for a dynamic number of passages to be selected at each stage, rather than a fixed k passages. They suggest exploring architectures with more than just two cascading stages as well.- Further exploring different training strategies and loss functions for optimizing the models at each cascade stage. This includes joint optimization techniques rather than just the staged training approach used in the paper. - Applying the intra-document cascading idea to other neural ranking models beyond just BERT, especially larger Transformer-based models that would benefit more from the efficiency gains.- Studying the behavior and effectiveness of BERT and other Transformer models when applied to ranking passages from different positions within a document (beginning, middle, end).- Validating the approach on other document ranking datasets besides just the TREC DL and MSMARCO collections used in the paper.- Investigating the efficacy of the approach for other related tasks like query-based summarization.- Exploring the cascade model for directly addressing long document inputs rather than just being applied after segmentation.So in summary, most of the suggested future work revolves around further improving, generalizing, and validating the intra-document cascading idea across different models, tasks, and datasets. The core idea seems very promising but there are many interesting research angles left to explore.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM) for neural document ranking that improves efficiency while maintaining effectiveness. The model uses a two-stage cascade within documents, first selecting passages using a fast model like CK, then scoring those passages with an expensive but effective model like BERT. They show this approach provides similar accuracy to scoring all passages with BERT, but with much lower computation cost and latency, since BERT is only applied to a small number of selected passages. The CK selection model is trained via knowledge distillation using BERT's passage scores as supervision. They evaluate on TREC DL 2019 and MSMARCO, showing IDCM matches BERT accuracy with 4x lower latency, and analyze passage selection behavior. The main contributions are proposing the cascaded ranking approach within documents, the training methodology, and demonstrating improved efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new neural ranking model called Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM) for document ranking. The key idea is to use a cascade of models to efficiently rank documents. The first model is a lightweight model called Efficient Student Model (ESM) which selects the top k passages from each document. The second model is an expensive but effective model called Effective Teacher Model (ETM), which only scores the k passages selected by ESM. The ETM model is typically a BERT-style model which achieves high accuracy but is slow for scoring. The authors train ESM using knowledge distillation from ETM. This allows ESM to learn to select passages that ETM would score highly. Experiments on TREC-DL 2019 and MS MARCO datasets show IDCM matches the accuracy of ranking all passages with ETM, but with over 4x lower query latency. Detailed analysis shows IDCM reduces variance in query latency by applying ETM to a fixed number of passages, rather than all passages which varies by document length. The paper demonstrates how knowledge distillation and cascading models can achieve the accuracy of expensive models like BERT at a fraction of the inference cost.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes an Intra-Document Cascading Model (IDCM) for neural document ranking that uses a two-stage cascade architecture to reduce the computational cost and latency of applying BERT to score passages from candidate documents. In the first stage, a fast and lightweight model called ESM (Efficient Student Model) selects the top k most relevant passages from the document. Then in the second stage, a slower but more effective BERT-based model called ETM (Effective Teacher Model) scores only those top k passages to produce the final document ranking score. The key to training this model is to first train the ETM on a passage ranking task, then use its passage scores as labels in a knowledge distillation process to train the ESM to mimic the passage selection that ETM would make. This allows IDCM to achieve a similar level of ranking effectiveness as scoring all passages with BERT, but at a much lower computational cost by only applying the expensive BERT inference to a small subset of passages per document.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are trying to address is the high computational cost and latency associated with applying BERT models to score all passages within a document for neural document ranking. Specifically, the paper proposes an "Intra-Document Cascading" model called IDCM to address the following key challenges:- Applying BERT to score every passage in a document is very expensive and leads to high query latency. This limits the feasibility of deploying such models in real-world retrieval systems. - The computational cost and latency of scoring all passages with BERT varies based on the length of the document, with longer documents requiring more time and computation.To address these issues, the IDCM model employs a cascaded ranking architecture within documents, with two main components:1) A fast and lightweight passage selection model called ESM that prunes non-relevant passages from a document.2) A slower but more effective scoring model called ETM (based on BERT) that is only applied on the top k passages selected by ESM.By pruning passages using ESM before running ETM, IDCM aims to achieve comparable effectiveness to directly applying ETM on all passages, but with much lower computational cost and latency that does not vary as much with document length.The key research questions addressed in the paper relate to:- Evaluating whether IDCM can match the effectiveness of ETM while providing lower latency (RQ1).- Studying the efficiency vs effectiveness tradeoff for different values of k, the number of passages selected by ESM (RQ2). - Analyzing the impact on query latency variance (RQ3).- Validating the passage selection accuracy of ESM compared to ETM (RQ4).In summary, the paper presents a strategy to enable faster and more robust deployment of BERT models for neural document ranking by pruning passages using a cascade.
