# [Empowering Cross-lingual Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with   Typological Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05454)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How do typological differences between languages impact the ability of NLP models to generalize cross-lingually?

In particular, the paper proposes a new framework called M2C for generating behavioral tests to systematically probe models' capabilities with respect to specific linguistic features across diverse languages. The goal is to shed light on where models struggle to generalize due to typological variation.

The key hypothesis is that while recent large language models can achieve good performance on many English-centric benchmarks, they will struggle on tests targeting language-specific morphological and syntactic phenomena, especially in low-resource languages. The experiments aim to highlight such "blind spots" in current models.

In summary, the central research question is understanding the challenges posed by linguistic diversity for cross-lingual NLP, and the hypothesis is that typological differences are a key factor limiting generalization even for the latest models. The M2C framework enables targeted testing of this hypothesis across languages and linguistic phenomena.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing M2C, a morphologically-aware framework for behavioral testing of NLP models in diverse languages. The key ideas are:

- Creating a framework that allows generating tests involving morphology for capabilities and typological features in multiple languages. 

- Designing tests that probe model understanding of general linguistic phenomena like negation, numerals, spatial/temporal expressions, comparatives as well as language-specific features. 

- Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the generated tests and highlighting challenges posed by typological differences. For instance, all models struggle with time expressions in Swahili and measure words in Chinese.

- Providing insights into where current models fail to generalize across languages and where capabilities only emerge at scale. For example, reasoning with negation is difficult for smaller models.

In summary, the main contribution is using targeted behavioral tests to shed light on multilingual model capabilities and limitations with respect to diverse linguistic phenomena and typological features.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding, the key points of the paper are:

1. The authors propose M2C, a new framework for generating behavioral tests to evaluate NLP models' capabilities across languages. 

2. M2C allows generating tests probing specific linguistic features like negation, numerals, spatial expressions, etc. in a diverse set of languages.

3. Using M2C, the authors evaluate state-of-the-art language models and highlight challenges posed by typological differences, e.g. models struggle with time expressions in Swahili. 

4. The findings motivate developing models that can better handle diversity in linguistic features relevant for real-world NLP applications.

To summarize, the paper introduces a new framework for targeted cross-lingual evaluation of NLP models using tests of linguistic capabilities and finds existing models still struggle with key differences.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new framework called Multilingual Morphological Checklist (M2C) for behavioral testing of natural language processing (NLP) models across different languages. Here are some key ways it compares to related work:

- Focus on typological differences: The paper highlights the importance of evaluating how models generalize to typological differences across languages. Many prior works focused only on English or evaluated models at a coarse language level rather than specific linguistic capabilities.

- Morphologically-aware framework: M2C incorporates morphology and can generate tests in languages with rich morphology. This is novel compared to prior behavioral testing frameworks like CheckList that were designed for English.

- Practical capabilities: The tests probe capabilities like negation, numerals, and comparatives that are practically relevant for real-world NLP applications. Some prior work probed narrow syntactic biases that may not matter as much for applications.

- Multilingual: Tests are generated in 12 diverse languages. Previous behavioral testing of large models mostly centered on English. Some work translated English tests but struggled with morphological variation.

- Zero-shot evaluation: Models are evaluated in a zero-shot QA setting without fine-tuning. This purely tests a model's capabilities, unlike benchmarks requiring training.

- Highlight model limitations: The paper sheds light on specific generalization failures regarding linguistic features like time expressions in Swahili. This level of analysis was lacking in prior broad benchmark evaluations.

Overall, the key novelties are the focus on typology, incorporating morphology, targeting practical capabilities, and rigorously evaluating models' abilities to generalize zero-shot in a multilingual setting. The findings motivate developing models that are robust to linguistic variation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several directions for future work:

- Automating template creation and improving morphological inflection models to make evaluation more convenient and scalable. They mention integrating models in the loop for template creation and using semi-automated generation with manual inspection to improve productivity and cost.

- Creating a larger and more comprehensive set of templates and arguments to ensure full coverage of capabilities and linguistic phenomena. 

- Extending the framework to even more typologically diverse languages to probe new challenges.

- Using the framework to shed light on other relevant linguistic capabilities not covered in the current work, such as tone, evidentiality, word order, and numeral systems.

- Developing models that address the highlighted challenges and blind spots regarding generalization to diverse typological features and morphological phenomena. The authors motivate further research explicitly focused on these issues.

- Evaluating the impact of cross-lingual transfer, multilingual pretraining, and typologically-informed model architectures.

In summary, the main suggestions are around scaling up template creation, expanding language coverage, probing additional linguistic phenomena, and using the framework to motivate and evaluate progress on models that generalize robustly to typological diversity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes M2C, a new morphologically-aware multilingual behavioral testing framework for evaluating natural language processing models. M2C allows for the generation of tests covering specific capabilities and typological features across diverse languages. The authors design tests probing model understanding of general linguistic phenomena like negation, numerals, spatial expressions, temporal expressions, and comparatives as well as language-specific features like time expressions in Swahili, possessive suffixes in Finnish, and motion verbs in Russian. They evaluate several state-of-the-art language models including mT5, PaLM, and PaLM 2 on the generated tests in 12 languages in zero-shot and one-shot settings. The results show that while large models achieve high performance on many English tests, they still struggle on certain typological features like numerals across languages and language-specific features like time in Swahili. Even huge models make non-trivial morphological errors highlighting difficulties in generating correct language-specific inflections. The findings motivate developing models that are robust to diverse linguistic phenomena and typological differences. Overall, the work introduces a new testing methodology to systematically evaluate multilingual model capabilities and provides insights into current model limitations regarding typological generalization.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes M2C, a morphologically-aware framework for behavioral testing of NLP models across diverse languages. M2C allows users to create templates with placeholders for morphological features that can generate thousands of test cases to evaluate models on specific linguistic capabilities. The authors use M2C to design tests probing model understanding of general capabilities like negation, numerals, and comparatives as well as language-specific features in 12 typologically diverse languages. 

The paper evaluates several state-of-the-art language models on the generated tests in zero-shot and one-shot settings. The results show that while the largest models excel on most English tests, they still struggle with certain capabilities in other languages, especially numerals, comparatives, and language-specific features like time expressions in Swahili. Overall, the findings shed light on continued challenges posed by typological differences in multilingual NLP and motivate developing models that address these limitations. The publicly available M2C framework enables targeted testing to uncover model weaknesses regarding diverse linguistic phenomena.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes M2C, a morphologically-aware framework for behavioral testing of NLP models across diverse languages. M2C allows for the creation of templates that include morphological placeholders to generate tests probing models' capabilities regarding specific linguistic features. The user provides a template string, values for each placeholder, and optional configuration for duplicate placeholders. Placeholders can include morphological features based on the UniMorph schema which are used to generate inflected forms. Tests are formulated as question answering prompts with a context, question, and answer. M2C provides functionality to match a range of possible outputs based on morphology and string matching. The authors use M2C to create tests covering general capabilities like negation, numerals, spatial expressions, temporals, and comparatives as well as language-specific features in 12 languages. They evaluate several state-of-the-art models on the generated tests in zero-shot and one-shot settings to analyze their abilities to generalize to diverse linguistic phenomena.
