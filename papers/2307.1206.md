# [Confidence Ranking for CTR Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1206)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:How can we train a model to perform better than the currently deployed online model in a real-world machine learning application like ads and recommendation systems? The key hypotheses are:- Modeling the prediction confidence distribution of the currently deployed online model can help train a better model.- Designing the optimization objective as a ranking function between two models (base and retrained) rather than just minimizing cross-entropy loss can improve model performance.- A ranking-based loss function that optimizes the logits output for different convex surrogate functions of metrics like AUC and accuracy can outperform cross-entropy loss.So in summary, the main question is how to train a model that outperforms the currently deployed online model, with hypotheses around using the online model predictions and a ranking-based loss function. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a novel framework called "Confidence Ranking" to optimize the loss function as a ranking function between two models (a base model and a retrained model) for CTR prediction. This allows directly optimizing the logits output for different convex surrogate functions of metrics like AUC and Accuracy.- Introducing two loss functions - point-wise CR loss and relational CR loss - that are based on ranking the outputs of the base and retrained models. These losses aim to maximize metrics like accuracy and AUC respectively. - Showing through experiments on public and industrial CTR prediction datasets that the proposed confidence ranking framework outperforms baselines like standard cross-entropy training and knowledge distillation methods.- Deploying the proposed methods in a real-world ads system for CTR prediction and demonstrating 1.75% CTR gain on average in online A/B tests.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel way to optimize CTR prediction models to perform better than the online deployed models by framing the objective as a ranking between model outputs rather than a typical cross-entropy loss. The confidence ranking framework and associated loss functions are shown to improve CTR prediction performance.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper on Confidence Ranking for CTR Prediction compares to other related work:- The problem being addressed - improving CTR prediction for ads/recommendations - is a very common one in industry. The authors motivate the need for adaptively updating models in real-world systems. This problem setup is similar to much prior work.- The key idea of optimizing a ranking loss between the new model and old model is novel. Most prior work focuses on distillation losses to transfer knowledge from older to newer models. The confidence ranking loss provides a more direct way to ensure the new model improves on the old.- The theoretical analysis providing bias-variance bounds for confidence ranking loss is a useful contribution. This helps justify why directly optimizing for improvement over the teacher can be better than just mimicking the teacher's outputs.- The experiments on public and proprietary industry datasets demonstrate sizable gains in AUC and offline metrics from using confidence ranking. The online A/B tests showing 1.75% CTR lifts confirm the real-world impact.- Using confidence ranking with different base models (DNN, DeepFM etc) and different surrogate losses for AUC vs Accuracy makes the approach broadly applicable. The simplicity of the method is also a plus.Overall, this paper introduces a simple but effective idea of directly optimizing for improvement over a baseline model. The results demonstrate clear benefits versus common practices like distillation. The theoretical analysis provides justification, and the real-world deployment proves its practical utility. This looks like a solid contribution to the CTR prediction literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Investigating more theoretical analysis and bounds for the confidence ranking loss framework, especially for complex deep learning models. The authors provided some initial theoretical motivation and analysis, but note more comprehensive bounds require specifying necessary conditions.- Exploring different choices of scoring functions beyond logistic loss for the confidence ranking objectives. The authors mainly focused on logistic loss but note other strictly proper scoring functions could be used.- Applying the confidence ranking framework to other tasks beyond CTR prediction, such as ranking, regression, etc. The current work was focused on classification for CTR prediction.- Considering different choices for constructing the positive and negative sample pairs in the relational confidence ranking loss. The authors just used all possible pairs in a mini-batch but suggest exploring heuristics for harder negative mining. - Evaluating the impact of the confidence ranking objectives under different amounts of shift between the training and serving distributions. The work assumed relatively stable distributions but significant shift could impact the benefits.- Combining the confidence ranking approach with other methods like self-correction to further push performance. The authors note combining confidence ranking with state-of-the-art techniques is an interesting direction.- Testing the confidence ranking framework on a broader range of model architectures. The current work focused on relatively simple models like DeepFM.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel framework called Confidence Ranking to improve the performance of click-through rate (CTR) prediction models in real-world systems. The framework addresses the common issues of model evolution and constant data availability in large-scale machine learning applications like ads and recommendation systems. Typically these systems periodically retrain with all available data and online-learn with recent data to adapt the models. However, different training manners induced by model and data evolution can negatively impact performance when deployed. The Confidence Ranking framework optimizes the model by maximizing the ranking score between the new model and previously deployed online model. This allows directly optimizing logits output for different convex surrogate functions of metrics like AUC and accuracy. Experiments on public and industrial datasets show the Confidence Ranking loss outperforms baselines like knowledge distillation on CTR prediction. The method improves state-of-the-art performance and has been deployed in JD.com's ad system for the fine-rank stage, with online A/B tests showing 1.75% CTR improvement on average.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel framework called Confidence Ranking to optimize the loss function for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. The key idea is to design the optimization objective as a ranking function between two models - the base model and the retrained model. Specifically, the confidence ranking loss allows directly optimizing the logits output to maximize the surrogate metric score (e.g. AUC, accuracy) relative to the base model. There are two types of confidence ranking losses proposed:1) Point-wise CR loss that ranks the outputs of the current and base models for improving accuracy. 2) Relational CR loss that optimizes the relative distance between positive and negative samples from the two models to improve AUC.During training, these confidence ranking losses can be combined with task-specific losses like cross-entropy. Experiments on public and industrial CTR datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms baselines and knowledge distillation methods. The method has also been deployed in a real-world ad system.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of how to train a model to perform better than an already deployed online model in real-world click-through rate (CTR) prediction systems. The key questions it aims to answer are:1. How can we train a CTR prediction model to outperform the currently deployed online model, when model and data distributions are constantly evolving? 2. How can we optimize the model training process to directly improve the model's performance on key evaluation metrics like AUC and accuracy?The authors motivate this problem by describing the typical machine learning pipeline in real-world systems - models are periodically retrained on new data to adapt to distribution shifts, but often fail to outperform the online model. They propose a new "confidence ranking" loss framework to address this.So in summary, the key focus is improving CTR model performance in real-world systems where models and data are non-stationary, by better utilizing the online model's predictions during training.
