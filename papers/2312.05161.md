# [TriHuman : A Real-time and Controllable Tri-plane Representation for   Detailed Human Geometry and Appearance Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05161)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key aspects of the paper:

This paper introduces TriHuman, a novel method for real-time synthesis of photorealistic and geometrically detailed virtual humans solely from multi-view video input. TriHuman represents the human geometry and appearance using an undeformed tri-plane space (UTTS) conditioned on skeletal pose, enabling efficient synthesis while avoiding ambiguities in mapping from global space points onto the triplanes. Specifically, one triplane represents the 2D UV map of the deformable human model surface, while the other two planes are orthogonal cross-sections. A non-rigid canonicalization function maps global points to UTTS, reducing triplane collisions. To enable motion-dependent triplane features, 2D motion textures encoding surface dynamics are passed through a 3D-aware convolutional architecture and decoded to geometry and color fields using shallow MLPs. TriHuman is supervised only on multi-view imagery and supports generating high quality renderings and time-coherent mesh sequences in real time for both seen and novel views and motions. Experiments on a novel benchmark dataset with challenging motions show that TriHuman achieves state-of-the-art photorealism and geometric accuracy compared to prior real-time and offline approaches. A viewer application built on TriHuman enables interactive high-fidelity avatar editing and rendering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

TriHuman proposes a novel real-time human representation using an efficient pose-conditioned tri-plane network that achieves state-of-the-art pose-controllable geometry synthesis and photorealistic rendering quality for digital human modeling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel real-time method called TriHuman for controllable and photorealistic synthesis of human models. Specifically, TriHuman introduces an efficient tri-plane representation that achieves superior performance in terms of high-fidelity geometry reconstruction and rendering quality while enabling real-time performance. The key aspects of TriHuman include:

1) A deformable and pose-dependent tri-plane representation that captures detailed geometry and appearance changes conditioned on skeletal motion. This representation enables real-time performance during rendering and geometry recovery.

2) An undeformed tri-plane texture space (UTTS) mapping that transforms global points into a canonical space, reducing ambiguities when projecting onto the tri-planes. 

3) A skeletal motion-dependent tri-plane network architecture that encodes surface dynamics into the texture space and decodes motion-conditioned features using 3D-aware convolutions.

4) A new benchmark dataset of dense multi-view video captures of humans performing various motions, along with skeletal poses, segmentations, and 4D ground truth reconstructions.

In summary, TriHuman pushes the state-of-the-art in controllable and photorealistic human rendering with superior quality and real-time performance enabled by the novel tri-plane formulation. The method and dataset aim to serve as a robust foundation for future research on digital human modeling.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Creating photorealistic and geometrically detailed digital humans that can be controlled and synthesized in real-time is very challenging. Prior methods either lack details, realism or are too slow for real-time applications.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel method called TriHuman that enables real-time, high-quality and controllable synthesis of human appearance and geometry. The key ideas are:

1) Represent the human surface with a Signed Distance Function (SDF) and color field parameterized efficiently using a tri-planar representation consisting of 3 orthogonal planes. 

2) Introduce an "undeformed tri-plane texture space (UTTS)" mapping that transforms points from global space into a texture space of the human surface to greatly reduce ambiguities when projecting points onto the tri-planes.

3) A skeletal motion conditioning scheme that encodes surface dynamics of a deformable human model into 2D motion textures, and decodes them into the tri-plane features using a 3D-aware convolutional network architecture. This allows the tri-planes to effectively encode skeletal motion.

4) Volumetric rendering of the SDF and color fields to generate photorealistic pixel colors and high-quality meshes.


Main Contributions:

- A real-time capable and controllable human avatar representation that supports skeletal motion-dependent geometry and appearance changes for loose clothing.

- An UTTS mapping strategy that reduces ambiguities when transforming global points to tri-plane texture space coordinates.

- A skeletal motion conditioning scheme for tri-planes using surface dynamics encoding and 3D-aware convolutions.

- A large multi-view dataset of humans in clothing captured from 120 cameras with more pose variation, camera views and 4D ground truth than prior benchmarks.

The method is shown to outperform previous real-time and offline methods qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of geometry quality, pose-dependence and image realism.
