# [TriHuman : A Real-time and Controllable Tri-plane Representation for   Detailed Human Geometry and Appearance Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05161)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key aspects of the paper:

This paper introduces TriHuman, a novel method for real-time synthesis of photorealistic and geometrically detailed virtual humans solely from multi-view video input. TriHuman represents the human geometry and appearance using an undeformed tri-plane space (UTTS) conditioned on skeletal pose, enabling efficient synthesis while avoiding ambiguities in mapping from global space points onto the triplanes. Specifically, one triplane represents the 2D UV map of the deformable human model surface, while the other two planes are orthogonal cross-sections. A non-rigid canonicalization function maps global points to UTTS, reducing triplane collisions. To enable motion-dependent triplane features, 2D motion textures encoding surface dynamics are passed through a 3D-aware convolutional architecture and decoded to geometry and color fields using shallow MLPs. TriHuman is supervised only on multi-view imagery and supports generating high quality renderings and time-coherent mesh sequences in real time for both seen and novel views and motions. Experiments on a novel benchmark dataset with challenging motions show that TriHuman achieves state-of-the-art photorealism and geometric accuracy compared to prior real-time and offline approaches. A viewer application built on TriHuman enables interactive high-fidelity avatar editing and rendering.
