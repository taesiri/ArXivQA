# [DeepFidelity: Perceptual Forgery Fidelity Assessment for Deepfake   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deepfakes refer to artificially generated or manipulated face images/videos that can lead to serious security issues. Detecting deepfakes is challenging due to the complexity and variability of forgery techniques.
- Existing methods focus on designing sophisticated networks to extract features but ignore the influence of perceptual quality of faces. Low quality faces (blur, occlusion) lose some forgery clues, posing difficulty for models. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose DeepFidelity framework that improves model's capability to handle complex samples by mapping real and fake faces of different qualities to distinct scores, allowing more comprehensive and fairer differentiation.

- Design SSAAFormer network:
   - Leverages symmetry of faces to model geographic long-distance relationship at shallow layers to augment local features
   - Employs self-attention at deep layers to model global dependencies between tokens
   - Maps extracted features to scores using Support Vector Regression

Main Contributions:
- Map real and fake faces of varying qualities to different scores for finer-grained differentiation ability
- Design SSAAFormer that leverages inherent symmetry in faces to promote more effective facial representation learning
- Experimentations on FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF and WildDeepfake datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods

In summary, the key novelty is the concept of perceptual forgery fidelity that scores real and fake faces based on quality to better distinguish complex samples. The SSAAFormer network further facilitates facial representation learning by exploiting geographic long-distance relationships in faces. Evaluations validate the effectiveness of DeepFidelity framework.
