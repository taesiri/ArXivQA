# [zkFDL: An efficient and privacy-preserving decentralized federated   learning with zero knowledge proof](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04579)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional centralized federated learning (FL) systems suffer from issues like lack of transparency in the aggregation process and inability to verify if the server uses all client models correctly. 
- Decentralized FL systems using blockchains have high gas costs and scalability issues for large models. They also do not properly preserve privacy of client models.

Proposed Solution:
- A decentralized FL system using a trusted central server for aggregation and zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) for verification (called zkDFL).
- Clients train local models on their data and submit to the server. 
- Server aggregates the models using the FedAvg algorithm.
- Server generates ZKP to prove correctness of:
   - Aggregation algorithm
   - Usage of models from all selected clients
- Clients verify the proofs on-chain using smart contracts. Their model parameters are hashed so privacy is maintained.

Main Contributions:
- Ensures integrity of aggregation process on trusted server using ZKP
- Allows decentralized verification of correctness by clients via smart contracts
- Preserves privacy of client models using hashes
- Reduces gas costs significantly compared to decentralized FL 
- Enables large model support unlike other blockchain FL systems
- Achieves verifiability and privacy along with central server scalability

The system was evaluated on an IoT dataset for a multi-layer perceptron model with varying complexity. Results show high accuracy (up to 98%) and significantly lower gas costs compared to decentralized FL. The tradeoffs like proof generation overhead and memory requirements are reasonable.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a decentralized federated learning framework that uses a trusted central server to aggregate client models, and leverages zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain smart contracts to verify the correctness and integrity of the aggregation while preserving client data privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) Proposing a decentralized federated learning framework that uses a trusted central server to perform aggregation of client models. The server uses a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithm to prove to the clients that the aggregation was done correctly according to the claimed algorithm.

2) Using hashes of client models as public data instead of the actual models, in order to preserve privacy. The server proves it has used all client data by showing the sum of input hashes matches what clients submit to a smart contract. 

3) Allowing clients to verify the validity of the overall process by calling deployed smart contracts to check the hash sums and verify the ZKP proof.

4) Evaluating the framework and showing it can significantly reduce gas costs compared to traditional decentralized federated learning that performs aggregation on-chain, especially for more complex models. The ZKP approach also scales better as model complexity increases.

In summary, the main contribution is a decentralized federated learning system that uses ZKP and smart contracts to provide verifiability and privacy while improving efficiency over prior decentralized approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Federated learning (FL)
- Decentralized federated learning (DFL)
- Blockchain 
- Smart contracts
- Zero knowledge proof (ZKP)
- zkSNARK
- Aggregator algorithm

The paper proposes a decentralized federated learning framework called "zkDFL" that utilizes blockchain and zero knowledge proofs to ensure the integrity and privacy of the federated learning process. Key aspects include proving the correctness of the FedAvg aggregation algorithm using ZKP, using smart contracts to verify the proofs, and scaling up the system to handle large models while preserving privacy. So keywords like federated learning, blockchain, zero knowledge proofs, aggregation, verifiability, and privacy preservation are very relevant to summarizing the contributions of this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a trusted setup to generate the common reference string (CRS) needed for the zero knowledge proof system. What are some of the security risks associated with a compromised trusted setup, and how can they be mitigated?

2. The paper utilizes the Groth16 zkSNARK for generating proofs. What are some of the limitations of this proof system, and how can alternate proof systems like bulletproofs potentially improve efficiency? 

3. The paper uses MiMC hash function for hiding model parameters. What modifications need to be made at the circuit level to make the proof system work with MiMC instead of a standard hash? How does use of MiMC impact proof generation time?

4. The paper demonstrates superior gas cost savings compared to a baseline decentralized federated learning approach. However, the computational overhead on the central server increases substantially with more clients and larger models. What optimizations like batching techniques or more efficient circuits can reduce server-side computation?  

5. The paper assumes all clients are honest. What mechanisms can be incorporated to detect and mitigate potential malicious clients attempting data or model poisoning attacks?

6. The paper uses a simple averaging based federated learning algorithm. How can the proof system be extended to support more complex aggregation algorithms like FedProx and handle systems with non-IID data?

7. The paper stores model hashes on-chain. Can the proof system be modified to completely avoid any on-chain storage and improve privacy further? What would be the limitations of such an approach?

8. The paper demonstrates results on a small 19-class activity recognition dataset. What practical challenges need to be addressed to make the system work for much larger real-world datasets and models?

9. The paper focuses only on the machine learning model aggregation. How can blockchain and zero knowledge proofs provide end-to-end verifiability spanning data acquisition, model training, evaluation and prediction as well?

10. The paper utilizes Ethereum blockchain for experiments. How will the performance and cost analysis change if alternate blockchains like Polygon or proof systems like STARKs are used instead?
