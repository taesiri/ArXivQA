# [Dynamic Syntax Mapping: A New Approach to Unsupervised Syntax Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior work has tried to extract syntactic structures from language models, but it's unclear if these truly represent syntactic dependencies or other linguistic phenomena. Attention distributions may encapsulate syntax but also capture things like coreference.
- Existing methods make assumptions by relying on specific syntactic annotation frameworks or requiring separate probe training.

Proposed Solution: 
- This paper introduces Dynamic Syntax Mapping (DSM), a new unsupervised dependency parsing approach focused on syntactic substitutability. 
- DSM generates sets of syntactically consistent sentences using substitutions guided by the language model. It then aggregates attention distributions across these sentences.
- This allows DSM to isolate syntactic dependencies, as substitutions preserve syntactic relations based on the quasi-Kunze substitutability property from linguistics.

Main Contributions:
- DSM outperforms previous unsupervised parsing methods, with increasing gains as more substitutions are used, confirming its effectiveness.
- Analysis shows DSM trees better match annotations that treat function words as syntactic heads.
- DSM substantially improves extraction of long-distance subject-verb dependencies across relative clauses.
- DSM boosts performance when integrated into other parsing algorithms, demonstrating adaptability.
- Findings suggest attention mechanisms robustly encapsulate syntactic knowledge, which DSM can uncover more fully than using individual sentences.
- DSM provides an interpretable window into syntactic representations within language models, without external constraints.

In summary, DSM advances unsupervised syntax parsing by targeting substitutability to better leverage language models' latent syntactic knowledge, offering new insights.
