# [Self-Explanation Prompting Improves Dialogue Understanding in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12940)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to enhance the comprehension abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 in complex, multi-turn dialogue tasks. 

Specifically, the authors identify that existing prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) focus on eliciting reasoning abilities, but are not as effective for dialogue tasks that require strong comprehension of long contextual information. 

To address this gap, the authors propose a novel "Self-Explanation" prompting strategy that guides the LLM to first explain each utterance in the dialogue before executing the task. This aims to improve the model's understanding of the conversational context.

The central hypothesis is that by mimicking human self-explanation, this prompting approach will boost LLM performance across a variety of dialogue tasks compared to other zero-shot prompting methods. The authors test this hypothesis through experiments on 6 dialogue datasets.

In summary, the paper centers on introducing and evaluating Self-Explanation prompting as a way to enhance LLM comprehension for complex dialogue tasks, compared to existing prompting approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel "Self-Explanation" prompting strategy to enhance the comprehension abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically:

- The paper conducts a comprehensive comparison between reasoning tasks and dialogue understanding tasks, identifying the limitations of current prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for dialogue tasks. 

- The paper introduces the "Self-Explanation" prompting strategy, which requires the model to explain each utterance in the dialogue first before completing the task. This enhances the model's contextual understanding of multi-turn dialogues.

- The proposed prompting strategy is task-agnostic and can be easily applied to different dialogue tasks.

- Extensive experiments on six dialogue datasets demonstrate that the Self-Explanation prompting consistently outperforms other zero-shot prompts and matches or exceeds few-shot prompts.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating a simple yet effective prompting strategy called Self-Explanation to significantly enhance large language models' comprehension abilities in complex multi-turn dialogue tasks, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel "Self-Explanation" prompting strategy to improve the comprehension abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on multi-turn dialogue tasks. The key idea is to prompt the LLM to first provide an explanation for each utterance in the dialogue before answering questions about the dialogue. This mimics how humans process information by explaining things to themselves. The Self-Explanation prompting is shown to consistently outperform other zero-shot prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought on six dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented dialogue, emotion recognition, and response selection. The simple yet effective prompt enhances the LLM's understanding of long, contextual dialogues and matches or exceeds the performance of few-shot prompting. Overall, Self-Explanation prompting is demonstrated to be a powerful, generalizable tool for boosting LLM comprehension on complex dialogue tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel "Self-Explanation" prompting strategy to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on multi-turn dialogue tasks. In multi-turn dialogues, comprehending long conversational contexts is crucial but challenging for LLMs. Existing prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought focus on eliciting reasoning and are ineffective for dialogues which require strong contextual understanding over reasoning. 

The proposed Self-Explanation method prompts the LLM to first explain each utterance in the multi-turn dialogue before executing the end task. This mimics how humans process large amounts of information. Experiments on six dialogue datasets show the method consistently outperforms vanilla and Chain-of-Thought prompting in zero-shot settings. It also matches or exceeds few-shot performance, demonstrating the efficacy of Self-Explanation for enhancing dialogue comprehension in LLMs without any examples.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel "Self-Explanation" prompting strategy to enhance the comprehension abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn dialogues. The key idea is to have the model provide an explanation for each utterance in a dialogue before executing the downstream task, mimicking the way humans process information. Specifically, the prompt is structured as "Context: [C]. Question: [Q]. Answer: [Explain each utterance in C and then provide A]". This requires the model to first explain every utterance, promoting deeper understanding of the dialogue context. The model can then leverage these high-level explanations to address the question. This simple yet effective prompting approach is task-agnostic and consistently outperforms other zero-shot prompts across multiple dialogue datasets. The self-explanation strategy enhances contextual comprehension without any demonstration examples or reasoning chains like in chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results reveal strong performance, matching or exceeding few-shot prompting baselines and demonstrating the efficacy of this method in boosting dialogue comprehension.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on multi-turn dialogue tasks that require strong comprehension ability, rather than just reasoning ability. 

Specifically, the authors find that existing prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting are good at eliciting reasoning skills for tasks like math word problems, but are not as effective for dialogue tasks. Dialogue tasks require more comprehension of long, multi-turn context rather than complex reasoning.

To address this issue, the authors propose a new prompting strategy called "Self-Explanation" that guides the LLM to first explain each utterance in the dialogue before answering questions about the dialogue. This enhances the model's understanding of the conversational context.

The main question addressed is how to improve LLMs' comprehension abilities on multi-turn dialogue tasks using an effective prompting strategy. The Self-Explanation method is proposed and evaluated as a way to do this.
