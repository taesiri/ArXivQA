# [Make-A-Protagonist: Generic Video Editing with An Ensemble of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08850)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper introduces Make-A-Protagonist, a framework for generic video editing using both visual and textual clues. The key research question is: how can we edit videos to change the protagonist or background using reference images and text descriptions that may not be accurately conveyed through text alone? 

The main hypothesis is that by leveraging an ensemble of pre-trained experts for video parsing, visual recognition, and generation, and proposing a novel mask-guided denoising sampling strategy, they can achieve versatile video editing without needing annotated data or training individual components.

Some key elements of their approach include:

- Using BLIP-2 for video captioning and visual question answering to extract textual clues about the protagonist. 

- Employing Grounded-SAM and XMem to detect and track the protagonist based on the textual clues.

- Encoding visual clues from reference images using CLIP and converting textual clues to image embeddings using DALL-E 2 Prior. 

- Proposing a visual-textual video generation model and mask-guided denoising sampling to combine all the information.

- Demonstrating applications like protagonist editing, background editing, and text-to-video generation with specified protagonists.

The main hypothesis is that by strategically combining multiple pre-trained experts, they can achieve robust video editing without needing annotated training data. The results validate their approach and show it enables versatile editing capabilities beyond previous text-only or single visual clue methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a generic video editing framework called Make-A-Protagonist that can edit videos using both visual and textual clues. Specifically:

- It introduces a visual-textual-based video generation model and a mask-guided denoising sampling strategy to combine multiple pre-trained experts for video editing without requiring new annotations or training data. 

- It enables editing the protagonist and/or background of a video using visual clues (reference images) and/or textual clues (text descriptions). This allows editing content that is difficult to describe accurately through text alone.

- It supports versatile video editing applications including protagonist editing, background editing, and text-to-video generation with a specified protagonist.

- It demonstrates strong qualitative and quantitative results on these applications compared to previous text-based editing, video variation, and personalized video generation methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the first framework, Make-A-Protagonist, for generic video editing using both visual and textual clues by creatively combining multiple pre-trained models as experts. This provides new capabilities for video editing and generation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other related research in video editing and generation:

- The main novelty of this paper is the ability to edit both the protagonist and background in a video using both visual and textual clues. Most prior work focuses on editing/generating videos using only text prompts or using a single visual example as reference. This allows for more fine-grained control.

- The approach uses an ensemble of pre-trained models (e.g. BLIP, CLIP, XMem, etc.) as "experts" rather than training individual components from scratch. This eliminates the need for laborious data annotation and model training for each component. 

- For generation, they propose a visual-textual video generation model based on latent diffusion models. This incorporates both textual and visual clues by fusing text embeddings and reference image embeddings. The mask-guided denoising sampling further combines this with segmentation masks from the experts.

- They demonstrate applications like protagonist replacement, background editing, and joint editing of protagonist + background. This showcases the versatility of the approach compared to more limited editing capabilities in prior work.

- A drawback is the need to invert and fine-tune the base generative model on each source video, which is computationally expensive. Approaches like DreamBooth require less per-video computation.

- There are also some limitations around overfitting to the source video and bias in the pre-trained text-to-image model. Future work could investigate mitigation strategies.

Overall, the ensemble of experts and flexible editing capabilities enabled by joint visual-textual conditioning make this an innovative approach compared to prior work in video editing and generation. The applications demonstrate more nuanced control than text-only editing methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing video editing methods that can handle more complex edits beyond just changing the protagonist or background. The authors note their method currently has limitations in handling large changes to the content and structure of the video.

- Exploring ways to reduce biases and artifacts inherited from the pre-trained models used as experts in the framework. The authors acknowledge the generated videos can reflect biases present in the foundation models.

- Improving the flexibility to edit multiple protagonists within a single video. The authors demonstrate editing two protagonists but note challenges in scaling to more complex scenes.

- Reducing the computational resources required for training and inference. The authors note their approach currently requires significant GPU resources for the training and inference process.

- Conducting further analysis to understand failure cases and limitations. The authors provide some examples where their method struggles but suggest more research is needed to fully characterize the boundaries.

- Developing interactive interfaces to make video editing more accessible to casual users. The authors focus on core technical contributions but suggest ease of use could be improved.

In summary, the main future directions relate to scaling the capabilities, reducing biases, improving efficiency, understanding limitations, and translating the technology to real-world use cases. The authors lay out an initial framework for generic video editing but there remain many opportunities for future work in this direction.
