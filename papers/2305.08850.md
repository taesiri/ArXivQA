# [Make-A-Protagonist: Generic Video Editing with An Ensemble of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08850)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces Make-A-Protagonist, a framework for generic video editing using both visual and textual clues. The key research question is: how can we edit videos to change the protagonist or background using reference images and text descriptions that may not be accurately conveyed through text alone? The main hypothesis is that by leveraging an ensemble of pre-trained experts for video parsing, visual recognition, and generation, and proposing a novel mask-guided denoising sampling strategy, they can achieve versatile video editing without needing annotated data or training individual components.Some key elements of their approach include:- Using BLIP-2 for video captioning and visual question answering to extract textual clues about the protagonist. - Employing Grounded-SAM and XMem to detect and track the protagonist based on the textual clues.- Encoding visual clues from reference images using CLIP and converting textual clues to image embeddings using DALL-E 2 Prior. - Proposing a visual-textual video generation model and mask-guided denoising sampling to combine all the information.- Demonstrating applications like protagonist editing, background editing, and text-to-video generation with specified protagonists.The main hypothesis is that by strategically combining multiple pre-trained experts, they can achieve robust video editing without needing annotated training data. The results validate their approach and show it enables versatile editing capabilities beyond previous text-only or single visual clue methods.
