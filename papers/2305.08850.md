# [Make-A-Protagonist: Generic Video Editing with An Ensemble of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08850)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces Make-A-Protagonist, a framework for generic video editing using both visual and textual clues. The key research question is: how can we edit videos to change the protagonist or background using reference images and text descriptions that may not be accurately conveyed through text alone? The main hypothesis is that by leveraging an ensemble of pre-trained experts for video parsing, visual recognition, and generation, and proposing a novel mask-guided denoising sampling strategy, they can achieve versatile video editing without needing annotated data or training individual components.Some key elements of their approach include:- Using BLIP-2 for video captioning and visual question answering to extract textual clues about the protagonist. - Employing Grounded-SAM and XMem to detect and track the protagonist based on the textual clues.- Encoding visual clues from reference images using CLIP and converting textual clues to image embeddings using DALL-E 2 Prior. - Proposing a visual-textual video generation model and mask-guided denoising sampling to combine all the information.- Demonstrating applications like protagonist editing, background editing, and text-to-video generation with specified protagonists.The main hypothesis is that by strategically combining multiple pre-trained experts, they can achieve robust video editing without needing annotated training data. The results validate their approach and show it enables versatile editing capabilities beyond previous text-only or single visual clue methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a generic video editing framework called Make-A-Protagonist that can edit videos using both visual and textual clues. Specifically:- It introduces a visual-textual-based video generation model and a mask-guided denoising sampling strategy to combine multiple pre-trained experts for video editing without requiring new annotations or training data. - It enables editing the protagonist and/or background of a video using visual clues (reference images) and/or textual clues (text descriptions). This allows editing content that is difficult to describe accurately through text alone.- It supports versatile video editing applications including protagonist editing, background editing, and text-to-video generation with a specified protagonist.- It demonstrates strong qualitative and quantitative results on these applications compared to previous text-based editing, video variation, and personalized video generation methods.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the first framework, Make-A-Protagonist, for generic video editing using both visual and textual clues by creatively combining multiple pre-trained models as experts. This provides new capabilities for video editing and generation.
