# [Is Inverse Reinforcement Learning Harder than Standard Reinforcement   Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00054)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to recover reward functions from expert demonstrations. It has many applications but lacks theoretical understanding compared to standard RL.  
- Main challenges in IRL theory: non-uniqueness of rewards, lack of results in standard offline/online RL settings, suitable metric to measure accuracy.

Proposed Solutions:
- Propose new metrics based on difference in value functions that capture policy behavior comprehensively. Relate metrics to prior work.
- Design an offline IRL algorithm, Reward Learning with Pessimism (RLP), that learns rewards from pre-collected offline dataset. Achieve sample complexity Õ(C*H^4S^2/ε^2) that depends on a concentrability coefficient C*.
- Design an online IRL algorithm, Reward Learning with Exploration (RLE), that actively explores the MDP while querying the expert. Achieve sample complexity Õ(H^4S^2A/ε^2) for general online setting.

Main Contributions:
- First polynomial sample and computational complexity guarantees for IRL in standard offline and online settings. Metrics fully capture policy behavior.
- Algorithms are nearly optimal as shown via lower bounds in both settings.
- Additional results: transfer learning to new MDP with similarity assumptions, application to IRL transfer learning.

In summary, this paper provides the first efficient and near optimal algorithms for offline and online IRL with theoretical guarantees. The settings and metrics considered are natural and capture real-world constraints. The findings significantly advance the theoretical understanding of IRL.
