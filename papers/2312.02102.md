# [Mitigating Data Injection Attacks on Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02102)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel technique to detect and mitigate data injection attacks on federated learning systems. The authors consider a scenario where some malicious participants (agents) inject false data to manipulate the global model being trained collaboratively. To address this, they present a method where the coordinating node evaluates the gradient updates from agents, compares them to the median gradient, and ignores updates from suspicious agents. Specifically, an agent is deemed suspicious if its gradient significantly deviates from the median over a time window. By considering the history of detections, they overcome potential false alarms or misses. They prove that with high probability, their scheme will detect all attackers after a finite time, while not excluding any truthful agents, assuming independent data across agents and a majority of truthful agents. Through simulations on MNIST, they demonstrate that their method can effectively detect two types of realistic attacks - constant output and label flipping attacks - even when attackers try to disguise the attack by mixing in truthful responses. Their approach allows detecting and recovering from attacks along the training process rather than just at convergence.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel technique to detect and mitigate data injection attacks on federated learning systems by evaluating the gradient updates from agents, comparing them to the coordinatewise median, and ignoring suspicious agents while probabilistically guaranteeing convergence to the true model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel technique to detect and mitigate data injection attacks on federated learning systems. Specifically:

- They present a method to detect malicious agents in a federated learning system by evaluating the gradient of the model updates from agents, comparing it to the coordinatewise median, and ignoring updates from suspicious agents. 

- They prove convergence to a truthful model with probability 1 under the assumption that data is i.i.d. among agents, provided there is a majority of truthful agents.

- They demonstrate through simulations that their proposed technique can overcome constant output attacks and label flipping attacks, even when these attacks are hidden with partially truthful responses.

So in summary, the key contribution is a new detection and mitigation scheme for data injection attacks on federated learning that is shown theoretically and empirically to allow the learning algorithm to converge to the true model despite the presence of attackers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper assumes the majority of agents are truthful. How would the performance of the proposed method degrade if this assumption was violated? Can the method be adapted to handle scenarios where malicious agents are in the majority?

2. The paper claims convergence to the truthful model with probability 1. What are the key assumptions needed for this result? How would violations of these assumptions, such as non-i.i.d. data, impact the convergence guarantees? 

3. The mixing attack model assumes the attacker's mixing weight g(t) decreases monotonically over time. How would the method perform if g(t) alternated between high and low values in a unpredictable manner?

4. The paper uses a coordinated median to identify outliers. What are some alternatives that could be used instead? How would using something like coordinatewise mean impact performance?

5. The integration interval ΔT and threshold δu are preset parameters. Is there an adaptive way to set these values automatically? How sensitive is performance to the precise values chosen?  

6. Could more advanced outlier detection methods like isolation forests or autoencoders improve detection performance? What are the tradeoffs in terms of complexity?

7. The paper evaluates performance only on MNIST dataset. How would complexity of the data distribution impact effectiveness of the proposed method?

8. How does the number of attackers impact detection performance? Is there a limit on the number of attackers the method can handle?

9. The method operates by ignoring suspected attackers. Could alternative strategies like weighted combinations perform better? What are the tradeoffs?

10. How does the neural network architecture impact success of the attacks and detection capability? Would deeper or shallower networks make the task easier or harder?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning allows multiple entities to collaboratively train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. However, federated learning systems are susceptible to data injection attacks where malicious participants manipulate the training process by injecting false data, leading to suboptimal models. Detecting such attacks is challenging since the data is decentralized across devices and there is no central authority monitoring the entire data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel technique to detect and mitigate data injection attacks in federated learning systems. The key ideas are:

- The coordinating node compares the model update gradients received from the participating agents over time. Under the assumption that agents have i.i.d. data, malicious agents who inject false data will stand out in the gradient updates.

- A low-complexity metric is introduced to detect anomalies in the gradient updates. The metric computes the $\ell_\infty$ distance between an agent's update and the coordinate-wise median update from other agents. 

- Agents whose metric exceeds a threshold are deemed suspicious and their updates are ignored for a certain period. A majority vote on the history of detections for each agent determines whether an agent is blacklisted permanently or not.

- It is proven that with high probability, after a finite time, all attackers will be permanently blacklisted while all truthful agents will be whitelisted, assuming majority of agents are truthful.

Main Contributions:
- Novel method to detect data injection attacks in federated learning using coordinate-wise median of gradients
- Majority voting scheme over time to distinguish malicious and honest agents
- Theoretical guarantee that all attackers will be isolated with high probability
- Evaluations on MNIST dataset demonstrating attack detection and recovery of model performance

The scheme allows attack detection and mitigation along the course of model training without waiting for convergence. It can handle various attacks like label flipping, constant output etc. even when attacks are partially hidden.
