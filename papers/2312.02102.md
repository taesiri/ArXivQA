# [Mitigating Data Injection Attacks on Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02102)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel technique to detect and mitigate data injection attacks on federated learning systems. The authors consider a scenario where some malicious participants (agents) inject false data to manipulate the global model being trained collaboratively. To address this, they present a method where the coordinating node evaluates the gradient updates from agents, compares them to the median gradient, and ignores updates from suspicious agents. Specifically, an agent is deemed suspicious if its gradient significantly deviates from the median over a time window. By considering the history of detections, they overcome potential false alarms or misses. They prove that with high probability, their scheme will detect all attackers after a finite time, while not excluding any truthful agents, assuming independent data across agents and a majority of truthful agents. Through simulations on MNIST, they demonstrate that their method can effectively detect two types of realistic attacks - constant output and label flipping attacks - even when attackers try to disguise the attack by mixing in truthful responses. Their approach allows detecting and recovering from attacks along the training process rather than just at convergence.
