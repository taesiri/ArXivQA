# [A Variational Perspective on Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04391)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the main research question addressed in this paper is:How can we develop an efficient and flexible framework for performing inference/sampling from diffusion models for solving general inverse problems, without relying on intractable posterior score approximations?The key points are:- Prior methods like PiGDM and DPS rely on approximating the posterior score of the diffusion process conditioned on observations (e.g. $\nabla_{x_t} log p(x_t|y)$). However, this approximation is very challenging due to the nonlinear and recursive nature of the backward diffusion process. - To overcome this, the paper proposes a variational inference framework. By minimizing the KL divergence between a variational distribution $q(x_0|y)$ and the true posterior $p(x_0|y)$, the objective decomposes into a reconstruction loss and a score matching regularization term.- The regularization term resembles "regularization by denoising" (RED) and allows treating sampling as stochastic optimization with simple gradient expressions. This avoids posterior score approximations.- A weighting mechanism based on denoising SNR is proposed to balance different diffusion timesteps.- Experiments show the proposed method, termed RED-Diff, outperforms recent sampling techniques like PiGDM and DPS in terms of quality and computation.In summary, the key hypothesis is that variational inference and RED-style regularization can provide an efficient, flexible, and tunable approach for sampling from diffusion models to solve inverse problems, without relying on intractable posterior score approximations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a variational inference framework (RED-Diff) for solving inverse problems using diffusion models as priors. This is different from prior works like PiGDM and DPS that rely on approximating the intractable posterior score. 2. It establishes a connection between the proposed method and regularization by denoising (RED) framework. This allows treating sampling as stochastic optimization and enables using off-the-shelf optimizers.3. It proposes a weighting mechanism based on denoising SNR to properly tune the regularization from different diffusion steps. 4. It demonstrates through experiments on image inpainting and superresolution tasks that RED-Diff achieves better image quality and is more GPU memory efficient compared to state-of-the-art methods like PiGDM and DPS.5. It provides insights through ablation studies on tuning the optimizer parameters to tradeoff between fidelity and perceptual quality.In summary, the main contribution is a principled variational inference framework for solving inverse problems with diffusion models that avoids posterior score approximation. The connection to RED allows efficient sampling using standard optimizers. The weighting mechanism and experimental insights are other key contributions.
