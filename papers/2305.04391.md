# [A Variational Perspective on Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04391)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the main research question addressed in this paper is:How can we develop an efficient and flexible framework for performing inference/sampling from diffusion models for solving general inverse problems, without relying on intractable posterior score approximations?The key points are:- Prior methods like PiGDM and DPS rely on approximating the posterior score of the diffusion process conditioned on observations (e.g. $\nabla_{x_t} log p(x_t|y)$). However, this approximation is very challenging due to the nonlinear and recursive nature of the backward diffusion process. - To overcome this, the paper proposes a variational inference framework. By minimizing the KL divergence between a variational distribution $q(x_0|y)$ and the true posterior $p(x_0|y)$, the objective decomposes into a reconstruction loss and a score matching regularization term.- The regularization term resembles "regularization by denoising" (RED) and allows treating sampling as stochastic optimization with simple gradient expressions. This avoids posterior score approximations.- A weighting mechanism based on denoising SNR is proposed to balance different diffusion timesteps.- Experiments show the proposed method, termed RED-Diff, outperforms recent sampling techniques like PiGDM and DPS in terms of quality and computation.In summary, the key hypothesis is that variational inference and RED-style regularization can provide an efficient, flexible, and tunable approach for sampling from diffusion models to solve inverse problems, without relying on intractable posterior score approximations.
