# [Impression-CLIP: Contrastive Shape-Impression Embedding for Fonts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Fonts convey different impressions to readers through their shapes. However, the correlation between font shapes and impressions is weak and unstable because impressions are subjective. This makes it challenging to analyze the cross-modal correlation between shapes and impressions of fonts.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Impression-CLIP, a novel machine learning model based on CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), to capture the weak and unstable correlation between font shapes and impressions. 

Key ideas:
- Treat font image features and impression text features as two modalities and pull their representations closer for the same font using contrastive learning framework of CLIP.
- Push apart representations of different fonts using negative pairs in contrastive learning.  
- Share a common latent space between the two modalities to embed shapes and impressions.

Main Contributions:
- Propose Impression-CLIP to understand cross-modal correlation between shapes and impressions of fonts using CLIP framework.
- Confirm through experiments that positive and negative correlations between shapes and impressions are enhanced from their original correlations.
- Demonstrate superior performance of Impression-CLIP over state-of-the-art in impression-based font retrieval experiments.
- Show robustness of Impression-CLIP to noise and missing tags.

The key novelty is the use of contrastive learning framework of CLIP to capture the unstable and weak correlation between two subjective modalities of font shapes and impressions. Both qualitative and quantitative results validate the effectiveness of Impression-CLIP model.
