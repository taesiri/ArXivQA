# [OneNet: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting Models under Concept Drift by   Online Ensembling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time series forecasting models trained on historical data can become inconsistent when faced with concept drift, where the data distribution changes over time. 
- Online updating of models aims to address this, but most methods just focus on parameter updating rather than model selection.
- The paper shows that different models have pros and cons: cross-time models are more robust but don't use cross-variable dependencies, while cross-variable models use dependencies but are less robust.
- Neither type of model consistently outperforms the other over time due to concept drift. Relying on one single model is insufficient.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose OneNet - an online ensembling framework with two streams: a cross-time model and a cross-variable model.
- Uses a novel Online Convex Programming (OCP) block to dynamically combine the two models over time.
- OCP block has long-term weights updated by Exponentiated Gradient Descent and short-term weights learned by offline RL.  
- Decoupled training strategy prevents one model dominating and the other not being updated.

Contributions:
- Thorough investigation and comparison of model robustness under concept drift. Show variable independence improves robustness.
- Propose online ensembling idea to combine strengths of different biases rather than just parameter updating.
- Novel OCP block to incorporate both long and short term performance via EGD and offline RL.
- Empirically reduces forecasting error by over 50% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Up to 59% reduction on challenging dataset.

The key ideas are leveraging an ensemble of complementary biases that focus on different dependencies, and using a smart weighted combination to dynamically emphasize the appropriate bias over time under concept drift.
