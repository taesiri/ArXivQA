# [Evaluating Deep Networks for Detecting User Familiarity with VR from   Hand Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As virtual reality (VR) becomes more prevalent, there will be an increasing number of first-time or early-stage VR users who are unfamiliar with VR environments and interactions. Detecting a user's familiarity level with VR provides the potential for automatically delivering training to aid acclimatization and prevent users from becoming overburdened. However, there has been little prior work on automatically detecting familiarity with VR itself as an interaction medium.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors present preliminary results for detecting user familiarity with VR using hand tracking data as users interact with a virtual numeric keypad to unlock a VR door. The door unlocking task was chosen since it is familiar to users from the real world, regardless of VR experience. The movements of the dominant hand are tracked as 14 participants (7 VR familiar, 7 VR unfamiliar) enter 4 different 4-digit unlock combinations 10 times each. Sliding windows are extracted from the trajectories and used to train deep neural network classifiers (MLPs, FCNs, PCTs) to categorize users as VR familiar or not.

Key Contributions:
- First known attempt at automatically detecting familiarity with VR as an interaction medium itself using user movement data
- Highest accuracy of 88.03% obtained in classifying a held-out test set of 6 users (3 VR familiar, 3 unfamiliar) using a PCT model
- Combinations 2648 and 3197 obtain highest familiarity detection accuracies, while performance drops for 2468 and 1379, indicating potential acclimatization effects
- Results demonstrate feasibility of using VR hand movements for familiarity detection for simple yet security-relevant VR door unlock task

The summary covers the key details of the problem being addressed, the proposed learning-based solution using user hand trajectories, the best results obtained, and the relevance of familiarity detection for access-controlled VR tasks. It highlights the novel contribution of detecting familiarity with VR itself and the potential indicated by the results while also noting limitations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents preliminary results of using deep learning classifiers to automatically detect a user's familiarity with virtual reality by analyzing their hand movements as they interact with a virtual numeric keypad to unlock a door in VR.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

Presenting preliminary results of using deep classifiers to automatically detect user familiarity with VR by tracking hand movements as users interact with a virtual reality door unlock panel. The authors collected data from 14 participants, with 7 having no prior VR experience and 7 being very familiar with VR. They trained multi-layer perceptrons, fully convolutional networks, and point cloud transformers on sliding windows of the hand trajectories to classify users as familiar or not familiar with VR. They achieved best accuracy of 88.03% for detecting unfamiliarity on the "2648" door code using the Point Cloud Transformer model.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the potential to detect VR familiarity automatically using deep learning models applied to hand tracking data during a virtual door unlock task. The results indicate promise for expanding this approach to enable on-demand training or adaptation for novice VR users.

The paper presents preliminary results on using deep learning classifiers trained on hand tracking data to automatically detect a VR user's familiarity level. The specific application involves users entering passcodes via hand gestures to unlock a virtual reality door. The classifiers analyzed include MLPs, FCNs, and PCTs applied on sliding windows, and familiarity detection accuracy over 80% is achieved on some passcode combinations. So the key terms revolve around virtual reality, familiarity detection, deep learning models, hand tracking data, and the door unlock application.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Meta Quest Pro HMD for data collection. What considerations went into selecting this particular hardware platform and how might using a different HMD impact the kinds of movement data collected or the user's experience? 

2. The paper evaluated sliding window sizes from 50 to 120 frames. What criteria or insight was used to determine this range of window sizes? Would exploring larger or smaller windows provide additional useful information?

3. The paper explored MLP, FCN, and PCT architectures for the classifiers. What motivated the selection of these specific neural network architectures? Would other modern deep learning architectures like transformers potentially be beneficial to evaluate?

4. The results show decent accuracy for the 2648 and 3197 combinations but performance close to random for the other two. What factors might explain this discrepancy in accuracy between passcodes? Could the order the codes were entered play a role?

5. The paper uses a fairly small dataset of 14 participants. How might performance change with more training data? What strategies could be used to efficiently collect a larger and more diverse dataset?  

6. The paper focuses on a binary familiar/unfamiliar classification task. Would formulating this as a regression problem to predict familiarity on a continuous scale be feasible or provide additional insights? 

7. The door unlocking task involves focused interaction with the dominant hand. How might tracking and incorporating full body motion data impact familiarity prediction?

8. The paper looks at familiarity prediction on a simple virtual door unlocking task. How might the approach need to be adapted to work for more complex VR interactions?

9. The paper predicts familiarity at the start of using a new VR application. How might familiarity prediction change over the course of a longer interaction spanning multiple sessions?

10. Beyond using predicted familiarity to adapt the VR environment, what other practical applications could familiarity prediction enable to improve usability or user experience?
