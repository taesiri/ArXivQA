# [Projection-free computation of robust controllable sets with constrained   zonotopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of efficiently computing robust controllable (RC) sets for discrete-time linear systems with additive uncertainty. RC sets characterize the states that can be steered to a target set despite disturbances, constraints, and uncertainties. Exact computation of RC sets involves set projections, which becomes intractable for high-dimensional systems. The paper aims to develop tractable inner and outer approximations of RC sets using constrained zonotopes.

Proposed Solution:

1. The paper proposes a least-squares-based approach to inner- and outer-approximate the Pontryagin difference between a constrained zonotopic minuend and a symmetric, convex and compact subtrahend. 

2. For the inner-approximation, the paper derives a diagonal matrix that scales the generator matrix of the minuend zonotope. This results in a shrunk zonotope contained in the actual Pontryagin difference set. Closed-form expressions for the diagonal matrix are provided when the subtrahend is a zonotope, ellipsoid or convex union of intervals.

3. For the outer-approximation, the paper first constructs a polyhedral outer-approximation of the minuend zonotope, computes the Pontryagin difference between this outer-polyhedron and the subtrahend, and finally intersects this outer polytopic difference set with the shifted minuend zonotope.

4. Using the above inner- and outer- approximations in set recursions, the paper shows how to efficiently inner- and outer-approximate RC sets for systems with symmetric, convex and compact disturbances, and subject to polytopic/polyhedral constraints.

Main Contributions:

- Novel non-optimization based approaches for tractable approximation of RC sets using constrained zonotopes
- Closed-form inner-approximations of the Pontryagin difference between a zonotopic minuend and ellipsoidal/zonotopic/interval subtrahends  
- Demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach by approximating high-dimensional RC sets (100 dims) quickly (under 15 seconds)
- Showcased the utility of the approach for abort-safe spacecraft rendezvous problem while accounting for actuation uncertainty and constraints

In summary, the paper develops efficient algorithms for approximate computation of RC sets for uncertain, constrained systems, enabling their application to high-dimensional problems.
