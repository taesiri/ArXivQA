## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Inference-Time Rule Eraser: Distilling and Removing Bias Rules to Mitigate Bias in Deployed Models":

Problem:
Existing methods for promoting fairness in AI models typically require retraining the models with fairness constraints or fine-tuning the models. However, this is often infeasible in real-world applications where regular users have no ability to access or modify the model weights. The paper aims to address the debiasing of deployed models in such practical scenarios where only the model's output can be queried.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "Inference-Time Rule Eraser" which removes biased rules from the model output at inference-time without needing to access the model parameters. It is based on a theoretical analysis using Bayesian interpretation which shows the feasibility of eliminating the influence of biased decision rules from the model output. 

The framework involves two key stages:
1) Distill stage: Use a small labeled dataset to distill the bias rules from the deployed model into an additional "patch" model using a proposed "rule distillation learning" method. This allows the patch model to provide the bias rule response for a given input.
2) Remove stage: At inference-time, subtract the patch model's logit output (representing bias rules) from the deployed model's logit output to remove the effect of biased rules and obtain the debiased result.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretically analyzed and verified the feasibility of removing biased rules while retaining target rules from model output for debiasing, without needing access to model parameters.
- Derived a simple and effective bias rule removal framework called "Inference-Time Rule Eraser".  
- Proposed a specific implementation involving rule distillation and patch model to obtain and eliminate bias rules from deployed black-box models at inference-time.
- Demonstrated superior debiasing performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, without reducing accuracy. Highlighted broad applicability beyond fairness e.g. for removing spurious rules.

Overall, the paper introduced a flexible and practical paradigm for tackling bias issues in deployed AI systems by editing rules at inference-time through output modification.
