# [Learning Goal-Directed Object Pushing in Cluttered Scenes with   Location-Based Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17667)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenging problem of non-prehensile planar pushing of objects to desired target poses in cluttered environments. This involves reasoning about the complex interactions between the pusher, pushed object, and obstacles, while avoiding collisions. The presence of clutter makes this even more difficult by requiring spatial reasoning and reactiveness. Prior methods either do not consider obstacles or target orientations, rely on hand-crafted guidance that restricts exploration, or use predefined obstacle representations that limit adaptability.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a model-free reinforcement learning approach using proximal policy optimization with categorical action space discretization for exploration. To represent the cluttered workspace, it uses occupancy grid maps and processes them with a lightweight location-based attention module to focus on task-relevant spatial features. This enables learning without global guidance while being robust to diverse, even dynamic, obstacle configurations. The reward comprises distance- and collision-based terms, and the training incorporates dynamics randomization and synthetic noise for sim-to-real transfer.

Contributions:
1) A guidance- and model-free reinforcement learning framework combining categorical exploration and location-based attention for goal-directed pushing through clutter.

2) Extensive simulation experiments demonstrating high success rates in complex spaces with various unseen obstacle quantities, shapes and configurations. The approach can also be efficiently fine-tuned.

3) Qualitative and quantitative validation on physical hardware, showing smooth precise trajectories and ability to handle challenges like dynamic obstacles.

In summary, the paper provides an end-to-end learning solution for precise goal-oriented non-prehensile manipulation in cluttered environments that adapts effectively to diverse configurations through itsAttention and exploration mechanisms. The real-world experiments highlight the efficacy and transferability.
