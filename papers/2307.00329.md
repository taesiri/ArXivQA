# DoReMi: Grounding Language Model by Detecting and Recovering from   Plan-Execution Misalignment

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we enable immediate detection and recovery from misalignments between high-level plans generated by language models and low-level skill executions in embodied agents? The key hypothesis appears to be: By leveraging language models to generate constraints that indicate plan-execution alignment, and using a visual question answering (VQA) model to continuously monitor these constraints, we can enable timely re-planning and recovery when misalignments occur during long-horizon robotic tasks.In summary, this paper focuses on detecting and recovering from mismatches between the high-level plans created by language models and the actual low-level execution in robotic systems. The core proposal is to use language models and VQA to quickly identify these plan-execution misalignments and trigger re-planning for more effective task completion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel framework called DoReMi that enables immediate detection and recovery from misalignments between high-level plans and low-level executions in robotic tasks. 2. It leverages large language models (LLMs) for both high-level planning and generating constraints that can indicate whether the plan and execution are aligned.3. It uses a visual question answering (VQA) model during execution to periodically check if constraints are satisfied, enabling timely triggering of re-planning when misalignments occur.4. It provides theoretical analysis on how immediate re-planning can reduce wasted time and improve success rate compared to delayed re-planning. 5. It demonstrates the effectiveness of DoReMi through experiments on robot arm manipulation tasks and humanoid robot tasks under various disturbances, showing improved success rates and reduced execution times.In summary, the key innovation is the DoReMi framework that enables immediate and continuous detection of misalignments between plans made by LLMs and low-level skill executions, along with timely triggering of re-planning for recovery. This is shown to be more efficient than delayed re-planning approaches.
