# [Joint Multi-Facts Reasoning Network For Complex Temporal Question   Answering Over Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) models are limited to simple questions with a single temporal fact and explicit temporal constraints. They require knowing the subject/object annotations of entities in advance. These limitations prevent them from accurately answering complex temporal questions which contain multiple entities and facts. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Joint Multi-Facts Reasoning Network (JMFRN) to answer complex temporal questions over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). The key ideas are:

1) Retrieve multiple candidate facts from the TKG related to the entities in the question. 

2) Design an Entity-Aware Attention module and a Time-Aware Attention module to aggregate information from the multiple facts. This allows joint reasoning over the facts.

3) Introduce an auxiliary Answer Type Discrimination (ATD) task to match question and answer types.

Main Contributions:

1) Makes an effort to tackle complex temporal QA over TKGs which require joint reasoning over multiple facts.

2) Proposes the JMFRN model with two attention modules for multi-fact aggregation and joint reasoning.

3) Introduces the ATD task to improve answer accuracy and accelerate training.

4) Achieves new state-of-the-art results on the TimeQuestions benchmark, especially for complex questions with multiple entities.

In summary, the paper addresses an important limitation of existing TKGQA methods in handling complex questions. The proposed JMFRN model with attention-based multi-fact reasoning and auxiliary type matching provides an effective solution. Experiments validate its capabilities over previous models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Joint Multi-Facts Reasoning Network (JMFRN) to accurately answer complex temporal questions over temporal knowledge graphs by jointly reasoning with multiple retrieved temporal facts using entity-aware and time-aware attention mechanisms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a simple but effective TKGQA model called Joint Multi-Facts Reasoning Network (JMFRN) to handle complex temporal questions by jointly reasoning with multiple temporal facts. 

2. Designing two well-designed attentions (entity-aware and time-aware) for aggregating entities and timestamps information from multiple temporal facts to improve prediction accuracy. 

3. Introducing an additional answer type discrimination task during training to avoid irrelevant answers. Experiments show this not only improves accuracy but also accelerates and stabilizes model training.

4. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the complex temporal question benchmark TimeQuestions dataset with 0.628 Hits@1, especially on complex questions with multiple entities.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the JMFRN model to address complex temporal question answering over temporal knowledge graphs by jointly reasoning with multiple facts. The well-designed components in JMFRN enable improved performance over previous methods.
