# [CrisisKAN: Knowledge-infused and Explainable Multimodal Attention   Network for Crisis Event Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Social media is an important source of real-time information about crisis events like disasters and disease outbreaks. However, state-of-the-art models struggle to effectively classify such multimodal crisis events using images and text from social media posts. 
- Challenges include:
    - Inconsistent encoding leads to a semantic gap between image and text modalities during feature extraction and fusion.
    - Black box nature of models fails to explain outcomes to build trust.
    - Short text length introduces event biases.

Proposed Solution - CrisisKAN:
- A novel Knowledge-infused and Explainable Multimodal Attention Network

Key Components:
1. Knowledge Infusion 
    - Address event biases and limited text length by incorporating external knowledge from Wikipedia using a proposed wiki extraction algorithm.

2. Multimodal Feature Extraction
    - Image features extracted using DenseNet CNN
    - Text features extracted using Electra transformer after knowledge infusion
    
3. Guided Cross Attention Fusion
    - Align features from the two modalities and selectively aggregate valuable information
    - Self-attention provides guidance to the cross-attention module
    
4. Explainability 
    - Model-specific GradCAM method provides visual explanations about important regions in images responsible for predictions.
   
Main Contributions:  
1. Novel knowledge infusion to enhance crisis event classification
2. Guided cross attention to bridge semantic gap between modalities  
3. Integrated explainability module for transparency and trust  
4. Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CrisisMMD dataset across tasks
    - Up to 5% improvement in accuracy over best baseline

The paper addresses key limitations in multimodal crisis event classification through explainability and targeted infusion of external knowledge into the model. CrisisKAN advances the state-of-the-art by enabling more robust and trustworthy event classification.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CrisisKAN, a novel multimodal network for crisis event classification that infuses external Wikipedia knowledge into the text, uses a guided cross-attention mechanism to fuse image and text features, and incorporates explainability through Grad-CAM visualization to build trust in model predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) Proposing a novel multimodal framework called CrisisKAN for crisis event classification that infuses external knowledge from Wikipedia to enhance the contextual understanding of limited social media text.

2) Introducing a guided cross attention mechanism to effectively bridge the semantic gap between image and text modalities by filtering out irrelevant or misleading information.

3) Incorporating explainability into the model using Grad-CAM to provide visual explanations of the predictions and build trust in high-stakes crisis situations. 

4) Comprehensive experiments on the CrisisMMD dataset across various tasks and settings demonstrate superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. The authors also propose a new metric called Multi-task Model Strength (MTMS) to evaluate overall model performance across tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is a knowledge-infused and explainable multimodal network that pushes the state-of-the-art in crisis event classification by effectively fusing image and text data with external knowledge while also providing visual explanations.
