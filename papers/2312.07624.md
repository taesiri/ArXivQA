# [Adaptive Proximal Policy Optimization with Upper Confidence Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07624)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control that constrains policy updates within a surrogate trust region to ensure stability and monotonic improvement. 
- However, using a fixed clipping bound for the trust region is suboptimal as different bounds may be needed during different stages of training to balance exploration vs exploitation.
- The paper proposes dynamically changing the clipping bound in PPO to create a more adaptive trust region that can improve performance.

Methodology:
- Formulates selecting the PPO clipping bound as a bandit problem with multiple arms, where each arm corresponds to a candidate clipping bound value.
- Uses an upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy to select the clipping bound for each PPO update, balancing exploration of different bounds with exploitation of the best bounds found so far.
- The UCB value for each bound is updated over time based on the agent's performance when trained using that bound.
- This Adaptive-PPO method automatically tunes the clipping bound throughout training to improve sample efficiency.

Contributions:
- Provides analysis on the benefits of a dynamic clipping bound for PPO based on theory and the need to balance exploration/exploitation.
- Proposes the Adaptive-PPO algorithm which uses a UCB bandit approach to automatically adapt the trust region over the course of training.
- Shows improved performance over fixed clipping PPO empirically on several continuous control tasks, especially high-dimensional ones.
- The method is general and could be applied to automatically tune other key parameters in PPO or policy gradient methods.
