## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents Animal-AI 3, the latest version of a 3D game-based environment designed to facilitate research in artificial intelligence (AI) and the study of biological cognition and intelligence, especially inspired by animal cognition and behavior. 

The key idea behind Animal-AI is that AI research and cognitive science research can mutually benefit each other if done in a shared environment. Animal-AI provides a platform for this interdisciplinary collaboration. It is centered around building experiments related to spatial navigation, physical reasoning, and tool use that are inspired by research on animal cognition.

Animal-AI 3 introduces major upgrades over previous versions:

- Interactive objects like buttons and reward dispensers to build more complex experiments
- Graphical overhaul for better agent training performance and human experiment experience  
- Features like health bars and notifications to aid human subject experiments
- Easy to use configuration files to quickly construct experiments procedurally

The paper discusses Animal-AI's benefits for both AI and human cognition research in detail. On the AI side, it serves as a challenging embodied environment to train intelligent agents, while being more constrained than extremely complex platforms. For human experiments, it removes overheads like building physical apparatuses and facilitates remote data collection through web browsers.

The new interactive objects enable testing causal reasoning by requiring agents to understand consequences of their actions. Combined with an integrated battery of 900 tasks testing aspects of physical intelligence like object permanence and tool use, Animal-AI 3 remains challenging for state of the art Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. 

The paper demonstrates Animal-AI's capabilities through sample navigation, tool use and cognitive testing experiments. It implements several baseline agents, including the advanced model-based reinforcement learning algorithm Dreamer. While Dreamer and similar learning agents solve simple foraging tasks, their performance remains far below human level intelligence on complex cognition tests.

In conclusion, Animal-AI 3 provides an easy to use yet challenging testbed to develop AI with more sophisticated physical reasoning skills, while also serving as an engaging experimental platform for human studies, enabling a greater synergy between both fields.
