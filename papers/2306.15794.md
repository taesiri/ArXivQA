# [HyenaDNA: Long-Range Genomic Sequence Modeling at Single Nucleotide   Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:1. Can a convolutional long-context model be used effectively at single nucleotide resolution for genomic sequences? 2. What new capabilities could long-context genomic foundation models enable?The authors hypothesize that the Hyena architecture, which uses implicit convolutions rather than attention, can unlock the potential to capture both long-range dependencies and single nucleotide resolution in genomic sequences. This is in contrast to previous Transformer-based models in genomics that have been limited to using 512-4096 tokens as context. To test this hypothesis, the authors present HyenaDNA - a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide level. They then evaluate HyenaDNA on a diverse set of 28 downstream tasks to assess its ability to model long-range interactions while retaining fine-grained resolution.Some of the key capabilities enabled by the long context of HyenaDNA that the paper explores include:- Effective use of in-context learning to adapt the model to new tasks without updating pretrained weights- Solving a novel ultralong-range species classification challenge by leveraging 1M token contexts- Serving as an effective universal featurizer for genomic sequences by embedding sequences in a way that clusters them by biological functionSo in summary, the two main research questions relate to whether convolutional models can achieve both long-range modeling and single nucleotide resolution in genomics, and what new capabilities this might enable. The HyenaDNA model is presented as a way to test these hypotheses.
