# [Adaptive Deep Learning for Efficient Visual Pose Estimation aboard   Ultra-low-power Nano-drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15236)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Nano-drones have limited compute resources for running perception pipelines like pose estimation. Using a single static CNN wastes resources on easy frames and underperforms on complex frames.
- Prior work has not explored adaptive inference for regression problems like pose estimation. Policies from classification don't apply directly.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an adaptive system with two CNNs - a smaller fast one and a bigger accurate one. Switch between them dynamically per frame.
- Propose three novel policies to determine which CNN to use:
    1) Output-based: Compute change in pose between frames. Use big CNN if change is large.
    2) Aux-SM: Run a small auxiliary CNN for head localization. Use score margin to estimate complexity.
    3) Aux-HLC: Same as above, but use an error map to see where big CNN helps more.

Contributions:  
- First work exploring adaptive inference for visual pose estimation on nano-drones
- Proposed two model ensembles and three novel adaptation policies tailored for this task
- Show 28% latency reduction at iso-accuracy and 3% error reduction at iso-latency over static models
- Achieve new state-of-the-art result for this task, outperforming prior art

In summary, this paper introduces a novel adaptive inference system and specialized policies for efficient visual pose estimation on resource-constrained nano-drones. The system dynamically adjusts compute based on input complexity to maximize accuracy within the tiny power envelope. Both latency and error metrics are substantially improved over static models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel adaptive deep learning-based mechanism that combines two state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks with different trade-offs and three new adaptation strategies for efficient and accurate visual human pose estimation aboard resource-constrained nano-drones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing two distinct adaptive ensembles that combine three CNN models from prior work for visual human pose estimation on nano-drones. The two less accurate networks are used as "small" models and the most accurate one as the "big" model in both ensembles.

2) Introducing three novel adaptation policies based on the output's temporal consistency of pose estimation and auxiliary tasks that are tailored for this application. 

3) Demonstrating that the proposed adaptive algorithms, combining the ensembles and policies, outperform the state-of-the-art results on two datasets for this robotic task.

4) Showing that compared to static CNNs, the approach generates a broader solution space with numerous intermediate trade-off points between accuracy and complexity. For example, compared to the most accurate static model, the best adaptive system reduces the Mean Absolute Error by 3.15% at constant latency, or reduces latency by 28.03% at constant error.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing adaptive ensembles and policies for efficient visual human pose estimation on resource-constrained nano-drones, which outperform prior static models on this task.

The paper presents an adaptive deep learning-based system for efficient visual pose estimation of humans aboard resource-constrained nano-drones. The key ideas involve using an ensemble of CNN models of varying complexity that are selectively executed based on novel adaptation strategies like output-based and auxiliary task-based partitioning policies. These methods aim to reduce the latency and improve the accuracy trade-offs compared to static models. The solutions are deployed on an ultra-low-power SoC platform using optimizations like QAT and tested on real nano-drone hardware.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) What is the motivation behind using an adaptive approach for human pose estimation on nano-drones rather than a single static model? Discuss the limitations of using a static model and how the adaptive approach aims to address them.

2) Explain the two novel policies (Output-based Partitioning and Auxiliary Task-based Partitioning) proposed for managing adaptive inference. Discuss the key ideas behind each one and how they are tailored for the visual human pose estimation task. 

3) The paper combines three CNN models (F1, F2, M1.0) into two ensembles by fixing M1.0 as the big model. What is the rationale behind creating two separate ensembles rather than a single trio ensemble?

4) Analyze the tradeoffs between the Output Partitioning (OP) policy versus the Auxiliary Task-based policies (Aux-SM and Aux-HLC). Under what conditions does one policy outperform the other?

5) Discuss the process of designing the auxiliary CNN for head localization. What considerations went into pruning away filters to minimize its complexity? How was the grid size selected?

6) Explain how the error maps are constructed for the Aux-HLC policy and what insights they provide about the relative difficulty of pose estimation depending on head location. 

7) The GAP8 platform used for deployment has several memory types (L1, L2, DRAM, Flash). Explain how data movement between these memories is orchestrated during CNN inference.

8) What software tools (PLiNIO, DORY) are used to convert and deploy the trained neural network models onto the nano-drone hardware? What optimizations do they apply?

9) Analyze the results in Table 1 deployment on the Crazyflie nano-drone. Compare the adaptive policies against the static models and random baseline in terms of accuracy, latency, energy use, and memory footprint. 

10) Why does the OP policy perform poorly compared to Aux-HLC for the F1/M1.0 ensemble but works very well for F2/M1.0? Discuss the possible reasons behind this based on properties of the F1 and F2 models.
