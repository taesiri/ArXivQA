# [Edge-Enabled Anomaly Detection and Information Completion for Social   Network Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07022)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Law enforcement agencies need to analyze interpersonal relations to predict and manage public safety risks. However, analyzing complex social networks is challenging. 
- Existing methods do not fully exploit connections between relations, leading to semantic gaps. 
- Cloud-based models have privacy risks and latency issues. Edge devices have limited compute resources.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a knowledge graph of personnel information like identities, jobs, locations. 
- Use knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models like RotatE to infer missing relations and identify anomalies.
- Propose a lightweight model pruning algorithm to reduce model complexity by 70% while preserving accuracy. 
- Deploy pruned RotatE model on Jetson Nano edge device to enable real-time, private local processing.

Main Contributions:
- Build a personnel information knowledge graph with 997k triples about jobs, identities, relations.
- Evaluate 11 advanced KGE models - RotatE gives best performance for graph completion.
- Propose PDQA data quality assessment approach to detect anomalies.  
- Develop model pruning technique that cuts model size by 70% with only 2% drop in accuracy.
- Show pruned RotatE model can be effectively deployed on resource-constrained Jetson Nano edge device to analyze personnel data locally.

In summary, this paper develops a methodology to represent and infer interpersonal relations using knowledge graphs for public safety applications. The core ideas are constructing the domain graph, selecting the best inference model, compressing it and deploying it on-device to enable real-time secure processing.
