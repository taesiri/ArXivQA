## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Training deep neural networks using gradient-based methods requires computation of gradients at each layer, which necessitates large memory overhead for storing intermediate activations when using backpropagation. 
- Forward propagation for gradient computation also has high computational complexity due to large matrix-matrix products.
- Recently, the Projected Forward Gradient method was introduced as a memory-efficient alternative, but its convergence behavior when used within optimization algorithms like Frank-Wolfe (FW) has not been analyzed.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper analyzes using Projected Forward Gradient within the FW algorithm for optimizing neural network training.
- It is shown that directly using Projected Forward Gradient in FW (Algorithm 1) leads to convergence to a non-zero error neighborhood around the optimal solution.
- To achieve exact convergence, Algorithm 2 is proposed which averages across iterations of Projected Forward Gradient directions to reduce noise. 

Main Contributions:
- Rigorously proves that using Projected Forward Gradient in standard FW fails to achieve exact convergence, with error margin quantified (Theorem 1).
- Presents refined Algorithm 2 that provably converges to optimal solution at a sublinear rate by aggregating historical gradient directions (Theorem 2).
- Establishes variance reduction for averaged Projected Forward Gradient estimator (Lemma 1).
- Validates superior convergence of Algorithm 2 over Algorithm 1 numerically on MNIST dataset.
- Overall, enables reduced memory overhead for FW optimization by systematically integrating Projected Forward Gradient.

In summary, the key innovation is a convergent FW algorithm using Projected Forward Gradient that retains the memory efficiency of forward pass gradients while still achieving the optimization performance of backpropagation. The analysis and refined technique significantly advance the applicability of FW methods for memory-constrained training of deep neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm called Averaged Forward Gradient Frank-Wolfe that ensures the convergence of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to the optimal solution when using the memory-efficient Projected Forward Gradient for computing gradients, by systematically reducing the noise in the gradient estimations through historical averaging.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel optimization algorithm called Averaged Forward Gradient Frank-Wolfe (AFGFW) for efficient training of deep neural networks. The key highlights are:

1) It analyzes the performance of using the Projected Forward Gradient (PFG) method within the Frank-Wolfe optimization framework. It shows that directly using PFG leads to convergence to a non-zero error bound.

2) To address this issue, it proposes the AFGFW algorithm that averages historical PFG directions to systematically attenuate the stochastic noise in gradient estimations. 

3) It provides a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that the AFGFW algorithm achieves sublinear convergence to the optimal solution. This is in contrast to standard Frank-Wolfe with PFG which fails to achieve exact convergence.

4) It validates the convergence guarantees of the AFGFW algorithm numerically on a sparse multinomial logistic regression problem using the MNIST dataset. 

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and analysis of the AFGFW algorithm that ensures memory-efficient and exact convergence for training deep neural networks by elegantly combining ideas from PFG and Frank-Wolfe methods.
