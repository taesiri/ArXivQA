# [Plan-and-Solve Prompting: Improving Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning   by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we improve zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning by large language models through better prompting strategies?Specifically, the authors aim to address some limitations of prior zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategies:- Calculation errors in reasoning steps leading to incorrect answers- Missing reasoning steps, especially for problems with many steps  - Other semantic misunderstanding errorsTo address these issues, the central hypothesis appears to be:By introducing a simple but effective prompting strategy called "plan-and-solve" prompting, we can guide large language models to generate higher quality reasoning steps and reduce errors in zero-shot CoT reasoning.The Plan-and-Solve (PS) prompting strategy has the model first devise a plan to break down the reasoning task into subtasks, before carrying out the plan to solve the problem step-by-step. This is hypothesized to reduce missing step errors.Additionally, adding more detailed instructions to the PS prompt, such as prompting the model to extract variables and calculate intermediate results carefully, results in the PS+ variant which is hypothesized to further reduce calculation errors and improve reasoning quality.So in summary, the key research question is whether "plan-and-solve" prompting can enhance zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning by large language models, reducing common errors and improving multi-step reasoning quality without the need for demonstration examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Identifying three key issues with the Zero-shot-CoT method: calculation errors, missing reasoning step errors, and semantic misunderstanding errors. The authors provide an analysis showing the distribution of these error types.2. Proposing two new zero-shot prompting methods called Plan-and-Solve (PS) and Plan-and-Solve+ (PS+) to address the issues in Zero-shot-CoT. The key ideas are to prompt the model to first devise a plan to decompose the reasoning task before executing the plan, and adding more detailed instructions to guide the reasoning process. 3. Evaluating PS and PS+ prompting strategies on 10 datasets across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The results show PS+ consistently and significantly outperforms Zero-shot-CoT, and is comparable or better than few-shot CoT prompting on several arithmetic datasets.4. Providing analysis to gain insights, such as showing the impact of prompts, exploring plan presence, and examining the correlation between generated reasoning and error types.In summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating the proposed PS and PS+ zero-shot prompting strategies to improve reasoning and reduce specific error types compared to prior Zero-shot-CoT prompting. The results indicate these prompting strategies can elicit better reasoning from large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes a new zero-shot prompting method called Plan-and-Solve (PS) that improves reasoning and reduces errors in large language models by first prompting them to devise a plan to decompose complex reasoning tasks into subtasks before generating step-by-step reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper focuses specifically on improving chain-of-thought reasoning and multi-step problem solving abilities in large language models through prompting strategies. Other related works have explored improving reasoning abilities in LLMs through other methods like scaling model size, adding demonstrations, or using reinforcement learning. So this work provides a novel prompting-based approach.- Compared to other prompting methods like few-shot CoT or zero-shot CoT, this paper introduces the idea of having the LLM first plan out its reasoning steps before executing them. Asking the model to plan seems to substantially improve its reasoning and reduce errors. This "plan-then-solve" prompting strategy is a simple but effective novelty. - The idea of providing more detailed prompting instructions to reduce calculation errors and missing steps is also an incremental improvement over prior CoT prompting work. The analysis of how different prompts impact errors is an insightful contribution.- In terms of performance, the proposed PS+ prompting reaches state-of-the-art results for zero-shot prompting on several math reasoning datasets, outperforming prior methods like zero-shot CoT and zero-shot PoT. The fact that it can match performance of 8-shot CoT is impressive.- The experiments are thorough, testing the approach on multiple datasets across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. The analyses provide insight into the method's strengths and limitations.Overall, I would say this paper makes excellent progress on an important problem, introduces some novel and effective prompting strategies, and provides useful analysis and insights that advance the state of knowledge in training LLMs for complex reasoning. The results and techniques should be of interest to other researchers working on improving reasoning abilities in large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Explore applying the plan-and-solve prompting strategy to other complex reasoning tasks beyond math, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning problems evaluated in the paper. The prompting approach seems generalizable. - Develop new prompting strategies and formats to further improve the quality of reasoning generated by LLMs. The paper shows promise for zero-shot prompting, so more work can be done to design effective prompts.- Compare performance of plan-and-solve prompting strategy with newer LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to evaluate if the planning abilities in LLMs have improved. The paper indicates this based on their observation of plan presence in predictions.- Refine and enhance the planning phase of the prompting strategy, going beyond just high-level plan generation. The paper mentions refining the plan as an interesting future direction.- Explore the combination of plan-and-solve prompting with other CoT prompting enhancement techniques like self-consistency, prompt ensembling etc. - Develop methods to address semantic understanding errors in CoT reasoning, which still remain as an issue based on the error analysis in the paper.- Analyze the correlation of different parts of the generated text with error types in more depth to provide further insight.- Compare zero-shot plan-and-solve prompting with few-shot CoT prompting as models scale up to see if the manual effort can be eliminated.In summary, the key future directions focus on expanding the prompting strategy to new tasks, refining the planning phase, combining with other prompting techniques, addressing semantic errors, and scaling up the models to compare zero-shot vs few-shot performance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new prompting strategy called Plan-and-Solve (PS) prompting to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 in a zero-shot setting. The authors find that existing zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can still result in errors like incorrect calculations, missing reasoning steps, and semantic misunderstandings. To address this, their PS prompting first asks the LLM to devise a plan to divide the reasoning task into subtasks, and then carry out the plan step-by-step. They further improve this with PS+ prompting which adds more detailed instructions to extract key information and perform calculations correctly. Experiments on math, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning datasets show their PS+ prompting substantially outperforms zero-shot CoT prompting. It also matches or exceeds the performance of few-shot CoT prompting that requires manual demonstration examples. The results suggest zero-shot prompting with planning and constraints can elicit better reasoning from LLMs. The work provides insights into designing prompts that guide LLMs to generate high-quality reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new zero-shot prompting method called Plan-and-Solve (PS) prompting to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. The existing Zero-shot-CoT method simply appends "Let's think step by step" to prompt the LLM to generate reasoning steps. However, it still suffers from calculation errors, missing reasoning steps, and semantic misunderstanding. To address these issues, the proposed PS prompting consists of two components - devising a plan to divide the reasoning task into subtasks, and then carrying out the subtasks according to the plan. The prompts are designed to guide the LLM to pay attention to calculations, extract relevant variables, and compute intermediate results. Experiments on math, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning datasets show PS+ prompting (PS with more detailed instructions) outperforms Zero-shot-CoT across all datasets. It also exceeds few-shot CoT prompting on some datasets, indicating the potential of zero-shot methods to replace manual few-shot prompting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method called Plan-and-Solve (PS) prompting to improve reasoning by large language models (LLMs). PS prompting guides the LLM to first devise a plan to decompose the reasoning task into subtasks before carrying out the plan to solve the problem step-by-step. To further improve the quality of the generated reasoning steps, the authors extend PS prompting to PS+ prompting by adding more detailed instructions such as "extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals" and "calculate intermediate results." Experiments using GPT-3 show PS+ prompting consistently outperforms zero-shot CoT across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning datasets. Although not directly comparable, PS+ also achieves results close to few-shot CoT prompting requiring manually crafted examples. The results indicate the proposed prompting strategies can elicit higher quality reasoning from LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is trying to address is:How to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 on complex multi-step reasoning tasks in a zero-shot setting, without requiring manual demonstration examples. In particular, the authors identify three key issues with the existing zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting approach:1. Calculation errors - Errors in the numeric calculations leading to incorrect answers.2. Missing reasoning step errors - Important intermediate reasoning steps being missed, especially for problems with many steps. 3. Semantic misunderstanding errors - Other coherence issues in the reasoning steps due to limitations of the LLM.To address the missing reasoning step issue, the authors propose a new zero-shot prompting approach called Plan-and-Solve (PS) prompting, which involves explicitly asking the LLM to devise a plan to break down the problem into subtasks, before solving it step-by-step. To further address calculation errors and improve reasoning quality, the authors extend PS prompting with more detailed instructions (PS+ prompting).The key research questions are:- Can the proposed PS and PS+ prompting approaches elicit better quality reasoning from LLMs compared to prior work?- How do these prompting strategies perform compared to few-shot prompting approaches with demonstration examples?- Can zero-shot prompting reach comparable performance to few-shot prompting?The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on multiple reasoning tasks and datasets. The goal is to show that more detailed prompting instructions can improve LLM reasoning performance in a zero-shot setting.
