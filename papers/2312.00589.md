# [Merlin:Empowering Multimodal LLMs with Foresight Minds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00589)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces Merlin, a multi-modal large language model empowered with foresight minds by jointly training trajectory prediction across frames and future event reasoning based on the predicted trajectories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two innovative methods to empower Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with "foresight minds":

1. Foresight Pre-Training (FPT): A paradigm that causally models temporal trajectories interleaved with multi-frame images. It starts with an initial observation in the first frame and requires the model to predict the whole trajectory. Various tasks with rich labeled data are used for multitask learning.

2. Future Instruction-Tuning (FIT): Considers the trajectory modeling from FPT as a bridge in the logical chain of future reasoning. It requires the model to first predict trajectories of objects and then reason about potential future events based on them. This acts as a form of "Trajectory Chain-of-Thought".

By combining FPT and FIT, the paper introduces Merlin - a novel unified MLLM capable of handling multi-image inputs and analysis about potential actions of multiple objects for future reasoning. Experiments show Merlin's powerful performance on both future reasoning and visual comprehension tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is empowering MLLMs with foresight abilities by modeling the future through trajectory prediction and reasoning. This is achieved via the proposed FPT and FIT methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest two main future research directions:

1. Developing a more efficient tokenizer for long-range videos. The current method relies on an image encoder and struggles to support video sequences exceeding 8 frames. Creating a better tokenizer to handle longer video sequences would allow the model to capture more extended motion information over time. 

2. Exploring the creation of a more robust and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating future reasoning abilities. While the paper introduces a new future reasoning benchmark using the MMBench framework, the authors state there is currently no accurate benchmark that thoroughly tests capabilities for future prediction and reasoning. Constructing an improved benchmark would better measure progress in this area.

In summary, the main limitations highlighted are handling long video sequences and the lack of a strong comprehensive benchmark for future reasoning evaluation. Addressing these issues through developing better video tokenization and more rigorous testing benchmarks are noted as important avenues for advancing research going forward.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Foresight Pre-Training (FPT) and Foresight Instruction Tuning (FIT) as the two key components for empowering multimodal LLMs with foresight minds. Could you further explain the motivation and intuition behind proposing these two components? How do they complement each other?

2. In FPT, you propose to causally model the trajectory interleaved with multi-frame images. Could you expand more on why trajectory serves as a good learning objective to obtain dynamic clues from images? What are other potential representations you considered for this?

3. The data construction process for FPT seems very involved with properly formatting tasks and converting them to question-answer pairs. What were some key challenges faced in constructing the right training data? Were there any negative impacts observed by training on this formatted data?

4. For FIT, you generate future observations using GPT-4 based on multi-frame descriptions and human priors. What was the process for composing these descriptions and priors to result in reasonable future inferences? What percentage of the generated inferences had to be filtered out?

5. The Trajectory Chain-of-Thought concept in FIT is very interesting. Do you think this idea could have broader applicability for multimodal models beyond just future reasoning? What other capabilities could potentially benefit from this? 

6. What were some other pre-training objectives you experimented with? Why did you find trajectory prediction to work the best compared to more traditional approaches like masked language modeling or next frame prediction?

7. The results show great improvement in object hallucination over prior work. To what extent do you think the gains are from FIT vs FPT? How does modeling trajectories help specifically avoid hallucinations?

8. For supporting longer video reasoning, what modifications would be needed in the proposed approach? Would simply using a video encoder help or are more substantial changes required?

9. The human evaluation results for consistency, specificity, and correctness are very strong. Is there a way to further analyze model performance by question type or dialog structure? Any insights into areas still needing improvement?

10. This paper focuses specifically on empowering foresight minds, but still relies on an existing MLLM architecture. If building an MLLM from scratch, how should the model architecture and pre-training evolve based on insights from this work?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V and Bard struggle to foresee future events based on current image observations, even when provided with additional context like multiple frames. This hinders their ability to learn fundamental principles of how things operate and the intentions behind observed subjects.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes integrating "future modeling" into MLLMs to address this gap. It utilizes the subject's trajectory - a structured representation of consecutive frames - as a learning objective to bridge the past and future. Two key methods are introduced:

1) Foresight Pre-Training (FPT): Jointly trains various tasks centered on trajectories, enabling models to predict entire trajectories from an initial observation. Diverse labeled data is used for multitask learning.

2) Foresight Instruction-Tuning (FIT): Requires models to first predict trajectories of related objects, then reason about potential future events based on them. This "Trajectory Chain-of-Thought" bridges trajectory perception and future reasoning.

Using FPT and FIT, the paper builds a unified MLLM called Merlin that supports multi-image input/analysis and future reasoning of multiple objects.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies inability of current MLLMs to foresee future events as a key deficiency 
- Proposes using subject trajectory prediction from initial observations as an objective to model the future
- Introduces two innovative training methods - FPT and FIT - to integrate future modeling into MLLMs 
- Constructs Merlin, a novel MLLM with powerful foresight minds - predicts trajectories and logical chains leading to future events
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on future reasoning tasks and general visual comprehension benchmarks

The paper makes notable strides in enhancing MLLMs' capacity for predictive reasoning based on visual observations. The future modeling approach brings new insights for developing stronger Artificial General Intelligence.
