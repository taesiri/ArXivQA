# [Beyond Worst-case Attacks: Robust RL with Adaptive Defense via   Non-dominated Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12673)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing robust RL methods focus on worst-case attack scenarios, compromising performance under no/weak attacks.
- Need a framework to enhance performance against non-worst-case attacks while maintaining robustness against worst-case ones.

Proposed Solution:
- Two phases - (1) Pre-train a set of policies called "non-dominated" policies (2) Online adaptation at test time among those policies
- Formalize online adaptation as a regret minimization problem. Show hardness of achieving low regret over general policy class $\Pi$.
- Propose refining $\Pi$ to smaller finite class $\Tilde{\Pi}$ for efficient online adaptation via adversarial bandit algorithms.
- For training, propose iterative algorithm to discover non-dominated policies to form a near-optimal $\Tilde{\Pi}$. Show convergence guarantees and efficiency compared to exhaustively removing dominated policies.

Main Contributions:
- Formalize and solve the problem of adaptive defense in RL against attacks beyond worst-case
- Propose novel training algorithm to iteratively discover non-dominated policies to get a near-optimal and small policy class $\Tilde{\Pi}$
- Demonstrate improved performance against both static and dynamic attacks compared to SOTA baselines
- Provide hardness results on achieving low regret at test time and on obtaining a small $\Tilde{\Pi}$.

The key novelty is in formulating the robust RL problem beyond worst-case attacks and proposing the two-phase protect framework. Both the training algorithm and online adaptation method are novel. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the improved robustness and adaptability of the framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework with two components - iteratively discovering a set of diverse, non-dominated policies during training to handle various attacks and adaptively combining them at test time based on online feedback against the current attacker - to improve robustness of reinforcement learning policies beyond just the worst-case scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new framework called PROTECTED for developing robust reinforcement learning (RL) agents against attacks beyond worst-case scenarios. The main contributions are:

1) It formalizes the problem of online adaptation during test time as a regret minimization problem and establishes the challenges in achieving sublinear regret with general policy classes. This motivates the use of a refined policy class for efficient online adaptation.

2) It proposes a novel training algorithm to iteratively discover "non-dominated" policies to form a near-optimal and minimal refined policy class. This ensures robustness against various attacks while enabling efficient online adaptation. 

3) It provides theoretical analysis on the optimality and efficiency of the discovered policy class. It also reveals the fundamental hardness that sufficiently large policy classes may be needed to achieve near optimality.

4) It conducts comprehensive experiments on Mujoco environments, validating the superiority of PROTECTED in terms of natural performance, robustness against both static and dynamic attacks, and adaptability to various attack scenarios.

In summary, the main contribution is a principled training algorithm and adaptive defense mechanism to improve robustness against non-worst-case attacks while maintaining competitiveness against worst-case attacks. This is achieved by discovering a diverse set of policies and adapting among them in response to attacks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Reinforcement learning (RL)
- Robustness against attacks
- State-adversarial attacks
- Worst-case attacks
- Non-worst-case attacks
- Online adaptation
- Regret minimization
- Non-dominated policies
- Policy discovery
- Multi-policy defense

The paper focuses on improving the robustness of RL policies against attacks, with a specific emphasis on going beyond only defending against worst-case attack scenarios. Key ideas include using online adaptation during test time to minimize regret, discovering a set of non-dominated policies during training that ensure good performance across different attackers, and adaptively selecting between these policies at test time. The goal is to maintain robustness against worst-case attacks while also improving performance when no or only weak attacks are present.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative algorithm to discover a set of policies called "non-dominated" policies. Can you explain in more detail the concept of a non-dominated policy and why discovering such policies is useful for robust reinforcement learning?

2. During test time, the method maintains a set of policies and adaptively selects among them based on previous interactions with the environment. How exactly does this online adaptation process work? What algorithms are used to adjust the weights over the set of policies?

3. The paper shows that achieving sublinear regret is intrinsically difficult when adapting among general policy classes. Can you explain the negative result in more detail and why introducing a refined, finite policy class enables efficient online adaptation?  

4. What are the key steps in the iterative discovery algorithm during training? In particular, what is the objective function being optimized at each iteration? Why is this objective beneficial?

5. The paper mentions the possibility of redundancy among the discovered non-dominated policies. What constitutes a redundant policy in this context and how can the method potentially eliminate redundant policies to improve efficiency?  

6. One of the results shows that in the worst case, the method may require discovering a large set of policies to achieve near optimality. What causes this hardness result? Are there ways to mitigate this issue in practice?

7. How does the method select which policy to attack during training when discovering new non-dominated policies? What approximations are made to render this attack process tractable?

8. From an attacker's perspective, what makes attacking an adaptive victim policy more challenging compared to attacking a fixed victim policy? How should the attacker formulate its objective?

9. The empirical results demonstrate improved performance against non-worst-case attacks. What properties of the method contribute specifically to enhanced robustness against weaker attacks?

10. Are there other potential ways the concept of non-dominated policies could be useful in reinforcement learning, besides improving robustness against attacks?
