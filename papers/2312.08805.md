# [Zoom in on the Plant: Fine-grained Analysis of Leaf, Stem and Vein   Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08805)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an approach for fine-grained plant analysis, including stem and vein detection, from single images captured in real-world agricultural settings. The authors introduce a new publicly available dataset called RumexLeaves containing 7747 manually annotated images of the problematic weed Rumex obtusifolius leaves. This is the first real-world weed dataset with stem and vein line annotations. They train a customized CenterNet model to simultaneously predict leaf instance masks using oriented bounding boxes and polylines representing the stems and veins, guided by distinct keypoints like lowest stem point and leaf basal/apex. To properly evaluate keypoint-guided polylines, the authors propose a new metric called POKS that allows some deviation of pseudo keypoints along line segments. Through ablation studies, they determine optimal model architecture and target representations, finding that ResNet50 with deformable convolutions performs best. The model achieves 0.450 POKS mAP on the iNaturalist test split but only 0.244 on their robot-captured test images, indicating difficulty generalizing to new distributions. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of fine-grained plant analysis including vein extraction on real-world agricultural images, enabled by the introduced POKS evaluation metric and RumexLeaves dataset.
