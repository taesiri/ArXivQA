# [Zoom in on the Plant: Fine-grained Analysis of Leaf, Stem and Vein   Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08805)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an approach for fine-grained plant analysis, including stem and vein detection, from single images captured in real-world agricultural settings. The authors introduce a new publicly available dataset called RumexLeaves containing 7747 manually annotated images of the problematic weed Rumex obtusifolius leaves. This is the first real-world weed dataset with stem and vein line annotations. They train a customized CenterNet model to simultaneously predict leaf instance masks using oriented bounding boxes and polylines representing the stems and veins, guided by distinct keypoints like lowest stem point and leaf basal/apex. To properly evaluate keypoint-guided polylines, the authors propose a new metric called POKS that allows some deviation of pseudo keypoints along line segments. Through ablation studies, they determine optimal model architecture and target representations, finding that ResNet50 with deformable convolutions performs best. The model achieves 0.450 POKS mAP on the iNaturalist test split but only 0.244 on their robot-captured test images, indicating difficulty generalizing to new distributions. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of fine-grained plant analysis including vein extraction on real-world agricultural images, enabled by the introduced POKS evaluation metric and RumexLeaves dataset.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robot perception is limited compared to humans in semantic scene understanding and extracting fine-grained intra-object details. For agricultural robots, fine details of plant architecture are needed for tasks like precision weeding or phenotyping. 

- Existing work in agriculture has focused on coarse traits like leaf shape/size or joint stem detection. Finer traits like leaf veins for advanced phenotyping or precise stem/vein localization for efficient weed control have not been addressed, especially in real-world settings.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a model to extract fine-grained phenotypic traits of plant leaves including leaf blade instances, stems, and leaf veins represented as polylines. 

- They use a customized CenterNet object detector with additional heatmap and regression heads to jointly predict leaf blade bounding boxes, stems, and veins. The vein polyline is guided by keypoints - with distinct true keypoints like leaf basal/apex and intermediate pseudo keypoints along the vein.

- To evaluate keypoint-guided polylines, a new metric called Projected OKS (POKS) is introduced. It projects predicted pseudo keypoints onto ground truth line segments before comparing to handle variations in intermediate keypoints along a vein segment.

Main Contributions:

- First model for joint fine-grained plant trait extraction including leaf instances, stems and veins from single images in real-world settings.

- New annotated dataset called RumexLeaves with 7747 images of Rumex weed leaves having instance masks and stem/vein polyline annotations.

- Proposed POKS metric to appropriately evaluate quality for keypoint-guided polylines as commonly needed for linear structures like veins.

- Detailed experimental analysis with baseline models and results on the new dataset along with comparisons of POKS versus standard OKS.
