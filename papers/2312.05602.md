# [EipFormer: Emphasizing Instance Positions in 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05602)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the task of 3D instance segmentation. This involves accurately labeling and segmenting individual object instances within 3D point clouds. While progress has been made in this area, existing methods have certain limitations:

1) They rely on fixed instance positions (obtained via center prediction or farthest point sampling) to group points into instances. However, due to the abundance of points, these positions often deviate from actual instance centers, making precise instance segmentation difficult. 

2) They group instances based on a single type of coordinate, which can make distinguishing neighboring instances or incorporating edge points challenging.

Proposed Solution:
To address these issues, the paper proposes EipFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture for 3D instance segmentation. The key ideas are:

1) Progressive Aggregation: This refines instance proposals in a coarse-to-fine manner over three stages:
    - Coarse stage: Generates coarse proposals using weighted farthest point sampling.
    - Fine stage: Refines proposals by updating positions via aggregation averaging. Matches refined positions to ground truth.   
    - Merge stage: Supplements omitted instances from fine stage by inheriting refined proposals.
    
2) Dual Position Embedding: Combines original position embedding and centrally shifted embedding to distinguish neighboring instances while preserving shape.

3) Class-Aware Point Sampling: Selectively samples points to reduce memory usage.

Contributions:

1) Proposes progressive aggregation using weighted FPS, aggregation averaging, and center matching for precise instance segmentation.

2) Presents dual position embedding to effectively separate neighboring instances.  

3) Introduces class-aware point sampling to optimize memory consumption.

Experiments conducted on STPLS3D, S3DIS, and ScanNet demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods without any post-processing. The key strengths are more precise segmentation and differentiating adjacent instances.
