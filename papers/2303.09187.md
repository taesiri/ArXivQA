# [PSVT: End-to-End Multi-person 3D Pose and Shape Estimation with   Progressive Video Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09187)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform end-to-end multi-person 3D human pose and shape estimation from monocular video. Specifically, it proposes a new method called PSVT to capture long-range spatio-temporal global interactions for multi-person pose and shape estimation in video.

The key hypothesis is that modeling global context dependencies among different people spatially and temporally in video can improve multi-person 3D pose and shape estimation compared to prior methods.
