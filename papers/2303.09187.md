# [PSVT: End-to-End Multi-person 3D Pose and Shape Estimation with   Progressive Video Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09187)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform end-to-end multi-person 3D human pose and shape estimation from monocular video. Specifically, it proposes a new method called PSVT to capture long-range spatio-temporal global interactions for multi-person pose and shape estimation in video.

The key hypothesis is that modeling global context dependencies among different people spatially and temporally in video can improve multi-person 3D pose and shape estimation compared to prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes PSVT, the first end-to-end multi-person 3D human pose and shape estimation framework with video Transformer. This allows capturing long-range spatio-temporal context for multi-person pose and shape estimation in videos.

2. It proposes a novel progressive decoding mechanism (PDM) for the decoder of video Transformer, which updates the queries at each frame using the output tokens from the previous frame. This improves the pose and shape decoding performance. 

3. It proposes a novel pose-guided attention (PGA) module, which aligns the pose and shape tokens to better guide the shape decoder using pose information. This improves shape estimation performance.

4. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed PSVT framework and the new components PDM and PGA.

In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end Transformer framework for multi-person pose and shape estimation in videos, with novel components for progressive decoding and using pose to guide shape estimation. The experiments validate its state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes PSVT, an end-to-end multi-person 3D pose and shape estimation framework with progressive video transformer that captures long-range spatio-temporal context in videos through a spatio-temporal encoder and decoder with novel progressive decoding and pose-guided attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in multi-person 3D human pose and shape estimation:

- Novelty: This paper proposes a new end-to-end framework using video Transformers for multi-person 3D pose and shape estimation. Most prior work uses separate detectors and single-person estimators. This unifies spatial and temporal modeling in one framework.

- Modeling: The proposed PSVT model incorporates a spatial-temporal encoder and decoder to capture relationships between multiple people across both space and time. This allows capturing richer context compared to methods that focus only on single frames or single people.

- Attention: The paper introduces a progressive decoding mechanism and pose-guided attention in the decoder to explicitly model relationships between pose and shape over time. This is a new way to integrate information that is not used by other methods.

- Performance: Experiments across multiple datasets (RH, AGORA, CMU, 3DPW) show state-of-the-art results compared to prior work, demonstrating effectiveness. The gains are especially notable for crowded scenes and videos.

- Limitations: The approach still struggles with complex motions and occlusions. The computational expense of modeling full videos and attention across people is also high.

In summary, this paper pushes forward multi-person 3D pose and shape estimation by developing a new spatio-temporal Transformer framework and attention mechanisms tailored for this task. The results advance the state-of-the-art, while limitations point to areas for continued research. The novel modeling and strong empirics make this a valuable contribution to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring end-to-end optimization of the full framework. The current method still relies on a detection module to localize people before estimating pose and shape. Developing an end-to-end framework that jointly handles detection and estimation could be beneficial.

- Extending the approach to handle video input. The current method operates on single images. Leveraging temporal information across frames in video could help improve accuracy and temporal consistency. 

- Exploring alternative backbone architectures. The authors use HRNet as the feature extractor, but note that transformer backbones like Swin could be promising to capture longer-range dependencies.

- Improving generalization to unseen data distributions. While the method achieves good results on common benchmarks, performance drops significantly on uncommon poses/appearances. Developing techniques to improve generalization is important.

- Reducing computational cost. The transformer architecture is computationally expensive. Exploring efficient approximations to reduce compute while maintaining accuracy could enable broader application.

- Jointly modeling pose, shape, and texture. The current method only estimates pose and shape. Jointly recovering texture information could enable more photorealistic rendering and analysis applications.

- Exploring self-supervised and weakly supervised techniques to reduce annotation requirements. The method relies heavily on full 3D supervision, which is expensive to collect. Utilizing weaker forms of supervision could improve scalability.

In summary, the main directions are developing end-to-end frameworks, leveraging temporal video information, improving generalization, reducing compute costs, modeling texture, and reducing supervision requirements. Advances in these areas could help enable broader adoption of human pose and shape estimation in practice.

This paper proposes PSVT, a new end-to-end framework for multi-person 3D pose and shape estimation from video using progressive video transformers. The method captures long-range spatio-temporal context among different people in the video to jointly estimate their 3D poses and body shapes. 

PSVT consists of a spatio-temporal encoder to model relationships between spatial feature tokens across frames. The decoder contains a spatio-temporal pose decoder to estimate 3D joints, and a spatio-temporal shape decoder with a novel pose-guided attention mechanism to estimate SMPL body models. A progressive decoding mechanism recursively updates the decoder queries using prior estimates to handle appearance changes over time. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-stage and transformer methods. Key benefits are the end-to-end joint modeling of multiple people across space and time, and the improved shape estimation from guiding the attention with pose information. Limitations include failures on complex motions and occlusions.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of end-to-end multi-person 3D pose and shape estimation from video. Specifically, it aims to capture the global spatio-temporal context among different people in the video for more accurate 3D pose and shape estimation.

The key questions/challenges it aims to address are:

- How to model the global spatial relationships and interactions between different people in each video frame for multi-person pose/shape estimation? 

- How to effectively capture the temporal information and long-range dependencies between frames and people for consistent video-based pose/shape estimation?

- How to jointly estimate 3D poses and shapes for multiple people in an end-to-end framework directly from video frames?

Most prior works adopt a multi-stage approach by first detecting each person, then estimating per-person pose/shape, which cannot capture global context. This paper proposes a unified end-to-end transformer framework called PSVT to address these challenges.
