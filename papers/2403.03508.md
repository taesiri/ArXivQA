# [Probing the Robustness of Time-series Forecasting Models with   CounterfacTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Time series forecasting models suffer from lack of robustness on out-of-distribution data. This happens because the test data distribution changes over time (concept drift) resulting in new data that falls outside the training distribution.
- This leads to poor performance on the new out-of-distribution data and makes it difficult to reliably anticipate the impact of future events.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents CounterfacTS, a tool to probe model robustness via counterfactuals. Counterfactuals are alternate versions of data to simulate hypothetical scenarios.

- CounterfacTS allows visualizing data distributions in 2D space and model performance for individual time series. It also allows transforming time series to create counterfactuals with desired properties.

- This is used to populate undersampled regions of the distribution and retrain models to improve robustness. Interpretable transformations help understand the effect of data properties on model performance.

Main Contributions:
- Interactive graphical user interface to visualize data, model forecasts, quantification of errors.

- Explore variation in model performance w.r.t location of time series data. Identify characteristics affecting performance.  

- Guidance to transform time series and generate counterfactuals for undersampled regions.

- Demonstrated methodology to improve model robustness on out-of-distribution data using counterfactuals.

- Enables gaining insight into model performance and anticipation of potential events through interpretable counterfactuals.

In summary, CounterfacTS facilitates exploration of model robustness via counterfactual reasoning in time series forecasting. This allows anticipating the effect of hypothetical future events.
