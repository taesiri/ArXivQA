# [ClusterTabNet: Supervised clustering method for table detection and   table structure recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of detecting tables in documents and recognizing their structure, which is an important step towards automatically understanding document contents. Prior methods using heuristics or treating it as an object detection task have limitations in generalization, model complexity, and robustness. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel transformer-based neural network that casts table detection and structure recognition as a graph clustering problem. Specifically, relations between words like co-occurrence in the same row, column or cell are modeled as a graph adjacency matrix predicted by the transformer encoder. Words are embedded using their OCR output and optionally image patches. The model outputs multiple adjacency matrices, one per structural element like rows, columns etc. Connected components in the predicted graphs after thresholding give the final detected tables elements.

Key Contributions:
- Formulates table detection and structure recognition as a supervised clustering problem, enabled by a transformer encoder architecture. 

- Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy with a smaller 5M parameter model, compared to prior 29M parameter detection models.

- Robust to document orientation variations and defects since it relies on OCR output instead of raw document images.

- Can optionally incorporate visual information via embedded image patches for further accuracy improvements.

- Quantitatively evaluated on PubTabNet, FinTabNet and PubTables-1M datasets, showing performance matching or exceeding prior DETR and Faster R-CNN models.

In summary, the paper presents a new way to leverage transformers to cluster words based on structural relationships, demonstrating strong results on table detection and recognition tasks while using a simpler and smaller model.
