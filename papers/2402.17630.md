# [Fine-Grained Natural Language Inference Based Faithfulness Evaluation   for Diverse Summarisation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing approaches for evaluating the faithfulness of abstractive summaries using natural language inference (NLI) models are sub-optimal. They take either a single sentence or the full document as the premise to entail summary sentences. However, summaries often fuse content from multiple document sentences, so a single sentence is insufficient context while the full document brings in irrelevant content that harms entailment judgments.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a new approach called InFusE that operates at a more appropriate level of granularity. It incrementally retrieves the best context from the document to entail each summary sentence, expanding the context until entailment scores decrease. It also splits summary sentences into simpler hypotheses representing separate content units to improve precision of entailment. 

Main Contributions:
- Introduces InFusE for finer-grained NLI-based evaluation using variable premise sizes and simplified hypotheses 
- Analyzes performance on diverse summarization tasks by creating a new benchmark, DiverSumm
- Shows InFusE outperforms previous approaches across single and multi-document summarization
- Demonstrates the value of appropriate granularity levels when using off-the-shelf NLI models for faithfulness evaluation
- Provides analysis of different error types and sources of entailment score bias

In summary, the paper argues for and shows the benefits of assessing the faithfulness of summaries at more fine-grained levels when using NLI models, through an approach that incrementally finds the best entailing premise context and creates simpler hypothesis units. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on diverse summarization tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called InFusE for evaluating the faithfulness of abstractive summaries to source documents by using natural language inference to compare the summary content to an adaptively selected subset of the most relevant document sentences at a finer granularity level.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new approach called InFusE for evaluating the faithfulness of summaries. The key ideas of InFusE are:

1) Using an incremental reasoning process to retrieve a variable-sized context from the document to serve as the premise when judging entailment with each summary sentence. This allows adapting the premise size to the information density in different summary sentences. 

2) Decomposing summary sentences into shorter sub-sentences via sentence simplification. This creates finer-grained hypotheses for entailment checking and handles the issue of multiple document sentences fusing content into a single complex summary sentence.

3) Analyzing the performance of NLI-based faithfulness evaluation approaches across diverse summarization tasks by introducing a new benchmark called DiverSumm. This includes long document summarization and multi-document summarization datasets.

The paper shows through experiments that InFusE achieves better performance than prior NLI-based approaches for faithfulness evaluation because it operates at more appropriate granularity levels for premises and hypotheses when using off-the-shelf NLI models. The results demonstrate the value of the innovations of InFusE across different summarization tasks.

The paper proposes a new approach called InFusE for evaluating summary faithfulness using off-the-shelf NLI models. The key ideas are leveraging variable/adaptive premise sizes, reversing entailment direction to improve context retrieval, and simplifying summary sentences to enable sub-sentence level reasoning. Experiments show these techniques improve performance on diverse summarization tasks compared to prior context-level and document-level NLI baselines. A new DiverSumm benchmark is also introduced to facilitate analysis on long document and multi-document summarization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that existing NLI-based approaches for evaluating summary faithfulness do not operate at the right level of granularity. Could you elaborate on what is meant by "right level of granularity" here and why it is important?

2. The proposed approach, InFusE, performs incremental reasoning to retrieve the best possible context from the document to assess the faithfulness of each summary sentence. What are the key steps in this incremental reasoning process and how do they allow selecting a variable-sized context?

3. InFusE further simplifies summary sentences via sentence splitting. What is the rationale behind this step and in what types of summarization tasks does it provide the most value? Provide some examples.

4. The paper introduces reversed reasoning to re-weight document sentences in the context retrieval step. What scenarios does this especially help with and why? Provide concrete examples from the paper.  

5. What are some limitations of the stopping criteria used in the incremental reasoning step of InFusE? How could it potentially lead to suboptimal premise selection?

6. From a computational efficiency standpoint, what is the time complexity of InFusE relative to other context-level NLI approaches with a fixed context size? How could the complexity be further optimized?

7. The paper analyzes performance on different error types. Summarize the key findings. For which error types does InFusE exhibit superior detection capabilities and why?

8. The error analysis reveals that the NLI model used exhibits biases based on lexical overlap and premise-hypothesis length. How do these biases manifest and how could they be mitigated?  

9. Beyond the datasets studied, what other summarization tasks could especially benefit from the InFusE approach? Why?

10. The paper compares performance on extractive versus abstractive summarization datasets. What differences do you observe and what conclusions can you draw about the applicability of InFusE across datasets with varying levels of abstractiveness?
