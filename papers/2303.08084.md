# [Editing Implicit Assumptions in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08084)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can specific implicit assumptions in a pre-trained text-to-image model be edited after training? The authors propose a method called TIME (Text-to-Image Model Editing) to edit the implicit assumptions encoded in a text-to-image diffusion model. The key idea is to modify the projection matrices in the cross-attention layers of the model to change how textual concepts are mapped to visual meanings.The paper aims to show that by providing TIME with a source text prompt that contains an implicit assumption, and a related destination prompt specifying a desired attribute, it can update the model to align the source prompt with the destination prompt. This allows editing the assumptions and biases learned by the model during training, without requiring extra user input or model retraining.So in summary, the main research question addressed is how to edit implicit assumptions in pretrained text-to-image models using only text prompts as input. The proposed TIME method provides a way to do this by updating the cross-attention projections.
