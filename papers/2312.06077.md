# [An Ambiguity Measure for Recognizing the Unknowns in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06077)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a unified framework to quantify the "unknowns" of deep learning models by defining an ambiguity measure. The measure is based on the geometric arrangements of the decision boundaries and convex hulls of the training data in the feature space learned by the model. Specifically, it considers four components - distance to the closest decision boundary, distance to the closest convex hull, difference in distance to the two closest convex hulls to capture confusion in case of overlapping classes, and size of the largest gap in the convex hull around the input to measure gaps in model's knowledge. The ambiguity measure can identify mistakes on in-distribution data, detect adversarial inputs, as well as flag out-of-distribution inputs. It allows models to abstain from classification when inputs are ambiguous, leading to more reliable predictions in real-world use. The paper also shows that there is valuable geometric information in the feature space of models which has often been overlooked. Experiments demonstrate that the ambiguity measure can explain model failures better than confidence scores. Overall, this presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated approach to characterize model limitations based on geometry, paving way for more transparent and reliable AI.
