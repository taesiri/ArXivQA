# [An Ambiguity Measure for Recognizing the Unknowns in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06077)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a unified framework to quantify the "unknowns" of deep learning models by defining an ambiguity measure. The measure is based on the geometric arrangements of the decision boundaries and convex hulls of the training data in the feature space learned by the model. Specifically, it considers four components - distance to the closest decision boundary, distance to the closest convex hull, difference in distance to the two closest convex hulls to capture confusion in case of overlapping classes, and size of the largest gap in the convex hull around the input to measure gaps in model's knowledge. The ambiguity measure can identify mistakes on in-distribution data, detect adversarial inputs, as well as flag out-of-distribution inputs. It allows models to abstain from classification when inputs are ambiguous, leading to more reliable predictions in real-world use. The paper also shows that there is valuable geometric information in the feature space of models which has often been overlooked. Experiments demonstrate that the ambiguity measure can explain model failures better than confidence scores. Overall, this presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated approach to characterize model limitations based on geometry, paving way for more transparent and reliable AI.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1) Proposing a unified ambiguity measure that can relate different failure modes of deep learning models (such as mistakes on in-distribution data, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution failures) into a common framework. This ambiguity measure is based on the geometric arrangements of the decision boundaries and convex hulls of training data in the feature space learned by the models.

2) Providing a theoretical analysis to characterize the unknowns (things the model does not know) in relation to the model's confidence levels. This includes formally defining regions of guaranteed high/low confidence and improper high confidence (overconfidence on inputs irrelevant to the model's training scope). 

3) Algorithms and empirical analysis to compute the various geometric quantities needed to calculate the ambiguity measure efficiently even for large models.

4) Showing how the ambiguity measure can be used in practice for abstention at inference time or training auxiliary "ambiguity models" to detect undesirable failure-prone inputs.

5) Demonstrating that there is valuable and often neglected geometric information in the feature spaces and convex hulls learned by deep networks that can provide insight into their failure modes.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel ambiguity measure and framework that leverages geometric properties of deep learning models to unify and provide insight into various failure modes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Ambiguity measure - The paper proposes a unified framework and measure to quantify the ambiguity of inputs for a trained deep learning model, related to what the model does and does not know.

- Convex hull - The convex hull of the training data in the feature space of a model is used as part of defining model scope and ambiguity. Distances to convex hulls are part of the ambiguity measure.

- Decision boundaries - Distances to decision boundaries in the feature space are also used as part of the proposed ambiguity measure.

- Unknowns - A major focus is characterizing and quantifying the "unknowns" of a trained model, things that are ambiguous or that the model does not have knowledge about.

- Confidence - The paper relates ambiguity to model confidence, and identifies regions of guaranteed high/low confidence.

- Failure modes - The ambiguity framework aims to connect and detect various failure modes like mistakes on in-distribution examples, adversarial examples, out-of-distribution failures.

- Abstention - High ambiguity inputs can trigger a model to abstain from classification.

- Explanation - The ambiguity measure can be used to automatically generate textual explanations of why an input is ambiguous.

In summary, key ideas revolve around using geometric properties of a model's learned feature space to define and quantify ambiguity, relating this to model failures, confidence, and knowledge scope.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an ambiguity measure based on geometric arrangements in the feature space. What is the intuition behind using geometry in the feature space to quantify ambiguity? How does this relate to the model's training set and decision boundaries?

2. One component of the ambiguity measure is the distance to the convex hull of the training set. Why is the convex hull important here? What does being inside or outside the convex hull intuitively signify about an input?

3. Another component is the distance to the closest decision boundary. Explain the relationship derived in the paper between distance to decision boundaries and model confidence. Why is this relationship key for defining ambiguity?  

4. The paper argues that closeness to decision boundaries is the only factor that determines model confidence. Discuss the theoretical guarantee provided in the paper for this statement. What are its limitations or caveats?

5. Explain the distinction made in the paper between separable and overlapping classes. How does the ambiguity measure handle these two cases differently in terms of quantifying confusion?

6. The formulation of the full ambiguity measure has four components. Walk through each component and explain what aspect of ambiguity it aims to capture. How do these four components complement each other?

7. One version of the ambiguity measure uses a simplified "rule of thumb." How does this compare, both theoretically and empirically, to the full formulation? When might the simplified version fall short?

8. Discuss the abstention model using the ambiguity measure. How does the choice of ambiguity threshold affect which inputs get abstained? What are some practical considerations in choosing this threshold?  

9. Explain the proposed idea of training an "ambiguity model" to detect undesirable inputs. What types of undesirable inputs can this detect? How does it differ from other detection models?

10. The paper claims unknowns constitute a large portion of a model's domain. Discuss what this means and how the paper establishes theoretically that models can still have high confidence in classifying these unknown regions.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Deep learning models can make mistakes on certain inputs, such as adversarial examples or out-of-distribution data, that appear trivial or easy to classify correctly. 
- Models also often do not know what they do not know - they can be overconfident on inputs that are ambiguous or outside their training distribution.
- There is a lack of unified frameworks to identify different failure modes like adversarial inputs, out-of-distribution data, corner cases, etc. in a harmonious way.

Proposed Solution  
- Define an ambiguity measure based on the geometric arrangement of decision boundaries and training data convex hulls in the model's learned feature space.
- The measure captures multiple components: distance to closest decision boundary, distance to closest training convex hull, difference in distances to two closest convex hulls, size of gap around the input that has no nearby training samples.
- Can identify regions of guaranteed high/low confidence in the feature space. Also regions far from the training distribution where model confidence is improperly high.
- Use the ambiguity measure for abstention at inference time or to train an auxiliary ambiguity detection model.

Main Contributions
- Unified ambiguity framework to relate different failure modes like mistakes on in-distribution data, adversarial vulnerability, out-of-distribution generalization.
- Formally define and identify unknown regions where model is guaranteed to still be highly confident, i.e. overconfident. 
- Fast algorithms to compute components of ambiguity measure from geometric properties.
- Experiments showing ambiguity measure detects considerable portions of different failure cases.
- Automatically generate natural language explanations of input ambiguity.
