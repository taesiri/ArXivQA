# [SwiftBrush: One-Step Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Variational   Score Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05239)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SwiftBrush, a novel one-step text-to-image diffusion model trained using a distillation approach inspired by recent advances in text-to-3D generation. Specifically, SwiftBrush adapts the variational score distillation loss typically used to optimize 3D neural radiance fields without 3D supervision to instead distill a student text-to-image generator from a teacher model such as Stable Diffusion. A key insight is that the rendered 2D images from text-conditioned 3D models can simply be replaced by the student's output. Notably, SwiftBrush is the first distillation method for text-to-image models that does not require actual images for training - only text captions are used. Experiments demonstrate SwiftBrush's ability to produce high-fidelity, controllable images in one step while quantitatively matching or exceeding state-of-the-art techniques across standard benchmarks. The simplified training procedure and improved efficiency could expand the accessibility of high-quality text-to-image generation. Analyses provide ablative justification for SwiftBrush's design decisions. Future work includes extending SwiftBrush to low-step generation and integrating techniques for user conditioning.
