# [PAD: Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Patchwise-Scale Adapter for   Infrared Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08192)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper tackles three main challenges in self-supervised learning (SSL) for infrared images: the lack of a large-scale diverse pre-training dataset, the distinctiveness of non-iconic infrared images that makes masked image modeling less effective, and the scarcity of textures that makes learning general features difficult. To address this, the authors construct a 178,756-image pre-training dataset spanning various scenarios and propose random RoI cropping to generate more iconic images. They also introduce a pre-training paradigm called PAD, which freezes ImageNet-pretrained parameters to retain general feature extraction capabilities and uses adapters to learn domain-specific features. Furthermore, a patchwise-scale adapter is proposed to dynamically coordinate the fusion between domain-specific and general features for each layer and patch. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks demonstrate that PAD with only 1.23M extra parameters outperforms continual full pre-training and other baselines. The proposed dataset construction, image preprocessing, and adapter-based pre-training paradigm effectively tackle key challenges in infrared SSL and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-supervised pre-training paradigm with patchwise-scale adapter (PAD) to address challenges in infrared image pre-training, including constructing a large-scale infrared pre-training dataset, handling non-iconic images, and balancing general and domain-specific feature learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Construction of a large and diverse infrared pre-training dataset MSIP and providing extensive experimental benchmarks for infrared self-supervised learning for the first time.

2. Introduction of object-sensitive random RoI cropping, an image preprocessing method to tackle the issue associated with small objects in infrared self-supervised learning.

3. Proposal of the PAD paradigm that allows the model to learn domain-specific features while retaining the ability to acquire general features. A patchwise-scale adapter is also introduced to adaptively determine the importance of domain-specific features for each patch. 

4. Extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of the proposed methods, outperforming other baseline paradigms. The PAD paradigm with only 1.23M pre-trainable parameters surpasses continual full pre-training of the entire 85.8M parameter model.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in constructing infrared pre-training resources, designing tailored pre-processing and model training strategies, and empirically showing superior performance over baselines, advancing infrared self-supervised learning research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper constructs a new infrared image dataset MSIP for pre-training. What are some key considerations and steps when curating this dataset? How does MSIP compare to existing infrared datasets in terms of scale, diversity, and redundancy?

2. The paper mentions that small objects being split into very few patches poses challenges when using high mask ratios during pre-training. Explain this issue in more detail and discuss how the proposed random RoI cropping method addresses this problem. 

3. The PAD paradigm freezes the original network parameters during infrared pre-training while only training the adapters. Explain the motivation behind this and why this avoids the model forgetting general visual features compared to continual full pre-training.

4. What are some limitations of using a fixed or layerwise scale factor in adapters? How does the proposed patchwise-scale adapter overcome these limitations? Discuss its advantages.  

5. Analyze the effect of the scale factor hyperparameter in adapters - how does it couple with the learning rate during training and influence feature fusion during inference?

6. Compare and contrast the attention maps visualized for different pre-training paradigms in Figure 3. What insights do they provide about the roles of general and domain-specific features?

7. The patchwise-scale adapter module has a simple design with only one linear layer. Propose some potential extensions or modifications to enrich its modeling capability.  

8. Figure 6 visualizes the scale factors predicted by the patchwise-scale module on unseen data. Analyze these patterns and discuss what they imply about the module's generalization ability.

9. The paper demonstrates PAD with MAE. Propose other MIM methods that could benefit from the PAD paradigm for infrared pre-training and discuss potential advantages.

10. The paper mentions limitations of dynamic adapter fusion after pre-training. Suggest possible solutions that could allow incorporating the patchwise-scale adapters into the original model during inference.
