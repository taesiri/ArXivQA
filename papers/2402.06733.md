# [NICE: To Optimize In-Context Examples or Not?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work shows optimizing in-context examples (ICE) significantly improves large language model (LLM) accuracy on many tasks, leading to a consensus that ICE optimization is crucial. 
- However, most prior work assumes a fixed or no instruction is provided to the LLM. This paper challenges the necessity of ICE optimization when detailed task-specific instructions are given.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper systematically studies the interplay between instructions and ICE across diverse tasks using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
- It introduces a new metric called Normalized Invariability to Choice of Examples (NICE) that quantifies how much a task's performance varies with different ICE selections for a given instruction.

Key Findings:
- For many tasks like text classification and QA, adding more detailed instructions diminishes the returns from ICE optimization. Detailed instructions with even random ICE match or exceed optimized ICE. 
- For schema-based generative tasks like semantic parsing and question decomposition, optimizing ICE still significantly boosts accuracy over random ICE.
- The NICE metric effectively predicts whether to optimize instructions or ICE for better performance on a new task. Tasks with high NICE benefit more from instruction optimization.

Main Contributions:
- Contrary to prior belief, the paper shows ICE optimization does not always improve LLM accuracy, especially with detailed task-specific instructions.
- It provides practical guidelines for deciding whether to optimize instructions or examples for a new task using the proposed NICE score.
- The paper advances our understanding of how instructions and examples interact and their relative importance for in-context learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper finds that as more detailed task instructions are provided to large language models, there are diminishing returns to optimizing the selection of in-context examples for most tasks, and proposes a metric to determine when in-context example optimization would be most beneficial.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a practical, task-specific metric called Normalized Invariability to Choice of Examples (NICE) that helps predict if a given task and instruction will benefit more from in-context example (ICE) optimization or improving the instruction. The key findings are:

- Contrary to prior assumptions, ICE optimization does not always improve performance and has diminishing returns as more detailed instructions are provided. 

- The NICE metric quantifies the invariability of a model's performance to the choice of ICE. It can reliably determine for a given task if ICE optimization matters more or improving instructions.

- For high-NICE tasks, detailed instructions with random ICE perform as well as prompts with optimized ICE. For low-NICE generative tasks, ICE optimization is more effective.

- The paper provides a method using the NICE score to decide whether to optimize instructions or ICE to improve an LLM's accuracy on a new task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- In-context learning (ICL) - Using example demonstrations within the input prompt to teach large language models new tasks. 

- In-context examples (ICE) - The specific examples provided in the prompt to teach the model.

- Instruction tuning - Method of teaching models by providing natural language instructions. 

- Prompt optimization - Deciding whether to improve instructions or optimize ICE selections to get better performance.

- Normalized Invariability to Choice of Examples (NICE) - Proposed metric to measure whether a task benefits more from instruction improvements or ICE optimization. 

- High/low NICE tasks - Categories of tasks that see diminishing/increasing returns from optimizing ICE respectively when instructions improve.

The main keywords cover in-context learning, prompt optimization, the NICE metric, and categorization of tasks based on whether they need ICE optimization or can rely on instructions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes the NICE metric to measure the invariability of a task's performance to the choice of in-context examples. How exactly is this metric calculated? What are the key components it depends on?

2. The paper makes a key distinction between high and low NICE tasks. What characterizes high NICE tasks and what characterizes low NICE tasks? Provide some examples of each from the paper. 

3. For high NICE tasks, the paper argues optimized in-context examples provide diminishing returns over random examples with detailed instructions. What evidence supports this claim? Discuss the results.

4. For low NICE tasks, what benefits does optimizing in-context examples provide over random selection? Explain why this difference occurs. 

5. The paper introduces a structured prompt template with gradually increasing levels of detail in the instruction. How does the choice of instruction level interact with the NICE score of tasks?

6. When introducing incorrect or shuffled labels in the in-context examples, how does the model's performance change across low/high NICE tasks? What does this suggest about the role of examples?

7. The paper argues the NICE metric can be used to decide whether to optimize instructions or examples for a new task. Walk through how you would apply this analysis to a new task. 

8. What are some limitations of relying solely on the NICE score to determine prompt optimization strategies? When might the heuristic fail?

9. The metric calculates bin-wise scores by partitioning examples based on similarity. How sensitive is NICE to the choice of partitioning method? Could more advanced clustering methods improve it?

10. The paper focuses on comparing instructions and examples. How could the NICE framework be extended to jointly optimize over both prompt components?
