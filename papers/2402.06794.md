# [Is it safe to cross? Interpretable Risk Assessment with GPT-4V for   Safety-Aware Street Crossing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Safely navigating street crossings is challenging for blind and visually impaired people as it requires comprehending complex visual information in the environment. 
- Traditional methods like traffic signal recognition are limited in providing a holistic safety assessment.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an approach using large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V to interpret street crossing scenes and make safety decisions.
- They collect a custom outdoor street crossing dataset using a quadruped robot with egocentric multiview images and predefined safety score annotations.
- Visual knowledge including object detections, segmentation masks and optical flow is extracted from the images. 
- This visual data along with text prompts is fed into GPT-4V to predict safety scores and generate natural language scene descriptions.

Key Contributions:
- Unique data collection of robot egocentric images for street crossing scenarios
- Safety score annotation methodology for crosswalk images 
- Evaluation of LMM's ability to assess safety and describe scenes using visual and textual prompts
- Analysis of different visual features and their impacts on model performance for this task
- Demonstration of LMM's potential to aid blind navigation by enhanced contextual understanding

The key goal is developing LMM-based robotic mobility aids for blind people to safely cross streets, moving beyond traditional solutions like traffic signal recognition. Findings show optical flow improves safety prediction, highlighting the value of temporal visual information.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large multimodal models to provide comprehensive scene understanding and risk assessment for safety-aware navigation at street intersections, with the goal of developing a reliable robotic mobility aid for blind and low-vision individuals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Data collection of multiview egocentric images in a crosswalk environment for street crossing using a quadruped robot. 

2) Safety score categorization based on egocentric images into 5 levels to indicate how safe it is for a pedestrian to cross the street.

3) Evaluation of the large multimodal model GPT-4V for safety score prediction and scene description using visual knowledge (object detection, optical flow, segmentation masks) and text prompts. This explores the capability of GPT-4V to understand street crossing safety.

So in summary, the key contributions are around the data collection, safety score labeling, and evaluation of GPT-4V for safety-aware street crossing understanding to potentially develop a reliable mobility aid.
