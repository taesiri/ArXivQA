# [Investigating the Impact of Model Instability on Explanations and   Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explainable AI (XAI) methods like saliency maps facilitate understanding of model behavior, but are unstable - small input perturbations can vastly distort explanations. 
- Explanations are typically evaluated holistically before deployment, making it hard to assess when an explanation is trustworthy.
- Some studies try to estimate confidence of explanations, but don't examine the link between uncertainty and explanation quality.

Methodology:
- Simulate epistemic uncertainty by introducing varying levels and types of realistic noise perturbations into text at inference time for pre-trained language models.
- Measure the effect on model performance, confidence (predictive and epistemic uncertainty), and explanation plausibility across models, datasets, perturbation levels and types.
- Use gradient-based explanation methods like Integrated Gradients, SmoothGrad, Guided Backprop and InputXGradients.
- Evaluate relationship between uncertainty and explanation plausibility using correlation analysis. 

Key Findings:
- Realistic perturbations have minimal impact on performance, confidence and explanations unlike masking. 
- High uncertainty doesn't imply low explanation plausibility; positive correlation is seen for models trained with noisy data.
- Noise-augmented models may identify salient tokens better when uncertain.
- Explanation instability can indicate model stability issues when uncertainty measures are overconfident.
- Integrated Gradients shows greatest robustness to perturbations overall, but model-specific patterns exist.

Main Contributions:
- Large-scale empirical analysis of the effect of realistic noise on language model performance, uncertainty and explanations.
- Investigation of relationship between uncertainty and explanation quality.
- Analysis of gradient-based explanation techniques' robustness to perturbations across models.
- Suggestion for using Integrated Gradients for smaller language models in Human-XAI collaboration.

Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary further. I tried to capture the key aspects clearly and concisely.
