# [Text as Image: Learning Transferable Adapter for Multi-Label   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04160)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called TaI-Adapter for multi-label image classification. It uses a large language model to automatically generate text descriptions for any set of labels of interest. These text embeddings are then used to train an adapter network for label classification. A key contribution is the introduction of random perturbation and its variants that inject text embeddings with noise, allowing the adapter network to better transfer from text modality to visual modality during inference. The overall framework enables zero-shot, few-shot, and partial-label learning on images in an open-vocabulary way without any manual data. Extensive experiments on VOC 2007, MS-COCO, and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The framework provides a fully automated pipeline for multi-label image recognition that leverages language models and alignment between text and image embeddings in CLIP.
