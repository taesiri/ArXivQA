# [Leveraging graph neural networks for supporting Automatic Triage of   Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the challenge of accurately prioritizing patients in emergency department (ED) triage. Traditional manual triage methods rely heavily on subjective human decisions, leading to inconsistencies and errors. The authors propose leveraging artificial intelligence and network science for automated, data-driven triage to minimize such issues.  

Proposed Solution
The authors develop an AI module that utilizes historical ED patient data to build a "patient similarity network", with patients as nodes and weighted edges denoting similarity based on vital signs and health data. This network is used to train a graph neural network classifier to categorize patients into standard triage severity levels. For new patients, the model can automatically suggest a triage code.

Key Contributions
- Novel strategy of modeling ED patients and their data as a graph network, allowing analysis of inter-patient similarities. This captures insights not evident in classical triage.

- Use of state-of-the-art graph representation learning techniques to embed this network into a latent space and enable predictive analytics.

- Formulation of triage code assignment as a node classification problem on the patient similarity graph. This allows accurate automated severity assessment of new patients.

- Demonstration of superior performance over traditional triage as well as classical ML approaches. Up to 10% test accuracy gains are reported.

- The inductive, GNN-based approach allows easy addition of new patient data without full retraining, enabling scalability.

In summary, the paper makes significant advances in automated ED triage by synergistically harnessing AI and network science to boost accuracy while reducing subjective errors. The graph-based pipeline offers interpretability and outperforms past systems.
