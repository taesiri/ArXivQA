# [Leveraging graph neural networks for supporting Automatic Triage of   Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07038)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the challenge of accurately prioritizing patients in emergency department (ED) triage. Traditional manual triage methods rely heavily on subjective human decisions, leading to inconsistencies and errors. The authors propose leveraging artificial intelligence and network science for automated, data-driven triage to minimize such issues.  

Proposed Solution
The authors develop an AI module that utilizes historical ED patient data to build a "patient similarity network", with patients as nodes and weighted edges denoting similarity based on vital signs and health data. This network is used to train a graph neural network classifier to categorize patients into standard triage severity levels. For new patients, the model can automatically suggest a triage code.

Key Contributions
- Novel strategy of modeling ED patients and their data as a graph network, allowing analysis of inter-patient similarities. This captures insights not evident in classical triage.

- Use of state-of-the-art graph representation learning techniques to embed this network into a latent space and enable predictive analytics.

- Formulation of triage code assignment as a node classification problem on the patient similarity graph. This allows accurate automated severity assessment of new patients.

- Demonstration of superior performance over traditional triage as well as classical ML approaches. Up to 10% test accuracy gains are reported.

- The inductive, GNN-based approach allows easy addition of new patient data without full retraining, enabling scalability.

In summary, the paper makes significant advances in automated ED triage by synergistically harnessing AI and network science to boost accuracy while reducing subjective errors. The graph-based pipeline offers interpretability and outperforms past systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel AI and network science approach for automatic patient triage in emergency departments, which models patients as graph nodes with edges representing similarity to embed them in a latent space for accurate severity classification using graph neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel AI-based approach for automatic patient triage in emergency departments, which involves:

1) Building a patient similarity network where each node represents a patient and edges represent similarity between patients based on their health data/features. Several similarity measures are used like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance etc.

2) Performing graph representation learning on this network to embed it into a latent space. State-of-the-art graph neural network methods like Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks and GraphSage are used for this.

3) Framing triage code assignment for new incoming patients as a node classification problem in the embedded graph. The model trained on historical patient data is used to predict the triage level for new patients.

4) Comprehensive experiments showing superior performance of the proposed technique over traditional triage methods as well as standard classification methods on tabular patient data. The results demonstrate the promise of this network science and AI based approach for improving accuracy of patient triage in emergency departments.

In summary, the key innovation is in modelling patient similarity as a network and using advanced graph deep learning methods to effectively exploit this structure for accurate patient triage.
