# [Prompt-Based Bias Calibration for Better Zero/Few-Shot Learning of   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Prompt-based learning with pre-trained language models (LMs) is susceptible to the intrinsic biases present in the LMs, resulting in sub-optimal performance for zero/few-shot learning. 
- Prior work on mitigating intrinsic bias focuses on social fairness and requires expensive data augmentation and retraining, which degrades language modeling abilities.
- Efficiently calibrating intrinsic bias in LMs to enhance downstream prompt-based learning performance remains an open problem.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a "null-input prompting" method to calibrate intrinsic bias in pre-trained masked LMs like RoBERTa.
- Leverage GPT-4 to auto-generate diverse null-meaning inputs (symbols, words, phrases) that contain no task-relevant information. Construct prompts by concatenating null inputs with an answer format.
- Select null inputs where the answer format has higher next sentence prediction probability for better integration.  
- Update only the bias parameters (0.1% of params) of LMs using KL divergence loss between output distribution on null prompts and uniform distribution.
- Use different early stopping criteria for zero-shot vs few-shot downstream tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce an efficient null-input prompting method to calibrate intrinsic bias in pre-trained Masked LMs to enhance downstream zero/few-shot prompt learning.
- Incorporate two key features - auto-generated null prompts and updating only bias parameters - for efficient calibration, preserving language modeling abilities.
- Experiments on 8 classification datasets with 4 prompt learning approaches show the calibration method significantly improves LM zero/few-shot performance for both in-context learning (9% on average) and prompt-based fine-tuning (2% on average).
- Analysis shows calibrated LMs demonstrate more equitable probability distribution on null inputs and improved separability for correct predictions.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient intrinsic bias calibration method for pre-trained LMs using auto-constructed null-input prompts and light model updates. Experiments confirm substantial gains in downstream zero/few-shot prompt learning scenarios while preserving language modeling abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method to calibrate the intrinsic bias in pre-trained language models using auto-generated null-input prompts and updating only the bias parameters, demonstrating improved performance for prompt-based zero/few-shot learning on downstream classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a null-input prompting method to calibrate the intrinsic bias of pre-trained masked language models, with the goal of improving their performance in downstream prompt-based zero/few-shot learning for text classification tasks. Specifically, the key aspects of their method include:

1) Automatically generating diverse null-meaning inputs using GPT-4 to construct null-input prompts for probing intrinsic bias in pre-trained LMs.

2) Updating only the bias parameters (which constitute less than 0.1% of total parameters) of LMs using a customized KL divergence loss to minimize distribution disparity, instead of fully updating the entire LM. This aims to achieve efficiency while preserving language modeling abilities. 

3) Demonstrating through experiments on multiple datasets that their proposed intrinsic bias calibration method significantly improves performance of in-context learning (on average 9% absolute) and prompt-based fine-tuning (on average 2% absolute) compared to uncalibrated LMs. The method also outperforms output calibration baselines.

In summary, the core contribution is an efficient null-input prompting approach to calibrate intrinsic bias in pre-trained LMs to make them better zero/few-shot learners in downstream prompt-based text classification.

The paper introduces a null-input prompting method to calibrate the intrinsic bias in pre-trained masked language models. The key goals are to improve the models' capabilities as zero/few-shot learners for downstream classification tasks, while emphasizing efficiency in the bias calibration process. Some critical aspects involve using auto-generated null-meaning inputs to probe bias, updating only the bias parameters of models, and developing early stopping criteria to prevent over-calibration. Experiments demonstrate significant gains in both in-context and prompt-based fine-tuning scenarios across several datasets.

In summary, the key terms revolve around efficient intrinsic bias calibration via null-input prompting to make language models better at prompt-based zero/few-shot learning.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

3. The paper uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantify the distribution disparity between the LM's output distribution conditioned on null inputs and the uniform distribution. What are the advantages of using KL divergence over other similarity/distance measures in this context?

5. The paper demonstrates selecting top null-meaning inputs based on next sentence prediction (NSP) scores with the answer format. How does this selection strategy for null inputs help improve calibration and downstream performance?

6. Could you analyze the trade-offs between updating the entire LM versus only the bias parameters during calibration? Under what conditions would one approach be preferred over the other? 

7. The paper shows that intrinsic bias calibration outperforms output calibration methods that are focused on counteracting bias at the prediction level. What limitations of output calibration methods does intrinsic bias calibration address?

8. How does the paper evaluate the impact of task-specific calibration on the general language modeling abilities of LMs? What do the results suggest about the effects of the proposed calibration method?

9. The paper focuses on classification tasks - both sentiment analysis and topic classification. Do you think the proposed method could be extended to other types of tasks like regression? Why or why not?

10. What directions for future work does the paper identify regarding intrinsic bias calibration of large language models? What open challenges need to be addressed?
