# [VoxelNeXt: Fully Sparse VoxelNet for 3D Object Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11301)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an efficient and elegant 3D object detection system that operates directly on sparse voxel features, without relying on hand-crafted proxies like anchors or object centers. 

The key hypothesis is that it is feasible and effective to predict 3D bounding boxes directly based on sparse voxel features, instead of converting the features to dense representations or using anchor boxes/object centers as intermediate targets.

The paper proposes VoxelNeXt, a sparse voxel-based 3D object detection and tracking framework, as an elegant solution that operates fully on sparse voxel features to validate this hypothesis. The main benefits are improved efficiency and simplified pipelines by avoiding dense conversions and hand-crafted proxies.

In summary, the central research question is whether direct sparse voxel-based prediction can work well for 3D object detection, in contrast to prevailing dense prediction frameworks. VoxelNeXt is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this sparse voxel-to-box scheme.
