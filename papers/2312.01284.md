# [Stable Messenger: Steganography for Message-Concealed Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior steganography works rely on bit accuracy metric which fails to assess if the entire hidden message is correctly retrieved. This overlooked practical usage where even minor errors in decoded messages can be problematic.  
- Conventional losses like MSE treat all predicted bits equally, providing uninformative gradients when most bits are correct. This limits optimization and message recovery.

Proposed Solutions:
1. Introduce "message accuracy" metric - only counts as correct if extracted message perfectly matches original. Emphasizes complete message retrieval.

2. Propose novel "Log-Sum-Exponential (LSE)" loss - prioritizes gradients from most incorrectly predicted bits, maintaining informative signal even if most bits correct. Significantly boosts entire message recovery.

3. Present latent-aware message encoding technique leveraging Stable Diffusion - encodes message compatible with image content latent code for better concealment without extra steps. Enables flexible usage for cover images or new generative image creation.

Main Contributions:

1. Message accuracy metric - shifts focus to practical needs of perfect whole message retrieval.

2. LSE loss - adaptable loss improving optimization and complete message accuracy across methods. 

3. Latent-aware encoding - seamless steganographic image creation, high capacity, visually imperceptible changes. Compatible generative image support.

The paper demonstrates superiority of the proposed LSE loss and latent-aware encoding over prior arts across datasets. Establishes strong benchmark for reliable and usable steganography aligned with real-world requirements. Overall evolvement of metrics, losses and encoding techniques.
