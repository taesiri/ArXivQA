# [Evaluation of Large Language Models for Decision Making in Autonomous   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06351)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Using large language models (LLMs) for autonomous driving is a promising approach, but their capabilities for spatial-aware decision making and adhering to traffic rules have not been quantitatively evaluated. 

- It is important to assess whether LLMs can accurately understand spatial relationships from coordinate information and make safe driving decisions.

- There is also a need to evaluate LLMs' ability to comprehend and follow traffic rules.

Methods:
- Simulations were created with highway driving scenarios to test LLMs on spatial-aware decision making, following traffic rules, and combinations of both. 

- Experiments were also conducted by deploying an LLM in an actual vehicle to navigate towards color cone objects based on human voice commands. A traffic officer was included to evaluate rule following abilities.

- Various LLMs were tested: LLaMA-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4

Results:
- In all experiments, GPT-4 showed significantly higher accuracy in decision making compared to other models.

- Requiring LLMs to provide reasoning improved accuracy for more advanced models. 

- In vehicle tests, GPT-4 could understand instructions to navigate towards specific cones and also stop when a traffic officer signaled to stop.

Conclusions:
- Advanced LLMs show promise for autonomous driving capabilities, but there are still challenges around real-time usage. 

- Balancing computational efficiency and accuracy is important.

- The results indicate that high LLM performance is crucial for reliability in autonomous driving tasks.

Main Contributions:
- First quantitative evaluation of LLMs for key autonomous driving capabilities: spatial-aware decision making and rule following
- Analysis of different LLMs' accuracies on these tasks
- Demonstration of using LLM to control real vehicle based on human commands and traffic signals


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper quantitatively evaluates the capabilities of different large language models for spatial-aware decision making and adhering to traffic rules in the context of autonomous driving, and demonstrates a proof-of-concept system using GPT-4 to operate a real vehicle.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper conducts a quantitative evaluation of two key capabilities needed for using large language models (LLMs) in autonomous driving: spatial-aware decision making (SADM) and following traffic rules (FTR). Experiments were conducted both in simulation and with actual vehicles.

2) The evaluation compares multiple LLMs - LLaMA-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 - on their performance on SADM and FTR tasks. The results show GPT-4 has significantly higher accuracy compared to the other models. 

3) As a proof of concept, the authors developed a real vehicle system that takes human instructions and object detections as inputs to an LLM which then outputs driving commands. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using LLMs for basic vehicle control.

4) The paper highlights the tradeoffs between computational efficiency and decision-making accuracy when using different LLMs for autonomous driving applications. More powerful models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieve higher accuracy but have challenges with real-time usage.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous benchmarking of LLMs on critical autonomous driving capabilities and an initial demonstration of using LLMs to control actual vehicles. The results provide insights into the feasibility and current limitations of employing LLMs for self-driving.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using separate perception and recognition modules along with the LLMs. Could you expand more on how these modules connect with the LLM? What information do they provide to the LLM?

2. In the simulation experiments, how were the datasets for evaluating spatial awareness and traffic rule following generated? Were they synthesized or based on real driving data? 

3. The paper tested performance with and without providing reasons for decisions. Could you discuss more about why giving reasons may improve performance, especially for more capable models? 

4. For the experiments with actual vehicles, how was safety ensured when giving control to the LLM? Were there any fallback systems or human overrides in place?

5. When deploying the LLMs in an actual vehicle, what were the practical challenges faced compared to simulation? How was real-time performance ensured?

6. The paper mentions the potential for using LLMs for ethical decision making in driving. Were any experiments done to test this capability specifically? If not, how could it be evaluated?  

7. How were the LLMs fine-tuned or conditioned before testing? Was domain-specific information provided to focus them on driving tasks?

8. What were limitations faced in generalizing the highway simulation setup to more complex urban driving environments? 

9. The paper tested only vision-based perception for vehicle experiments. How could LLMs leverage other modalities like lidar or radar data?

10. What directions could be explored to improve spatial awareness capabilities? Could graphical or 3D representations provide better performance?
