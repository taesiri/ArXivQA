This paper evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for autonomous driving applications. The authors focus on assessing two core abilities - spatial-aware decision making using coordinate information about surroundings, and following traffic rules. Experiments were conducted both in simulation and using actual vehicles. Three LLMs were tested - LLaMA, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The results showed that GPT-4 significantly outperformed the other models in accurately making driving decisions based on spatial context and rules, though its real-time usage faces computational challenges.
