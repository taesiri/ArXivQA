# [Evaluation of Large Language Models for Decision Making in Autonomous   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06351)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for autonomous driving applications. The authors focus on assessing two core abilities - spatial-aware decision making using coordinate information about surroundings, and following traffic rules. Experiments were conducted both in simulation and using actual vehicles. Three LLMs were tested - LLaMA, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The results showed that GPT-4 significantly outperformed the other models in accurately making driving decisions based on spatial context and rules, though its real-time usage faces computational challenges. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art LLMs for autonomous driving systems, if challenges around precision and efficiency can be addressed. The authors argue advanced LLMs have the generalization capabilities to comprehend unfamiliar driving scenarios. As a proof-of-concept, they developed a system using GPT-4 to successfully operate a real vehicle based on human commands and visual input.
