# [Wavelet Scattering Transform for Bioacustics: Application to Watkins   Marine Mammal Sound Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17775)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Marine mammal communication is complex and difficult to analyze due to diversity of vocalizations, behaviors, and environmental factors. 
- The Watkins Marine Mammal Sound Database (WMMD) is an extensive labeled dataset of marine mammal vocalizations used in machine learning, but methods for data preparation, preprocessing, and classification are disparate.
- Current benchmarks rely heavily on deep learning or peculiar data preparation and preprocessing methods. 
- Most works tackle only portions of the full dataset, with few classes or the "best of" subset. 
- Main preprocessing methods are based on Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).

Proposed Solution:
- Provide a detailed and public pipeline for data preparation of WMMD, accenting use of Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) as alternative preprocessing.
- WST has translation invariance, stability to deformations, resistance to noise compared to STFT.
- Apply WST on marine mammal vocalizations dataset.
- Propose deep architecture with residual layers for classification task.

Main Contributions:
- Review of data preparation, preprocessing and classification methods for WMMD
- Detailed public pipeline for data preparation of WMMD dataset
- Introduction of WST as alternative preprocessing method instead of standard STFT-based techniques 
- Deep architecture with residual layers for classification, achieving 94% (WST) and 96% (Mel spectrogram) accuracy
- Surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy by 6-8% on full WMMD dataset, halving misclassifications

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed WST preprocessing and deep learning solution, and highlights the main contributions in preparing the dataset, using WST, and significantly improving classification accuracy over benchmarks on the full WMMD dataset.
