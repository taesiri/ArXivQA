# [Adaptive Inference: Theoretical Limits and Unexplored Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inference with large neural network models is very computationally expensive, leading to high economic and environmental costs. However, existing network compression and efficiency enhancement techniques have reached a plateau. 
- Adaptive inference methods that can dynamically adjust model complexity based on input difficulty have potential for further improvements but current approaches are ad-hoc without a comprehensive framework.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a theoretical framework to analyze adaptive inference systems using the concept of an "Adaptive Oracle" which has perfect knowledge to select the optimal model for each input. 
- Derive approximate and exact bounds on best possible efficiency and performance gains achievable to quantify potential of adaptive methods.
- Provide design guidelines to improve adaptation opportunities by careful selection of models spanning the adaptation state space.

Key Contributions:
- First theoretical quantification of efficiency/performance gains feasible with adaptive inference, using adaptive oracles. 
- New metrics introduced - efficiency gain opportunity, performance gain opportunity.
- Empirical evaluation showing 10-100x efficiency gains possible for image classification and NLP tasks without losing performance.
- Analysis revealing optimal model selection and state space design choices to maximize adaptation potential. 
- Adaptation "ground truth" labels provided for two datasets across multiple models to guide future research.

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution by establishing a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing and systematically designing adaptive inference systems to unlock substantial efficiency gains. The empirical findings and design guidelines also showcase promising potential, motivating further research into adaptive methods.
