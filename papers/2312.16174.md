# [Industrial Internet of Things Intelligence Empowering Smart   Manufacturing: A Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The manufacturing industry is facing pressures to transform digitally due to rising labor costs, demand for customization, competitive pressures, and technology advances. Existing research on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and intelligence has focused narrowly on specific technologies, failing to provide a systematic understanding. There is a need for a comprehensive overview of IIoT intelligence and how it drives smart manufacturing transformation.

Solution:
This paper provides a holistic literature review of IIoT intelligence and proposes a hierarchical development architecture consisting of five layers - equipment, networking, software, modeling, and analysis/optimization. 

The paper first explains the inevitability and secrets of smart manufacturing transformation based on practical industry experiences. It then defines IIoT intelligence and demonstrates its value in enhancing manufacturing functions, operations, deployment, and applications.  

The proposed architecture provides a systematic understanding of how IIoT intelligence handles manufacturing transformation issues. Each layer has distinct missions, technologies, and value. Interactions between layers fully enhance manufacturing intelligence. The architecture is combined with real-world lighthouse factory examples to showcase the benefits.

The paper also identifies seven key enabling technologies - industrial robots, machine vision, networking, digital twins, deep learning, smart hardware, and cloud/edge computing - and elaborates their acceleration effects on IIoT intelligence.

Finally, open challenges and future trends are discussed around four aspects: achieving digital control via digital twins, ensuring deterministic system response, optimizing cost-friendly operation/deployment, and enabling intelligence proliferation.

Main Contributions:

- Comprehensive literature review of IIoT intelligence to establish a systematic understanding of its transformative impact on smart manufacturing

- Proposal of a five-layer hierarchical development architecture for IIoT intelligence demonstrated through lighthouse factory examples 

- Identification and elaboration of seven key technologies accelerating IIoT intelligence  

- Exploration of open challenges and future trends in digital control, deterministic response, cost optimization, and intelligence proliferation

The paper delivers valuable insights, framework, and research directions for both industry and academia to advance IIoT intelligence and reap the benefits of smart manufacturing transformation.
