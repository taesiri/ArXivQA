# [Betting on what is neither verifiable nor falsifiable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14021)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional prediction markets can only handle bets on claims that will be empirically verified or falsified at a fixed point in time. However, there are many meaningful claims, especially in mathematics and logic, that do not have a clear empirical resolution. 
- The paper considers First Order Logic (FOL) sentences which include claims with quantifiers like "for all x" or "there exists an x." These cannot be directly handled by traditional prediction markets.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new prediction market framework based on Hintikka's game semantics. In this, the claim is modeled as a game between a "verifier" trying to verify the claim and a "falsifier" trying to show it is false. 
- Traders bet on which player they think would win such a game. The moves allowed follow the rules of FOL so traders are essentially betting on the constructive truth or falsifiability of the sentence.
- A market mechanism is devised where agents can trade securities representing the options to play such verification-falsification games. Prices and allocations converge over time.

Main Contributions:
- Defines a new notion of "constructive truth" for FOL sentences based on outcomes of the verification-falsification game.
- Proves market prices learn to distinguish between constructively true and false sentences. 
- Provides a foundation to apply ideas of prediction markets and game semantics to problems in logic, theory choice, and reasoning about subjective claims.
- Conceptually links to philosophy of mathematics (constructivism) and long-term challenges around markets estimating subjective latent variables.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel prediction market framework to handle meaningful claims beyond those directly empirically verifiable, with applications ranging from logic and reasoning to machine intelligence.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a prediction market framework for betting on sentences in first-order logic, based on Hintikka's game semantics, where traders pay to play verification-falsification games.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a prediction market framework for betting on sentences in first-order logic (FOL). Specifically:

- The paper introduces a market mechanism based on Hintikka's verification-falsification game semantics, where traders bet on their ability to play this game for FOL sentences against an opponent. The price of a sentence represents how much traders are willing to pay to play the game for that sentence.

- The paper proves some key theoretical results about this market, including:
  - It is inexpoitable (no trader can make unbounded profit) 
  - Prices converge over time
  - The market learns to price sentences according to a "constructivist" notion of truth based on computable winning strategies in the verification-falsification game

- The paper discusses applications of this approach to logical uncertainty, bounded rationality, and measuring the strength of mathematical theories. It also suggests this could be a step towards betting on "latent variables" that have no direct empirical basis but provide useful signal about correlated empirical events.

So in summary, the key contribution is introducing a novel prediction market for FOL sentences based on game semantics, along with some theoretical results about its properties and potential applications. The paper proposes this as a new approach distinct from existing methods for logical uncertainty.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Prediction markets - The paper discusses designing prediction markets that can handle logical/mathematical sentences beyond just empirical claims with a definite resolution time.

- First-order logic (FOL) - The framework aims to allow betting on sentences that can be expressed in first-order logic, which includes things like mathematical statements. 

- Game semantics - The proposed market is based on Hintikka's game semantics, where sentences are associated with a verification-falsification game between players.

- Constructivism - The notion of "truth" that the market learns is related to constructivism in the philosophy of mathematics, where a statement is considered true if there exists a constructive proof or winning strategy for it.

- Exploitability - A key property is that the market pricing is not exploitable, i.e. no trader can make unbounded profits.

- Convergence - It is proven that market prices converge over time for all sentences considered.

- Computability limitations - Results show fundamental limitations in being able to learn arbitrary logical truths, based on computability considerations.

Some other potentially relevant terms include arithmetic hierarchy, logical induction, bounded rationality, quantitative semantics, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask to better understand the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the proposed framework of prediction markets based on verification-falsification games compare to existing approaches for assigning probabilities to logical sentences, such as Garrabrant induction? What are the key advantages and limitations? 

2) The paper notes that the framework does not provide incentives for agents to bet prices up to their subjective probabilities. What notions of truth and optimal betting behavior does it incentivize instead? How does this relate to constructivism in philosophy of mathematics?

3) What are some of the subtleties involved in formally defining the players, labeling schemes, and aggregate agents in the market framework? How do design choices impact theoretical results like exploitability?  

4) What considerations need to be made in implementing such prediction markets practically, especially regarding computational asymmetries between players? How can the separation of markets for players and probabilities help address this?

5) How can the framework be adapted to provide a measure of the deductive strength of a mathematical theory, by analyzing the wealth accumulation of traders restricted to that theory? What theoretical results support this notion?  

6) How do the market convergence results change if the space of possible agents/players is expanded to more expressive computability classes beyond polynomial time? What barriers exist to convergence in more expansive markets?

7) Can connections be made between the limiting price distributions and existing formalisms like quantifier algebras, game-theoretic probability, and computability logic? Might new probability formalisms need to be developed?

8) Does the constructivist truth concept generalize nicely to heuristics for solving decision problems beyond provability, like optimization heuristics? If so, how might markets identify useful heuristics?

9) What modifications could enable betting directly on latent variables not empirically grounded? What roles would such a system serve in developing general intelligence?  

10) Can practical systems be developed that approximate the theoreticalPrediction Markets presented here? What challenges need to be overcome? How might we test performance empirically?
