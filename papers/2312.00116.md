# [S2ST: Image-to-Image Translation in the Seed Space of Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on unpaired image-to-image translation (I2IT), which refers to transforming images from a source domain to a target domain without using aligned image pairs for training. The paper notes that recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown success in I2IT but still struggle with translations requiring high precision, such as day-to-night or clear-to-rain translations of complex automotive scenes. 

Approach: 
The paper proposes a new approach called S2ST (Seed-to-Seed Translation) for I2IT using diffusion models. S2ST operates within the seed space of a latent diffusion model (LDM), leveraging the image priors learned by the LDM. It performs I2IT through two main steps:

1) Seed translation: The LDM seed corresponding to the input image is optimized to translate it to the target domain while enforcing structural similarity between the input and output images through a structure loss.  

2) Trajectory optimization: The sampling trajectory from the translated seed to the final output image is further optimized using the original seed's inversion trajectory as reference, enhancing structural similarity.

Contributions:
1) Proposes S2ST, a diffusion-based I2IT method for global image manipulations requiring high fidelity.

2) Uses seed translation and trajectory optimization to achieve photorealistic target domain appearance while retaining structure/content. 

3) Compares to GAN I2IT methods quantitatively and qualitatively, showing improved performance on day-to-night automotive translations.

4) Eliminates the need to train separate networks per domain pair for translation.

The key advantages are better learning of subtle domain differences via diffusion priors, flexible use for multi-domain translation, and content/structure preservation without requiring cycle consistency constraints.
