# [ExMap: Leveraging Explainability Heatmaps for Unsupervised Group   Robustness to Spurious Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most methods for improving model robustness to spurious correlations rely on having access to group labels (e.g. gender, background scene) in the training and/or validation data. However, these labels are often unavailable in real-world scenarios.  
- Existing unsupervised methods generate pseudo-labels by clustering raw image features. However, these features may contain irrelevant information not related to the classification task.

Proposed Solution:
- ExMap: An unsupervised two-stage approach to generate pseudo-labels for group robustness without needing real group labels.  
- Stage 1: Extract pixel-level relevance scores ("heatmaps") from a trained model using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). These focus only on image regions relevant to the classification.  
- Stage 2: Cluster the heatmaps using spectral clustering to identify dominant model prediction strategies. Use the cluster assignments as pseudo-group labels.
- These pseudo-labels can then be used with any existing group robustness method that relies on group labels.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate superior performance over prior unsupervised methods like GEORGE across several datasets with single spurious shortcuts. Also effective on a dataset with multiple simultaneous shortcuts.
- Analysis showing heatmaps are more useful for pseudo-labeling than raw image features since they discard irrelevant information.
- Ablation studies validating robustness of approach to choice of clustering algorithm and group robustness training strategy.
- Qualitative visualizations of heatmaps providing insight into how ExMap uncovers model shortcut strategies.
- Simple but effective strategy-agnostic approach to enable unsupervised group robustness.
