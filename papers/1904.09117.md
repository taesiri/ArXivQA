# [SelFlow: Self-Supervised Learning of Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09117)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Is it possible to effectively learn optical flow with occlusions in a self-supervised manner from unlabeled data? The key hypotheses are:1) Accurate optical flow estimations can be distilled from non-occluded pixels and used to guide learning for occluded pixels. 2) Synthetic occlusions can be created by perturbing superpixels with noise to enable self-supervised learning.3) Temporal information from multiple frames can help improve flow prediction within a simple CNN architecture. The paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach for optical flow that addresses the challenge of occlusions. It tests the hypotheses through experiments on benchmark datasets like Sintel and KITTI. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show superior performance compared to prior unsupervised and supervised methods.In summary, the central research question is about developing an unsupervised learning approach for optical flow that can handle occlusions effectively. The key hypotheses focus on using non-occluded pixels as guidance, creating synthetic occlusions, and using multi-frame information. The experiments validate these hypotheses and show state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a self-supervised learning approach for optical flow estimation that can effectively handle occlusions. The key ideas are:- They train two models - a NOC model that focuses on estimating flow for non-occluded pixels, and an OCC model that estimates flow for all pixels. - The NOC model predictions on non-occluded pixels are used as "ground truth" to supervise the OCC model on those pixels when they are artificially occluded through noise injection. This allows the OCC model to learn to estimate flow for occluded pixels.- They use superpixel noise injection to create realistic synthetic occlusions during training.- A simple CNN architecture is used to aggregate temporal information from multiple frames.The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised optical flow learning methods on MPI Sintel and KITTI benchmarks. The self-supervised pre-training also leads to excellent performance when fine-tuned with ground truth flow, achieving top results on these benchmarks.In summary, the key contribution is a self-supervised learning approach to handle a key challenge in optical flow (occlusions), leading to unprecedented performance for unsupervised and supervised learning of optical flow.
