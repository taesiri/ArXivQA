# [Grounded Text-to-Image Synthesis with Attention Refocusing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05427)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can grounded text-to-image synthesis be improved by refocusing attention using explicit layout representations?The key hypothesis appears to be:By using novel losses to refocus attention in the cross-attention and self-attention layers of diffusion models during sampling, and by generating explicit layout representations using large language models, the controllability and fidelity of grounded text-to-image synthesis can be substantially improved.In particular, the paper proposes two novel losses - Cross-Attention Refocusing (CAR) and Self-Attention Refocusing (SAR) - that aim to recalibrate the attention maps according to a given layout during sampling. The paper also explores using large language models like GPT-4 to generate bounding box layouts from text prompts. The central hypothesis seems to be that by combining explicit layout representations from LLMs with the proposed attention refocusing losses, text-to-image generation can be significantly improved in terms of aligning the generated images with the text prompts and specified layouts. The key research goals are developing the attention losses for improving alignment, and showing that LLMs can produce useful layout representations from text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:1. The paper proposes two novel losses - Cross-Attention Refocusing (CAR) and Self-Attention Refocusing (SAR) - to improve the alignment of generated images with input text prompts that contain multiple objects and complex spatial relationships. 2. The CAR loss helps "refocus" the cross-attention maps to attend more to the corresponding region specified by the layout (bounding boxes). The SAR loss serves a similar purpose for the self-attention maps.3. The paper demonstrates how large language models like GPT-4 can be used to generate bounding box layouts from text prompts. This allows exploiting powerful up-to-date LLMs with existing pre-trained text-to-image models without retraining them.4. The paper provides comprehensive experiments showing that the proposed losses consistently improve various text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, etc. on benchmark datasets. The losses help enhance the controllability and alignment of generated images with the given text prompts and layouts.5. The overall framework combines layout generation using LLMs and attention-based guidance via the proposed losses to significantly improve the consistency between input text prompts and the synthesized images compared to prior arts.In summary, the key contribution is a novel attention regularization approach during sampling to improve alignment with input text and layouts, along with using LLMs for layout generation. This enhances the controllability of text-to-image synthesis without retraining models.
