# [Grounded Text-to-Image Synthesis with Attention Refocusing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05427)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can grounded text-to-image synthesis be improved by refocusing attention using explicit layout representations?The key hypothesis appears to be:By using novel losses to refocus attention in the cross-attention and self-attention layers of diffusion models during sampling, and by generating explicit layout representations using large language models, the controllability and fidelity of grounded text-to-image synthesis can be substantially improved.In particular, the paper proposes two novel losses - Cross-Attention Refocusing (CAR) and Self-Attention Refocusing (SAR) - that aim to recalibrate the attention maps according to a given layout during sampling. The paper also explores using large language models like GPT-4 to generate bounding box layouts from text prompts. The central hypothesis seems to be that by combining explicit layout representations from LLMs with the proposed attention refocusing losses, text-to-image generation can be significantly improved in terms of aligning the generated images with the text prompts and specified layouts. The key research goals are developing the attention losses for improving alignment, and showing that LLMs can produce useful layout representations from text.
