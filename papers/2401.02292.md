# [GridFormer: Point-Grid Transformer for Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "GridFormer: Point-Grid Transformer for Surface Reconstruction":

Problem:
- Surface reconstruction from point clouds is challenging as there is a gap between the continuous representation of space and the discrete points. 
- Existing methods typically encode points into regular grid features by uniformly scattering point features. However, grid features may lose details while point features are irregular and inefficient. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose GridFormer, a novel Point-Grid Transformer attention mechanism to bridge space and points. 
- Treats grid as transfer points to connect space and points. Learns relationships between input points and grids to capture spatial details efficiently.
- Uses UNet-like encoder-decoder structure. Encoder aggregates point features into grid features using point-grid attention. Decoder samples query features from grids.

Main Contributions:
- Point-Grid Transformer attention mechanism to maximize spatial expressiveness of grids while maintaining efficiency.
- Two-stage training strategy with margin binary cross-entropy loss and boundary sampling to optimize predictions near surface.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on object and scene reconstruction. Reconstructs smoother and more detailed surfaces.
- Attention-based encoder reduces time and memory compared to other attention-based decoders.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel GridFormer method using Point-Grid Transformer attention to bridge space and points for high quality surface reconstruction from point clouds. A two-stage training strategy further refines the surface prediction.
