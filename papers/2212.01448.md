# [PGFed: Personalize Each Client's Global Objective for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01448)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can personalized federated learning algorithms more explicitly and efficiently transfer collaborative knowledge across clients to improve model generalization?The key points I gathered are:- Most existing personalized federated learning (FL) algorithms implicitly transfer collaborative knowledge by embedding it into model aggregation or regularization. - The authors propose that more explicitly involving multiple clients' risks in each client's objective could improve generalization, but requires prohibitive O(N^2) communication costs.- To address this, the authors propose PGFed, a novel personalized FL algorithm that enables each client to formulate a "personalized global objective" by adaptively aggregating its own and others' risks. - PGFed circumvents the high communication costs by using first-order approximations to estimate non-local risks for each client.- Experiments show PGFed improves generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art personalized FL algorithms.In summary, the central hypothesis is that more explicit risk aggregation can improve personalized model generalization in FL, and the authors propose an efficient way to achieve this with PGFed.
