# [PGFed: Personalize Each Client's Global Objective for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01448)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can personalized federated learning algorithms more explicitly and efficiently transfer collaborative knowledge across clients to improve model generalization?

The key points I gathered are:

- Most existing personalized federated learning (FL) algorithms implicitly transfer collaborative knowledge by embedding it into model aggregation or regularization. 

- The authors propose that more explicitly involving multiple clients' risks in each client's objective could improve generalization, but requires prohibitive O(N^2) communication costs.

- To address this, the authors propose PGFed, a novel personalized FL algorithm that enables each client to formulate a "personalized global objective" by adaptively aggregating its own and others' risks. 

- PGFed circumvents the high communication costs by using first-order approximations to estimate non-local risks for each client.

- Experiments show PGFed improves generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art personalized FL algorithms.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that more explicit risk aggregation can improve personalized model generalization in FL, and the authors propose an efficient way to achieve this with PGFed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It uncovers that the explicitness of a personalized federated learning (FL) algorithm empowers it with stronger adaptation ability. The paper shows through an empirical study that directly involving multiple clients' empirical risks in the local objective (an explicit way) leads to better adaptation performance compared to just using the local risk (an implicit way). 

2. It proposes a novel explicit personalized FL algorithm called PGFed that enables each client to formulate its local objective as a "personalized global objective". This allows explicit aggregation of multiple clients' risks without massive communication costs by using first-order approximations of the non-local risks.

3. It further proposes PGFedMo, an upgrade to PGFed using momentum to efficiently utilize risks from clients who are not participating in the current round. 

4. Extensive experiments on four datasets under different federated settings demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed PGFed and PGFedMo over state-of-the-art personalized FL methods, with up to 15.47% boost in accuracy.

In summary, the key novelty and contribution is proposing an explicit way to transfer global collaborative knowledge in personalized FL without incurring huge communication overhead. This is achieved through the personalized global objectives and the non-local risk estimations. Both PGFed and PGFedMo consistently outperform previous personalized FL methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel personalized federated learning framework called PGFed that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by explicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other clients, avoiding massive communication overhead through first-order approximation of non-local risks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my summary of how this paper compares to other research in federated learning:

This paper proposes a new personalized federated learning framework called PGFed that enables clients to explicitly incorporate other clients' risks into their local objectives. This is a novel approach compared to most prior personalized federated learning methods, which typically only transfer knowledge between clients implicitly through model aggregation or regularization terms. 

The key innovation of PGFed is the formulation of the local objective as a "personalized global objective" that is a weighted sum of the client's own risk and estimates of other clients' risks. To avoid the high communication costs of sharing full risks, PGFed uses first-order Taylor approximations. This explicit risk sharing allows for more efficient adaptation and stronger generalization compared to implicit methods.

Prior personalized federated learning algorithms like LG-FedAvg, FedRep, Per-FedAvg, etc. focus on techniques like layer-wise aggregation, meta-learning, and fine-tuning. But they only transfer knowledge implicitly and do not enable clients to directly optimize for other clients' objectives. 

PGFed is the first method to explicitly expose clients to each other's risks in a personalized way, while keeping communication manageable. Experiments show substantial improvements in accuracy over prior state-of-the-art personalized algorithms.

In summary, PGFed introduces a novel explicit risk sharing approach to personalized federated learning that outperforms prior work and enables more efficient adaptation to local data distributions. The personalized global objectives and first-order approximations are innovative techniques not explored by previous methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Extending the proposed framework by combining it with existing implicit federated learning algorithms that focus on model aggregation or different local regularizers. The authors point out that since their proposed approach is agnostic, it could potentially be combined with other implicit methods.

- Investigating more communication-efficient methods. The authors acknowledge that although their method avoids the O(N^2) communication cost, it still incurs higher communication than vanilla FedAvg. So developing ways to further reduce communication overhead is an area for future work.

- Studying whether the proposed explicit auxiliary risk aggregation approach can achieve better convergence rates theoretically in addition to empirically. The authors did not provide theoretical convergence analysis. 

- Releasing code and models to facilitate reproducibility, comparisons, and extensions of the method by other researchers. The authors mention they will release their implementation code on GitHub.

- Evaluating the method on more diverse and larger-scale federated datasets. The experiments were limited to a few benchmark datasets. Testing on more real-world federated datasets could further demonstrate the effectiveness.

- Exploring privacy-preserving extensions of the approach to protect against reconstruction of user data. The method involves sharing model updates which could potentially leak private information.

- Investigating approaches to handle systems heterogeneity in addition to statistical heterogeneity. The authors focused on statistical heterogeneity but systems heterogeneity also poses challenges.

In summary, the main future directions are improving communication efficiency, theoretical analysis, more extensive empirical evaluation, ensuring privacy, handling systems heterogeneity, and combining the approach with complementary federated learning algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel personalized federated learning framework called PGFed that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by explicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other clients. Unlike most existing personalized FL algorithms where collaborative knowledge is transferred implicitly through model aggregation or regularization, PGFed allows direct engagement with multiple clients' risks to improve model generalization. To avoid the high communication costs of transmitting risks between all clients, PGFed uses first-order approximations to estimate non-local risks. Experiments on benchmark datasets under different federated settings show consistent improvements of PGFed over state-of-the-art alternatives, with up to 15.47% higher accuracy. The momentum upgrade PGFedMo further boosts performance by more efficiently utilizing clients' empirical risks. Overall, the explicit risk aggregation in PGFed enables stronger adaptation and better local performance compared to implicit personalization schemes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new personalized federated learning framework called PGFed that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by explicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other clients. Unlike previous personalized federated learning methods that only implicitly transfer collaborative knowledge through model aggregation or regularization, PGFed allows direct engagement with multiple clients' risks to improve model generalization. To avoid the high communication costs normally required for this direct engagement, PGFed uses a first-order Taylor approximation to estimate each client's risk contribution to the others' objectives. Building on top of PGFed, the authors also propose PGFedMo which adds a momentum term to allow clients to accumulate and utilize empirical risk from non-selected clients over multiple rounds. 

Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements from PGFed and PGFedMo over previous state-of-the-art personalized federated learning algorithms on four benchmark datasets under different federated settings. The gains in accuracy over the compared methods reached up to 15.47%, showing the benefits of explicit risk aggregation for personalization. Additional analyses provide insights into the convergence behavior, coefficient matrix updates, and generalizability to new clients. Overall, the proposed methods advance personalized federated learning through an explicit yet efficient transfer of collaborative knowledge among clients.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel personalized federated learning framework called PGFed that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by explicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other clients. To avoid the massive O(N^2) communication overhead of acquiring all clients' risks, PGFed estimates each client's non-local risks through a first-order Taylor approximation around the other clients' models. This allows each client to receive an auxiliary risk that approximates the weighted sum of all other clients' risks. The local objective is then trained via gradient descent on the local empirical risk plus this auxiliary risk. In this way, PGFed transfers collaborative knowledge among clients explicitly without incurring huge communication costs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It is addressing the problem of mediocre performance of conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms like FedAvg on heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions across clients. 

- It observes that existing personalized FL algorithms only implicitly transfer collaborative knowledge across clients by embedding it into model aggregation or regularization. 

- The paper proposes that explicitly involving multiple clients' risks in each client's local objective can improve model generalization and adaptation to local data.

- To avoid the high communication cost of explicit risk aggregation, the paper presents PGFed, which estimates the risks using Taylor expansion.

- PGFed formulates each client's objective as a "personalized global objective", explicitly aggregating local and non-local risks. 

- This is achieved without the high $O(N^2)$ communication cost or privacy risks of transmitting risks between clients.

- Experiments show PGFed outperforms state-of-the-art personalized FL methods, improving accuracy by up to 15.47% on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the key focus is improving personalization and generalization in federated learning on non-IID data by using explicit risk aggregation through approximation, without high communication costs.
