# [EventRL: Enhancing Event Extraction with Outcome Supervision for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in event extraction tasks, including mismatches in event structure (incorrectly extracting arguments) and generating undefined event types not specified in the guidelines. These issues manifest as problems in instruction following and hallucination. Existing methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fail to effectively address these challenges.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes EventRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework to enhance event extraction in LLMs. EventRL incorporates outcome supervision by utilizing specialized reward functions that focus on the accuracy of extracted event structures and types. This provides more targeted and precise feedback to guide policy updates during training. Three key reward functions are explored: Argument-F1, Average-F1, and Product-F1. Furthermore, EventRL implements two stabilization strategies - Teacher-Force Threshold and Advantage Clipping - to mitigate policy degradation and catastrophic forgetting.

Main Contributions:
1) First work to introduce outcome supervision through reinforcement learning for event extraction in LLMs, directing attention to event comprehension.
2) Development of EventRL framework with tailored reward functions and stabilization techniques to significantly boost performance.
3) Extensive experiments demonstrate EventRL's superior performance over SFT and few-shot prompting across various LLMs. Significant gains shown in handling unseen events and reducing structural/type errors.
4) Analysis provides insights into: (i) impact of different reward functions (ii) benefits of leveraging code data (iii) tradeoffs in model scaling for generalization.

In summary, the paper makes seminal contributions in advancing event extraction for LLMs by incorporating outcome feedback to enhance event understanding. EventRL effectively handles limitations of existing methods by directly targeting instruction following and hallucination issues that impede reliability in event extraction.
