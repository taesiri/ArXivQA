# [DART: Implicit Doppler Tomography for Radar Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03896)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Simulating realistic radar scans is challenging as it requires accurate models of the scene geometry, radio frequency material properties, and a corresponding radar synthesis function. Manually creating such models is impractical. Instead, the paper proposes a data-driven approach to learn a model suitable for accurate radar simulation using only radar measurements of a scene.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents Doppler-Aided Radar Tomography (DART), a neural radiance field-inspired method for novel view synthesis of radar range-Doppler images. DART represents the world with neural implicit functions that output a reflectance and transmittance for each point in space, modeled in a view-dependent manner using spherical harmonics. It formulates a radar rendering equation that integrates samples along a velocity-dependent circle corresponding to each range-Doppler bin. DART is trained on input radar scans to invert this rendering function and implicitly learn a model of scene geometry and radar properties that can generate realistic radar images from new views.

Key Contributions:
- Formulates radar novel view synthesis using transmittance and reflectance maps learned from range-Doppler images 
- Derives a physically-based differentiable radar rendering equation for range-Doppler images
- Constructs a radar data collection platform with accurate position and instantaneous velocity
- Collects novel multimodal radar datasets with lidar scans as reference
- Achieves superior quantitative and qualitative performance over baselines in radar image synthesis
- Demonstrates high quality radar tomographic maps that capture scene properties not visible to other sensors

The key insight is to leverage radar-specific Doppler processing and implicit scene modeling to achieve realistic radar view synthesis without needing explicit environment models. DART could enable simulations for radar algorithm development and unlock radar-based mapping/localization algorithms.
