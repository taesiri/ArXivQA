# [A Note on Bias to Complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11710)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social bias in language models leads to unfairness, misunderstandings, and divisions in society. However, existing methods for detecting and mitigating bias have several limitations:
1) Bias is defined in an absolute and superficial way without considering context 
2) Quantifying bias fails to account for social norms and connotations  
3) Current debiasing methods can be impractical and sometimes introduce injustice
4) Obtaining labeled bias data is challenging
5) The link between mis/disinformation and bias is understudied

Proposed Solutions:  
To address these limitations, the authors propose a framework with 8 hypotheses about bias. For each hypothesis, they suggest novel NLP methods focused on 5 key areas:

1) Define bias in a relative way based on cultural context using tensor analysis 
2) Quantify bias by understanding social norms, connotations, and perspectives
3) Generate synthetic labeled bias data via machine translation 
4) Mitigate bias by analyzing root causes, removing biased features, and controlling for perspectives
5) Study the influence of mis/disinformation on bias

Main Contributions:
- New concepts of relative and contextual bias
- A theory relating 8 hypotheses about bias in LLMs  
- Classification of 8 bias types (context, language, connotation, position, data, algorithmic, topic, intention)
- Innovative techniques leveraging tensor networks, machine translation, social norms, etc. to realize the framework
- Methods and products for defining, quantifying, augmenting, mitigating, and explaining bias in LLMs as well as analyzing the role of mis/disinformation

The main goal is to "embrace bias to mitigate bias" by modeling a spectrum of perspectives to enable LLMs to reach more objective conclusions about sensitive issues.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework with 8 hypotheses to redefine and measure bias in language models relative to dynamic contexts, and offers 5 methods to mitigate different types of biases using techniques like tensor factorization, machine translation, social norm analysis, and controlling mis/disinformation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

Proposing a new framework for understanding and minimizing bias in large language models (LLMs). The key aspects of this framework include:

1) Introducing the concept of "relative bias" that depends on the context rather than viewing bias as absolute. This includes developing metrics to quantify bias relative to cultural norms and standards that vary across different contexts.

2) Categorizing different types of biases - context bias, language bias, connotation bias, etc. - and proposing targeted methods to address each one.

3) Putting forth 8 hypotheses related to how bias manifests in LLMs and communication. The methods aim to verify these hypotheses.  

4) Proposing 5 specific methods to: define, quantify, generate data for, mitigate, and analyze bias, as well as study the interplay between bias and mis/disinformation.

5) Using techniques like tensor analysis, machine translation, analyzing social norms, controlling for protected attributes, etc. to realize the goals of minimizing bias.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive contextual framework to understand and reduce bias in LLMs using novel concepts, categorizations, hypotheses, and methods. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a "Contextualized bias definition with contrastive perspectives" (M1). Can you elaborate on what is meant by "contrastive perspectives" here? How does considering contrastive perspectives lead to a more contextualized definition of bias?

2. One key innovation claimed is the concept of "relative bias" that depends on context. Can you explain this concept in more detail? How is it different from previous definitions of bias that were more "absolute"? 

3. The paper categorizes 8 different types of biases such as context bias, language bias, etc. Can you explain the difference between some of these bias types? For example, how does topic bias differ from data bias?

4. The paper proposes a "Bias No Effect on Performance Assumption". What does this assumption state and why is it an important assumption to make in the context of this work? What are some ways you could test the validity of this assumption?

5. One proposed solution is "Data generation using machine translation" (M3). Can you explain how debiasing is framed as a machine translation task in this approach? What are the source and target languages/representations?

6. The paper claims embracing bias is key to mitigating bias. Can you explain this counterintuitive concept and the reasoning behind it? What are some potential limitations or pitfalls of this embracing bias strategy?  

7. Can you critically analyze the "LowGram Phenomenon Assumption"? Do you think this assumption holds true in reality? What evidence is there to support or refute this assumption?

8. What are some real-world use cases where the proposed contextualized definition and relative notion of bias could be especially beneficial? When might a more absolute bias definition still be preferred?

9. One proposed innovation is using tensor networks for context modeling. What are some challenges in using tensor networks at scale for this problem? How could the tensor factorization approach deal with sparsity in contextual dependencies? 

10. The paper claims to lead to "products" for debiasing LLMs. What would a minimum viable product look like based on this work? What key functionalities would it need to have to be considered successful?
