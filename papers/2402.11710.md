# [A Note on Bias to Complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11710)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social bias in language models leads to unfairness, misunderstandings, and divisions in society. However, existing methods for detecting and mitigating bias have several limitations:
1) Bias is defined in an absolute and superficial way without considering context 
2) Quantifying bias fails to account for social norms and connotations  
3) Current debiasing methods can be impractical and sometimes introduce injustice
4) Obtaining labeled bias data is challenging
5) The link between mis/disinformation and bias is understudied

Proposed Solutions:  
To address these limitations, the authors propose a framework with 8 hypotheses about bias. For each hypothesis, they suggest novel NLP methods focused on 5 key areas:

1) Define bias in a relative way based on cultural context using tensor analysis 
2) Quantify bias by understanding social norms, connotations, and perspectives
3) Generate synthetic labeled bias data via machine translation 
4) Mitigate bias by analyzing root causes, removing biased features, and controlling for perspectives
5) Study the influence of mis/disinformation on bias

Main Contributions:
- New concepts of relative and contextual bias
- A theory relating 8 hypotheses about bias in LLMs  
- Classification of 8 bias types (context, language, connotation, position, data, algorithmic, topic, intention)
- Innovative techniques leveraging tensor networks, machine translation, social norms, etc. to realize the framework
- Methods and products for defining, quantifying, augmenting, mitigating, and explaining bias in LLMs as well as analyzing the role of mis/disinformation

The main goal is to "embrace bias to mitigate bias" by modeling a spectrum of perspectives to enable LLMs to reach more objective conclusions about sensitive issues.
