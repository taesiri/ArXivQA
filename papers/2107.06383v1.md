# [How Much Can CLIP Benefit Vision-and-Language Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06383v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How much can pretrained CLIP models benefit vision-and-language tasks?

Specifically, the paper investigates whether simply fine-tuning the image encoder and text encoder of CLIP jointly on downstream vision-and-language tasks can outperform state-of-the-art approaches that were specifically designed for those tasks. The key hypothesis is that the rich multimodal representations learned by CLIP during pretraining on a large dataset of image-text pairs can generalize well to various vision-and-language tasks with just simple fine-tuning. The paper analyzes the performance of fine-tuned CLIP models across a diverse set of V&L tasks to quantify the benefits.

In summary, the core research question is about quantifying the transfer learning abilities of CLIP for V&L tasks through comprehensive experiments, with the hypothesis that CLIP can achieve new state-of-the-art results by simply fine-tuning the model, without any task-specific architectural modifications or priors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing CLIP-ViL, a simple framework that leverages CLIP to provide visual features for existing vision-and-language models.

- Showing that CLIP visual features can substantially improve performance across a wide range of V&L tasks, including VQA, captioning, retrieval, grounding, etc. 

- Demonstrating CLIP-ViL outperforms sophisticated prior work like VL-BERT and UNITER, often by a large margin, illustrating the surprising effectiveness of the simple CLIP integration.

- Providing an extensive empirical study analyzing the factors behind CLIP-ViL's strong performance, like CLIP's scale and pre-training, Vision Transformer architectures, etc.

- Releasing code and models to facilitate further research into transferring powerful visio-linguistic representations from CLIP to other V&L tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is showing how simply integrating CLIP visual features into existing V&L models leads to substantial gains across diverse tasks, outperforming prior sophisticated models, and providing insights into why CLIP transfers so effectively. The simple yet strong CLIP-ViL framework can serve as a strong baseline for future V&L research.
