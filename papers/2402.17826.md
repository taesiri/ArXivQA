# [Prediction-Powered Ranking of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17826)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ranking large language models (LLMs) by their alignment with human preferences is important but gathering sufficient human pairwise comparisons is costly. 
- Using pairwise comparisons from a strong LLM instead leads to uncertainty about the validity of the resulting ranking due to potential mismatches with human preferences.
- There is currently no way to quantify the uncertainty in LLM rankings constructed using model pairwise comparisons.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a statistical framework to construct a ranking of LLMs along with "rank-sets" that quantify the uncertainty.  
- Rank-sets are sets of possible ranking positions for each LLM. Wider rank-sets indicate higher uncertainty.
- The framework leverages a small set of human pairwise comparisons and a large set of model pairwise comparisons.
- It uses prediction-powered inference to construct a confidence ellipsoid that contains the true probability of each LLM being preferred. 
- The ellipsoid is used to calculate distances to hyperplanes where LLM preference probabilities are equal, which determines the rank-sets.

Main Contributions:
- First statistical framework to quantify uncertainty in LLM rankings using model pairwise comparisons. 
- Rank-sets provide a measure of ranking uncertainty for each LLM.
- Rank-sets are guaranteed, with high probability, to cover the true ranking consistent with human preferences.
- Computationally efficient approach that does not make assumptions about the distribution of human preferences.
- Could help guide data collection and determine when model preferences may not reflect human preferences.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to construct LLM rankings with formal uncertainty quantification in order to account for potential human-model mismatches. The rank-sets and coverage guarantees are the main innovations that make this work impactful.
