# [Group Personalized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01863)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve personalized federated learning performance when there exist inherent groups or clusters among clients that are significantly distinct. The key hypothesis is that for applications where clients can be partitioned into different groups, leveraging the extra knowledge learned from training data of other clients in their group can enhance the personalized model for each individual client.Specifically, the paper proposes a "global FL training + group FL fine-tuning + local personalization" approach and hypothesizes it can achieve superior personalization performance compared to other FL methods. The experiments on two real-world datasets for language modeling aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing group personalized federated learning (FL), which is a three-step method that combines global FL training, group FL fine-tuning, and local personalization. This allows integrating global aggregation, group-level knowledge sharing, and local training.2. Interpreting the proposed group personalized FL procedure from a Bayesian hierarchical modeling perspective. It shows how higher levels of knowledge sharing (global vs group vs local) reduce uncertainty on the model parameters. 3. Evaluating the proposed method on real-world datasets for language modeling tasks. The experiments on video transcript and Wikipedia text datasets demonstrate that group personalized FL achieves improved personalization performance compared to other FL methods.In summary, the key novelty of this paper is the introduction and empirical evaluation of a group personalized FL approach, which leverages group-level information to enhance personalized FL models when inherent clusters/partitions exist among clients.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a three-step federated learning approach for personalization: 1) global federated learning, 2) group federated fine-tuning to share knowledge within groups of similar clients, and 3) local personalization on each client's data. The key idea is to leverage group information to enhance personalized federated learning when clients have limited local data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on group personalized federated learning (FL) compares to other research in federated learning and personalization:- It proposes a novel 3-step approach of "global FL training + group FL fine-tuning + local personalization". This integrates global aggregation, group-level knowledge sharing, and local training. Other work has explored global and local training, but combining group-level training is novel.- It provides a Bayesian interpretation of how group knowledge sharing reduces uncertainty compared to just local or global sharing. This gives theoretical justification for the approach.- It empirically evaluates the method on language modeling using two real-world datasets - video transcripts and Wikipedia. Showing improved perplexity and word error rate over baselines.- For personalization, it compares against common approaches like fine-tuning a global model locally. But it shows benefits of additional group-level fine-tuning before the local step.- It assumes group information is given rather than developing a clustering method. So it differs from some related work on clustering clients in federated learning.- The techniques are evaluated on natural language processing tasks. This is different from some other FL personalization work that looks at computer vision or recommender systems.Overall, the novel multi-level training procedure and Bayesian interpretation differentiate this paper from prior art. The empirical evaluations on language modeling datasets demonstrate practical benefits over standard personalized FL approaches.
