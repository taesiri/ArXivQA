# [Group Personalized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01863)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve personalized federated learning performance when there exist inherent groups or clusters among clients that are significantly distinct. The key hypothesis is that for applications where clients can be partitioned into different groups, leveraging the extra knowledge learned from training data of other clients in their group can enhance the personalized model for each individual client.Specifically, the paper proposes a "global FL training + group FL fine-tuning + local personalization" approach and hypothesizes it can achieve superior personalization performance compared to other FL methods. The experiments on two real-world datasets for language modeling aim to validate this hypothesis.
