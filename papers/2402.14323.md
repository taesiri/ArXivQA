# [REPOFUSE: Repository-Level Code Completion with Fused Dual Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14323)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of improving repository-level code completion using contextual information from across the codebase. This amplified context can improve prediction accuracy but also increases inference latency, posing a trade-off termed the "Context-Latency Conundrum". The goal is to enhance code completion without sacrificing efficiency.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel approach called "RepoFuse" that fuses two types of cross-file context - "analogy context" based on code similarities, and "rationale context" capturing semantic relationships. It uses a "rank truncated generation (RTG)" technique to selectively condense these contexts into concise prompts to fit within length constraints. This allows incorporating vital context while maintaining efficiency.

Key Contributions:
1) A pioneering technique to fuse analogy and rationale cross-file contexts to guide code completion, significantly improving accuracy.
2) The RTG strategy for prompt construction that retains only the most relevant context within token limits, enhancing throughput by 24.4% and reducing latency by 26.8%.
3) Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, with 40.9-59.75% higher accuracy using only 75.4% of the context length.
4) Effective integration into a large enterprise's workflows, actively assisting developers.

In summary, the paper makes important advances in repository-level code completion by proposing an efficient way to leverage cross-file context through fused dual contexts and truncated prompt generation. This simultaneously improves prediction quality and inference speed. The gains are validated experimentally and through real-world deployment.
