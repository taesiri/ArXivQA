# [Re-parameterized Low-rank Prompt: Generalize a Vision-Language Model   within 0.5K Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10813)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Adapting large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to downstream tasks via fine-tuning can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the original knowledge. 
- Existing prompt tuning methods for adapting CLIP are effective but suffer from inefficiency due to large number of parameters and complex update rules.

Proposed Solution:
- Observe that the generalization ability of CLIP during tuning aligns with the low-rank property of the prompt matrix.
- Propose Re-parameterized Low-Rank Prompts (RLP) which uses a low-rank decomposition to reduce number of parameters.
- Further propose novel initialization to leverage full-rank templates and integrate dropout as lightweight regularization.

Main Contributions:
- First work to show CLIP can be effectively adapted using only 0.5K parameters, much lower than prior arts.
- Show RLP improves average accuracy over 11 datasets by 5.25% over classic prompt tuning.
- Achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods on base-to-new generalization, domain generalization, cross-dataset transfer and few-shot learning.
- RLP brings simplicity, efficiency in training and storage, robustness to hyperparameters, and easy integration into existing methods.

In summary, the paper proposes an extremely lightweight yet effective method called RLP to adapt vision-language models using only 0.5K extra parameters. RLP competes with or outperforms complex state-of-the-art methods across various settings while enjoying advantages like simplicity, efficiency and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Re-parameterized Low-rank Prompts (RLP), a highly efficient and effective method to adapt vision-language models to downstream tasks by re-parameterizing the classic prompts into low-rank prompts with only 0.5K extra parameters while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes Re-parameterized Low-rank Prompts (RLP) to reach effective and efficient adaptation for vision-language models. RLP uses a low-rank decomposition to reduce the number of tunable parameters in classic prompts.

2) It proposes a novel initialization method to allow RLP to leverage good initializations from full-rank prompts.

3) It integrates Dropout as a lightweight regularization module into RLP to further improve performance without introducing extra parameters or inference cost. 

4) It shows RLP can achieve comparable or better performance to state-of-the-art methods on various tasks while using extremely few parameters (only 0.5K). This demonstrates the excellent effectiveness and efficiency of RLP for adapting vision-language models.

In summary, the key innovation is the proposed RLP method, which can effectively adapt vision-language models with high performance but very low parameter cost. The experiments verify its effectiveness and efficiency.
