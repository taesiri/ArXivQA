# [Joint Unsupervised Learning of Deep Representations and Image Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03628)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we jointly learn deep image representations and cluster assignments in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled image data?The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a recurrent framework that combines agglomerative clustering with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) into a single end-to-end model. - Formulating agglomerative clustering as a recurrent process with successive merge operations expressed as steps in time. The CNN learns representations supervised by the clustering results.- Deriving a unified weighted triplet loss function that guides both the agglomerative clustering and representation learning.- Showing that alternating between clustering and representation learning improves both - better representations enable more precise clustering, and cluster assignments provide supervision for representation learning.- Demonstrating superior performance on image clustering across datasets compared to prior methods. The learned representations also transfer well to other tasks like image classification.So in summary, this paper jointly addresses unsupervised representation learning and image clustering in a unified framework with a single loss function, and shows both tasks can benefit each other when addressed together.
