# [Probabilistic Bayesian optimal experimental design using conditional   normalizing flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18337)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Bayesian optimal experimental design aims to conduct experiments that maximally update prior knowledge to posterior knowledge given budget constraints. However, evaluating candidate designs is computationally expensive due to double integration over parameters and data. Problems are also high-dimensional and combinatorial leading to non-robust designs.

Proposed Solution:
- Simultaneously train a conditional normalizing flow (CNF) to efficiently approximate the expected information gain (EIG) while also optimizing a probabilistic formulation of the binary experimental design.

Key Contributions:
- Show the connection between maximizing EIG and maximizing the posterior log-likelihood that CNFs are trained to optimize. This enables joint optimization of the CNF and design.
- Parameterize binary mask design as a Bernoulli distribution which allows gradient-based optimization and post-hoc adjustment of sampling budget without retraining.
- Demonstrate approach on a practical MRI acquisition problem with high-dimensional (320x320) parameters and observations (640x386). Previous works use simplified problems.
- Compare to a Bayesian baseline using the same CNF model but with a hand-crafted design. Show statistically significant gains in reducing uncertainty and error of reconstructions.

In summary, the key novelty is a joint CNF training and probabilistic experimental design approach that makes Bayesian optimal design efficient, scalable and robust enough to tackle large-scale, practical problems in medical imaging. The method is shown to improve uncertainty quantification and image reconstruction over reasonable baselines.
