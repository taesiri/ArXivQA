# [SUMMIT: Source-Free Adaptation of Uni-Modal Models to Multi-Modal   Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11880)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:How can we adapt a set of models trained independently on uni-modal data to a target domain consisting of unlabeled, paired, multi-modal data, without access to the original source dataset? The key aspects are:1) Adapting models trained on uni-modal data (e.g. only images or only point clouds) 2) To a target domain with multi-modal data (e.g. paired images and point clouds)3) Without access to the original source data used to train the modelsThe authors propose a method called SUMMIT to address this problem. The key ideas are using pseudo-label fusion across modalities and automatically choosing between complementary fusion methods based on estimated domain gap. Experiments demonstrate that their approach can improve performance over uni-modal and multi-modal baselines.In summary, the paper tackles the challenging problem of adapting uni-modal models to multi-modal targets in a source-free setting, proposing a solution based on pseudo-label fusion and automatic selection between fusion methods. The central hypothesis is that their approach can effectively perform adaptation in this scenario.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Addressing the problem of adapting models trained on uni-modal data to a target domain with unlabeled, paired, multi-modal data, without access to the original source data. This is a setting of practical importance for reasons explained in the introduction.2. Proposing a new cross-modal, source-free domain adaptation framework that fuses pseudo-labels across modalities using information-theoretic and hypothesis testing approaches. This allows learning cross-modal correlations on the target data and improves adaptation performance.3. Introducing a switching method to automatically choose between two complementary pseudo-label fusion techniques - agreement filtering and entropy weighting - based on estimating the domain gap. 4. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that the proposed method provides significant improvements of up to 12% in mIoU over competing baselines on seven challenging adaptation scenarios.In summary, the main contribution appears to be a new approach for source-free, cross-modal domain adaptation that can learn correlations across modalities without paired training data or source access, using pseudo-label fusion and automatic switching between fusion techniques. The method is shown to outperform existing baselines on multi-modal semantic segmentation tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper: The paper proposes a method to adapt uni-modal models trained separately on different modalities (like images and point clouds) to work together on a new unlabeled target dataset consisting of paired multi-modal data, without requiring access to the original source data used to train the models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on the provided information, I cannot provide a detailed comparison of this paper to other research in the same field, since the full paper text is not included. However, some high-level observations:- The paper appears to address the problem of adapting models trained on uni-modal data to a new multi-modal target dataset, without access to the original training data. This is an important practical problem, as models often need to be adapted to new datasets/domains where the original training data cannot be shared.- The key ideas seem to involve fusing predictions from uni-modal models into pseudo-labels on the new multi-modal dataset, and automatically choosing between different fusion approaches based on estimated domain gap. Using pseudo-labels for unsupervised domain adaptation is a common technique, but the multi-modal and automatic fusion selection aspects appear novel.- Compared to other multi-modal domain adaptation works like xMUDA, a key difference seems to be the relaxation of assumptions about having paired multi-modal source data and access to the source data. This makes the problem more challenging but also more realistic in many cases.- The proposed SUMMIT framework shows strong quantitative results, achieving comparable or superior performance to methods that have access to paired source data. This highlights the promise of the techniques.- In terms of limitations, the approach seems focused specifically on semantic segmentation and two modalities (2D images and 3D point clouds). Extending and evaluating it on other tasks and modalities would be interesting future work.Overall, the paper appears to make useful contributions to an important and challenging domain adaptation scenario, demonstrating the ability to effectively adapt uni-modal models to multi-modal targets in a source-free setting. More detailed related work analysis would require the full paper context.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing methods to learn cross-modal correlations when the source datasets consist of completely unpaired data (e.g. data collected independently for each modality). The authors acknowledge their method still assumes some implicit pairing from splitting the same dataset.- Extending the framework to deal with more than 2 modalities. The current method considers adaptation between 2 modalities but could be expanded.- Applying the approach to additional tasks beyond semantic segmentation such as object detection, depth estimation, etc. The authors demonstrate it on semantic segmentation but it could potentially work for other vision tasks.- Validating the approach on more complex real-world adaptation scenarios with greater domain shifts. The experiments used datasets with controlled shifts - testing on autonomous vehicle datasets captured across very different environments could reveal further challenges.- Incorporating temporal information rather than just single frames. Video data could provide useful cues for adaptation that the current method does not leverage.- Developing a multi-source version of the approach that can adapt an arbitrary number of uni-modal source models together.- Combining ideas from source-free domain adaptation in other areas like self-supervision and curriculum learning to further improve robustness.So in summary, the authors point out several interesting directions to extend the method to more complex scenarios, different tasks, leveraging more modalities and data, and combining it with related domain adaptation ideas. The core concept of adapting uni-modal models together in a source-free way seems promising to explore further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach for adapting uni-modal models trained independently on single modalities to unlabeled multi-modal target data without access to the original source datasets. The key idea is to fuse pseudo-labels predicted by the uni-modal models on the target data to create more robust supervision for adapting to the new domain. A switching framework automatically chooses between two complementary pseudo-label fusion techniques - agreement filtering or entropy weighting - based on the estimated domain gap. Additional cross-modal losses allow learning correlations across modalities on the target data. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over uni-modal and multi-modal baselines on semantic segmentation across challenging adaptation scenarios. The approach provides comparable performance to methods assuming access to source data and paired multi-modal training. This has important practical implications since it relaxes key assumptions made by prior cross-modal domain adaptation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach for unsupervised domain adaptation of semantic segmentation models in a multi-modal setting. The key assumptions relaxed are: (1) the source models are trained independently on uni-modal data instead of jointly on paired multi-modal data, and (2) the source data is not accessible during adaptation on the target domain. To address this challenging setting, the authors propose a framework that fuses pseudo-labels predicted independently by the uni-modal source models on the unlabeled target data. Two complementary fusion techniques are introduced - agreement filtering and entropy weighting - along with a data-driven method to automatically switch between them based on the estimated domain gap. Agreement filtering keeps only confident predictions that agree across modalities, while entropy weighting combines predictions via uncertainty-weighted averages. A hypothesis testing procedure further refines the fused pseudo-labels. These are used to supervise the adaptation process, along with an additional loss term that enforces cross-modal consistency.Experiments are performed on adapting models trained on nuScenes and A2D2 (source) to SemanticKITTI (target) using RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. Results across 7 challenging adaptation scenarios show consistent improvements over uni-modal and multi-modal baselines, achieving gains of up to 12% mIoU. The efficacy of the automatic fusion strategy switching is demonstrated. Additional ablation studies analyze the contribution of each component. Qualitative results showcase the method's ability to correct errors made by the uni-modal source models. The proposed framework provides a practical solution for adapting readily available uni-modal models to new target domains with multi-modal unlabeled data, without needing the original training data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a framework called SUMMIT for adapting uni-modal models trained independently on distinct modalities (2D images and 3D point clouds) to a multi-modal target domain without access to the original source data. The key idea is to fuse the pseudo-labels predicted independently by the uni-modal models on the target data to create more robust pseudo-labels for adaptation. A switching mechanism chooses between two complementary pseudo-label fusion techniques - agreement filtering and entropy weighting - based on estimating the domain gap between source and target. Agreement filtering keeps only predictions that agree across modalities, while entropy weighting does a probabilistic fusion using uncertainty weights. The refined pseudo-labels supervise joint adaptation of the models on the target data. A cross-modal consistency loss allows transfer of information between modalities. Experiments on semantic segmentation tasks show consistent improvements over baselines, highlighting the ability to learn cross-modal correlations without paired source data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is how to adapt a set of models trained independently on uni-modal data to a target domain consisting of unlabeled, paired multi-modal data, without access to the original source training datasets. The paper points out two main limitations of prior work:1) Current cross-modal domain adaptation methods like xMUDA assume the availability of paired multi-modal data in the source domain for joint training of models. They also assume access to this source data during adaptation. Obtaining large paired multi-modal datasets can be very costly and time-consuming. Not having access to source data during adaptation is also problematic for privacy, security, storage, and cost reasons.2) Existing source-free domain adaptation methods operate in a uni-modal setting and do not exploit relationships between modalities.To address these limitations, the paper proposes a framework called SUMMIT that can adapt uni-modal models to a multi-modal target in a source-free setting. The key ideas are:- Fusing pseudo-labels across modalities to create more robust target labels for adaptation. This is done via either agreement filtering or entropy weighting based on estimated domain gap.- Using these refined pseudo-labels to learn cross-modal correlations on the target data. - Automatically switching between complementary pseudo-label fusion approaches based on metadata of models.So in summary, the paper is tackling the new problem of source-free adaptation of independently trained uni-modal models to unlabeled paired multi-modal target data, addressing key limitations of prior cross-modal and source-free domain adaptation techniques.
