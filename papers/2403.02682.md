# [Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02682)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating realistic time series data conditioned on rich metadata is useful for many applications like data augmentation, testing systems, and asking what-if questions. However, existing time series generation methods either ignore metadata or cannot handle the diverse types of metadata available like categorical, continuous, and time-variant variables. Naively extending image and audio generation models also faces challenges due to lack of large-scale pre-trained models for time series and inability to visually evaluate the quality of generated time series.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes TimeWeaver, a novel conditional generative model for time series based on diffusion models. It introduces specialized processing blocks to handle heterogeneous metadata comprising categorical, continuous and time-variant features. This metadata is embedded and provided at each step of the diffusion process to guide the generation of metadata-specific time series. The model builds upon state-of-the-art diffusion backbones CSDI and SSSD specialized for time series.

The paper also proposes the Joint Frechet Time Series Distance (J-FTSD) metric to evaluate conditional time series models. It captures specificity of generation by building joint embeddings of time series and metadata using contrastive learning, allowing calculation of distance between real and synthetic joint distributions.

Main Contributions:
- TimeWeaver model to incorporate rich, heterogeneous metadata for conditional time series generation using diffusion models 
- Specialized metadata preprocessing with self-attention to handle diversity of metadata
- J-FTSD metric using contrastive learning to evaluate conditional generation quality and specificity

Experiments on real-world energy, medical, traffic and pollution datasets show TimeWeaver generates high-quality, metadata-specific samples. It improves downstream classification accuracy by 27% over GAN models, demonstrated by the proposed J-FTSD metric as well as standard "train on synthetic, test on real" evaluations.
