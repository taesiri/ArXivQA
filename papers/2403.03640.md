# [Apollo: Lightweight Multilingual Medical LLMs towards Democratizing   Medical AI to 6B People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Despite vast medical knowledge being in English, local languages are crucial for delivering tailored healthcare, especially in areas with limited resources. 
- Extending reach of medical AI advancements to broader populations requires developing medical AI across multiple languages.

Proposed Solution:
- Created ApolloCorpora multilingual medical dataset covering English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Arabic and Hindi.
- Developed Apollo series of multilingual medical LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters, outperforming models of equivalent size. 
- Introduced lightweight model-agnostic ProxyTuning method to improve larger general LLMs' multilingual medical capabilities without directly exposing them to sensitive medical data.

Main Contributions:
- High-quality multilingual ApolloCorpora medical dataset and XMedBench benchmark
- State-of-the-art Apollo multilingual medical LLMs, especially in relatively small sizes 
- Innovative ProxyTuning approach that enhances larger models' capabilities without fine-tuning, mitigating privacy risks
- Overall furthering access to medical AI for 6 billion people across 132 countries by supporting six most widely spoken languages

The paper makes notable contributions in compiling multilingual resources, developing specialized models, and introducing methods to safely improve larger models, helping democratize access to medical AI globally, especially in underserved communities.
