# [ComplexityNet: Increasing LLM Inference Efficiency by Learning Task   Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11511)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have significantly advanced AI capabilities but also have very high computational costs that scale with model size. This makes them inaccessible and inefficient, especially for simpler tasks that don't require the most advanced model.

- There lacks a systematic approach to automatically select the optimal LLM for a given task based on its complexity. Current platforms rely on manual selection, leading to inefficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ComplexityNet, a small LLM fine-tuned to predict the complexity of a task prompt. Complexity is defined as the simplest LLM that can successfully accomplish the task.

- They assign complexity labels to prompts in a Python coding dataset based on success rates of Code Llama 7B, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on solving them. A mapping then assigns these labels to one of the three models.

- They fine-tune DaVinci-002 multiple times on this labeled dataset to create ComplexityNet models that take a prompt and output a complexity score.

Main Contributions:
- Created first complexity labels for Python coding tasks based on LLM success rates

- Fine-tuned ComplexityNet achieves 79% accuracy on complexity inference, significantly higher than 34% for base model

- Enables over 90% cost reduction in inferences while maintaining 86.7% accuracy by using appropriate LLM selected by ComplexityNet

- Demonstrates finetuning smaller models to categorize task complexity is a promising direction to balance accuracy and efficiency for LLM applications

In summary, the paper presents ComplexityNet that can accurately assess task complexity for efficient LLM usage, helping address growing computational demands. The framework is generalizable to other datasets and tasks as well.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents ComplexityNet, a model for assessing the complexity of tasks to efficiently allocate them across language models with different capabilities, demonstrating a 90% reduction in compute costs while maintaining 86.7% accuracy on Python coding tasks from the MBPP dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the development of ComplexityNet, a streamlined language model designed to assess the complexity of tasks and accordingly determine the most appropriate large language model to use for a given task. Specifically:

- The authors fine-tuned a small language model (Davinci-002) on a dataset of programming prompts labeled with complexity levels. This resulting "ComplexityNet" model can take a new prompt as input and predict its complexity level.

- They demonstrated ComplexityNet's ability to effectively categorize prompts based on complexity, achieving 79% accuracy on a test set, a significant improvement over the original unmodified model's 34% accuracy. 

- By assigning prompts to different large language models (Code Llama 7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) based on ComplexityNet's complexity assessments, the authors showed dramatic computational savings - estimating a 90% cost reduction compared to always using the most capable (and expensive) GPT-4 model, while still maintaining 86.7% accuracy on code generation from the prompts.

In summary, the main contribution is using complexity prediction to optimize large language model usage for improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs. The authors suggest this approach of learning task complexity shows promise for making large language models more efficient and accessible.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Inference costs
- Computational resource usage 
- Task complexity
- Model selection
- Fine-tuning
- Prompt complexity
- Complexity model
- Cost savings
- Accuracy trade-offs
- Code generation
- Python coding tasks
- MBPP dataset

The paper presents a method called "ComplexityNet" which is a streamlined language model designed to assess the complexity of tasks and select the most appropriate LLM to solve that task based on its complexity. Key aspects include fine-tuning a small LLM (Davinci-002) to categorize task complexity, analyzing complexity on Python coding tasks from the MBPP dataset, and demonstrating significant cost savings in inference while maintaining high accuracy through selective model usage based on predicted complexity. So terms related to those methodological components and the overall goal of balancing accuracy and efficiency in LLM usage are central in this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using 3 primary models (Code Llama, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) to determine the complexity of prompts. What are some potential issues with only using 3 models to categorize complexity? Could adding more models with different capabilities improve complexity determination?

2. The mapping scheme to determine complexity levels seems somewhat arbitrary based on the empirical success rates of the models. Is there a more principled way this mapping can be derived? Or is the empirical mapping reasonable?

3. The paper determines complexity based on whether the models can solve coding tasks. How might the notion of complexity differ for other types of tasks like text generation? Would the method still be effective?

4. When testing the models, only 5 trials are done per prompt. Is this number of trials sufficient to reliably determine capability on that prompt? Could increasing the number of trials improve results?

5. The complexity model (fine-tuned Davinci) achieves only 70-79% accuracy. What are some ways this accuracy could potentially be improved with changes to the methodology?

6. The complexity model improved significantly with 5-trial labeling compared to single trial labeling. Why does this multi-trial approach improve performance so much? 

7. The dataset was "cleaned" by removing datapoints where all 3 models failed. What effect could this cleaning process have on the complexity distribution in the dataset? Does it skew the data at all?

8. The method relied on the Mostly Basic Python Problems dataset. How might performance differ on other code generation datasets? Could the method work well for general purpose datasets too?

9. The cost savings analysis makes several assumptions about model costs and dataset complexity distribution. How valid are these assumptions and to what extent could deviations affect the estimated cost savings?

10. The method is currently focused only on code generation. How could the ideas translate to other applications of large language models like text generation, QA systems, search engines etc? Would only model selection help or is a modified approach needed?
