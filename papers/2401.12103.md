# [LearnedWMP: Workload Memory Prediction Using Distribution of Query   Templates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12103)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately estimating the working memory requirements of database query workloads is critical for admission control, workload management, and capacity planning in DBMSs. 
- Existing approaches estimate resource usage of individual queries separately, missing optimizations from modeling query interactions in a workload and batch processing.
- There is currently no practical approach to accurately predict memory needs for a batch of concurrent queries (a workload).

Proposed Solution - LearnedWMP:
- Represents a workload's distribution of queries to "query templates", which group similar queries by plan structure.  
- Learns a workload memory predictor from these representations using neural networks.
- Processes queries in batches during both training and inference for greater efficiency.

Key Contributions:
- First workload-based memory predictor for databases, transforming the task into a distribution regression problem.
- Significantly reduces estimation error (by up to 47.6%) compared to current practice.
- Model and variants are 3-10x faster in training and inference than single-query alternatives.
- Demonstrates feasibility and potential of the approach through comprehensive experiments over 3 standard benchmarks.

In summary, the paper introduces the novel concept of workload memory prediction for databases using distribution regression. The proposed LearnedWMP model achieves much higher accuracy than existing methods while also being faster and smaller. Experiments over standard benchmarks demonstrate the merit and promise of the technique for integration into commercial DBMS query optimizers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LearnedWMP, a novel machine learning approach for predicting the working memory demand of a batch of database queries (a workload) by modeling the prediction problem as a distribution regression task that maps the distribution of queries in the workload over learned query templates to an estimated memory usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LearnedWMP, a novel machine learning based approach for predicting the working memory demand of a batch of database queries (i.e. a workload). Key aspects of this contribution include:

1) Formulating the workload memory prediction problem as a distribution regression task, where a model learns to map a distribution of queries in a workload (encoded as a histogram) to the aggregate memory demand of the workload. This is a departure from prior works that focus on predicting memory for individual queries.

2) Devising methods to learn query templates in an unsupervised manner by grouping similar queries based on their query plan characteristics. This allows compressing the queries in a workload into a compact histogram representation that serves as input to the prediction model.

3) Proposing a deep neural network architecture as the prediction model, and comparing it with other ML techniques like random forests and XGBoost. The model is trained on historical workloads labeled with their actual memory usage.

4) Demonstrating up to 47.6% reduction in memory estimation errors compared to commercial database systems, while also being faster and smaller in size than alternative single-query based ML models.

In summary, the key innovation is formulating workload-level memory prediction as a distribution regression problem and showing the feasibility of this approach through comprehensive experiments. The model has the potential to enhance workload management and improve query performance in database systems.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Workload memory prediction

- Workload histograms
- LearnedWMP model
- Deep learning
- RMSE
- Query optimization
- Resource estimation
- Database benchmarks (TPC-DS, JOB, TPC-C)

The paper introduces the problem of workload memory prediction, which involves estimating the memory demand for a batch of queries (a workload) rather than individual queries. It formulates this as a distribution regression problem, where a model learns to map a workload represented as a distribution (histogram) of query templates to a memory usage value. The key components of their proposed LearnedWMP model include learning query templates using clustering, constructing histograms from workloads, and training a deep neural network regressor. Evaluation is performed on database benchmarks like TPC-DS, JOB and TPC-C, using accuracy metrics such as RMSE. The key terms reflect the novel problem being addressed, the proposed solution approach and the experimental methodology followed.
