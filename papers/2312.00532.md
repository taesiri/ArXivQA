# [DeepDR: Deep Structure-Aware RGB-D Inpainting for Diminished Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00532)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes DeepDR, the first deep learning framework for simultaneous RGB-D inpainting to enable diminished reality (DR) applications. DR refers to virtually removing real objects from a scene and plausibly replacing them with estimated background textures and geometry. Compared to previous works, DeepDR is uniquely designed to produce coherent color and depth outputs, run in real-time, minimize temporal artifacts between frames, and adhere to structural boundaries in the scene. The method uses a dual-stream encoder to extract features from the RGB and depth inputs separately before fusing them. The decoder features a novel RGB-D SPADE module that conditions the image and depth generation on an intermediate semantic segmentation prediction to ensure sharp and consistent boundaries. Further, a convolutional LSTM unit and training process with synthesized temporal data allow DeepDR to significantly reduce flickering artifacts. Experiments demonstrate that DeepDR outperforms previous sequential pipelines for RGB-D inpainting qualitatively and quantitatively on synthetic and real indoor and outdoor datasets. User studies confirm improved perceived realism for diminished reality applications. The ability to plausibly estimate color and geometry behind removed objects paves the way for practical mixed reality experiences.
