# [RepoHyper: Better Context Retrieval Is All You Need for Repository-Level   Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06095)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing code completion tools like GitHub Copilot often fail to fully utilize the extensive context available in code repositories, constrained by token limits. 
- They overlook intricate dependencies between files, classes, methods etc. which are crucial for program semantics.
- This results in code suggestions not optimally aligned with intended functionality or project architecture.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces RepoHyper, a novel framework for repository-level code completion.
- It features three key components:
  1) Repo-level Semantic Graph (RSG): Graph structure that encapsulates core elements of a repository and their dependencies.
  2) Expand and Refine Retrieval: Includes,
     - Search-then-Expand strategies: Identify semantically similar contexts then expand search to related ones using RSG.
     - Link Predictor: Refines and re-ranks contexts for greater relevance. 
  3) Leverages large language models for final code prediction.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposes RSG, a graph representation capturing global repository context including non-similar but relevant snippets. Significantly improves context retrieval accuracy.

- Implements Expand and Refine retrieval using Search-then-Expand and Link Prediction algorithms to retrieve the most relevant contexts from the RSG.

- Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates significant gains over state-of-the-art methods in both context retrieval and end-to-end code completion tasks.

- Through analytical and ablation studies, confirms vital role of each component in RepoHyper framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces RepoHyper, a novel framework for repository-level code completion featuring a repo-level semantic graph, search-then-expand strategies, and a link predictor to improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieved contexts for code suggestion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of RepoHyper, a novel framework with three key modules designed to address the challenges of repository-level code completion: Repo-level Semantic Graph (RSG), Search-then-Expand Strategies, and a Link Predictor.

2. Development of the RSG, a graph representation that captures the global context of a repository and expands to include non-similar but relevant contexts for code completion. This innovation improves the accuracy and relevance of context retrieval. 

3. Implementation of an Expand and Refine retrieval method consisting of Search-then-Expand Strategies and a Link Prediction algorithm within the RSG to optimize retrieval of the most relevant contexts.

4. Extensive evaluation demonstrating RepoHyper's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on repository-level code retrieval and completion tasks. A series of analyses confirming the vital role of each component.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Repo-level code completion - The paper focuses on code completion at the repository level, taking into account the broader context and dependencies within a code repository.

- Repo-level Semantic Graph (RSG) - A novel graph structure proposed in the paper to represent the semantic relationships and dependencies between code elements in a repository. This serves as the knowledge source for context retrieval.

- Expand and Refine - The two-step context retrieval method proposed, consisting of Search-then-Expand strategies using the RSG and a Link Predictor to refine and re-rank candidate contexts. 

- Search-then-Expand Strategies - Techniques to broaden the search space using the RSG to find non-similar but relevant contexts, including Exhausted Search and Pattern Search.

- Link Predictor - Formulates re-ranking of contexts as a link prediction problem on the RSG to retrieve the most relevant snippets.

- RepoBench - The benchmark dataset used for evaluation, consisting of tasks for context retrieval, code completion with given contexts, and end-to-end code completion.

- CodeBLEU, Exact Match - Evaluation metrics used to measure code completion performance.

So in summary, the key things are the repo-level semantic graph, the expand and refine retrieval method, the use of RepoBench for evaluation, and metrics like CodeBLEU and Exact Match.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel graph structure called the Repo-level Semantic Graph (RSG). How is this representation different from previous approaches in capturing the global context of a code repository? What specific components and relations are included in the RSG to achieve this?

2. The paper proposes an "Expand and Refine" retrieval method consisting of Search-then-Expand Strategies and a Link Predictor. Explain in detail how each of these components works and their role in optimizing context retrieval from the RSG. 

3. The Search-then-Expand Strategies introduce two algorithms - Exhausted Search and Pattern Search. Compare and contrast these two algorithms. What are the tradeoffs between exploration thoroughness and computational efficiency?

4. The paper treats the re-ranking of contexts as a link prediction problem on the RSG. Explain how the contexts are scored based on predicted links. Why is this more effective than simply ranking by embedding similarity?

5. One of the biggest challenges in repository-level code completion is balancing noise and relevance in retrieved contexts. How does RepoHyper address this through its various components?

6. The RepoHyper framework relies extensively on the global program semantics encapsulated within the RSG. Provide some examples of how non-similar but semantically related code across files can provide useful contexts.

7. The paper demonstrates significant improvements on the RepoBench benchmark. Analyze some limitations of the benchmark and datasets used. What additional benchmarks could be utilized to further validate generalizability?  

8. What modifications would be required to apply the RepoHyper framework on languages other than Python? Specifically explain how the RSG structure and relations would need to be adapted.

9. The paper points out some current limitations such as reliance on manual selection of path types and lack of learnable RSG navigation. Propose some concrete ways these could be addressed in future work.

10. Comment on the implications of relying on large, compute-intensive LLMs within the RepoHyper pipeline. How can we work towards more sustainable and trustworthy models for code intelligence?
