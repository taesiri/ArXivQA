# [RepoHyper: Better Context Retrieval Is All You Need for Repository-Level   Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06095)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing code completion tools like GitHub Copilot often fail to fully utilize the extensive context available in code repositories, constrained by token limits. 
- They overlook intricate dependencies between files, classes, methods etc. which are crucial for program semantics.
- This results in code suggestions not optimally aligned with intended functionality or project architecture.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces RepoHyper, a novel framework for repository-level code completion.
- It features three key components:
  1) Repo-level Semantic Graph (RSG): Graph structure that encapsulates core elements of a repository and their dependencies.
  2) Expand and Refine Retrieval: Includes,
     - Search-then-Expand strategies: Identify semantically similar contexts then expand search to related ones using RSG.
     - Link Predictor: Refines and re-ranks contexts for greater relevance. 
  3) Leverages large language models for final code prediction.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposes RSG, a graph representation capturing global repository context including non-similar but relevant snippets. Significantly improves context retrieval accuracy.

- Implements Expand and Refine retrieval using Search-then-Expand and Link Prediction algorithms to retrieve the most relevant contexts from the RSG.

- Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates significant gains over state-of-the-art methods in both context retrieval and end-to-end code completion tasks.

- Through analytical and ablation studies, confirms vital role of each component in RepoHyper framework.
