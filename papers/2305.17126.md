# [Large Language Models as Tool Makers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17126)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we enable large language models (LLMs) to create and effectively utilize their own tools for diverse problem-solving tasks?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By having LLMs generate reusable tools (implemented as Python functions) for tasks and applying those tools to solve new instances, we can enhance the problem-solving capabilities and efficiency of LLMs compared to using them alone. 

Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates a closed-loop framework called LATM (LLMs As Tool Makers) with two main stages:

1) Tool making: A powerful yet expensive LLM acts as a "tool maker" to generate generic tools from a few demonstrations of a task.

2) Tool using: A lightweight and cost-effective LLM acts as a "tool user" to apply the pre-generated tools to solve new instances of that task.

The central hypothesis is that this approach will allow lightweight LLMs to solve complex tasks by using tools generated by more capable LLMs, thereby improving performance while reducing computational costs compared to using powerful LLMs alone. The paper aims to validate this hypothesis through experiments on reasoning tasks.

In summary, the key research question is how to enable LLMs to make and use their own tools for efficient and high-quality problem-solving. The central hypothesis is that the proposed LATM framework will achieve this aim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, this paper proposes a closed-loop framework called LLM As Tool Makers (LATM) that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate their own reusable tools for solving tasks. The key ideas are:

- Tool making: A powerful yet expensive LLM acts as a "tool maker" to create generic Python utility functions for given tasks based on a few demonstrations. 

- Tool using: A lightweight and cost-effective LLM serves as a "tool user" to apply the pre-made tools to solve new instances of the task.

- Dispatcher: An additional lightweight LLM determines whether an incoming request can reuse existing tools or if a new tool needs to be made by the "tool maker".

The main benefits are:

- Enhances problem-solving capabilities of LLMs by allowing them to create customized tools.

- Achieves cost-effectiveness by reusing tools and having a separate lightweight "tool user" LLM.

- Adds flexibility to handle streaming data by introducing the "dispatcher" module.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel closed-loop framework LATM to allow LLMs to create and reuse their own tools, enhancing their problem-solving abilities in a cost-effective manner. The separation of tool maker and tool user also allows better optimization.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

The main novelty of this paper is the proposal for a closed-loop framework called LATM (LLMs As Tool Makers) that enables large language models (LLMs) to create their own reusable tools for problem solving. Most prior work on augmenting LLMs has focused on utilizing existing tools, so the idea of having the LLMs generate tools themselves is an innovative concept. 

In terms of using tools to enhance LLMs, this research aligns with previous work like REACT, Chameleon, HuggingFace GPT, and ToolFormer. However, a key difference is that those methods rely on integrating existing tools, whereas LATM allows LLMs to build new tools tailored for the task at hand.

This paper also relates to work on adaptive decoding and model cascades like Fast decoding and FrugalGPT, which aim to balance cost and accuracy in LLMs. LATM shares a similar motivation but proposes a unique approach through tool making and tool using stages with different models.

The technique of programming by example to create tools is connected to prior work on program synthesis from examples like MathQA and Program Synthesis by Example. But this paper applies the concept in a new way for meta-learning of tools by LLMs.

Overall, I would say the core ideas around automated tool synthesis and specialized tool makers/users make LATM distinct from prior work. The results on complex reasoning datasets demonstrate the promise of this new framework to enhance LLMs' problem solving capabilities in a more autonomous and cost-effective manner.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more sophisticated methods for tool creation, such as allowing the tool maker to iteratively refine and upgrade tools over time to handle new types of problems or instances. The authors suggest this could mimic the software development process and allow for more advanced and adaptive tool making.

- Creating higher quality and more realistic datasets to evaluate LLMs in interactive scenarios like scheduling meetings or routing planning. The authors note the lack of such rich and raw natural language datasets currently. 

- Exploring efficient and safe methods to maintain control over autonomous LLMs as they become more capable of independent tool generation. The authors point out the risks if these models are deployed at scale without appropriate regulation.

- Investigating techniques to improve verification of the generated tools, which is challenging in real-world deployments. The authors suggest this is an important issue to study further.

- Applying the framework to a broader range of complex reasoning tasks to continue assessing and improving its capabilities.

- Examining methods to optimize the selection of LLMs in the tool maker and tool user stages to achieve the best tradeoff of accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

In summary, the key directions encompass developing more advanced tool making capabilities, creating better datasets, ensuring safety and control, improving tool verification, expanding applications, and optimizing model selection. Advancing research in these areas could help realize the potential of autonomous tool generation in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a closed-loop framework called LLM as Tool Maker (LATM) that enables large language models (LLMs) to create and reuse their own tools for problem solving. The framework has two key stages - tool making where a powerful yet expensive LLM acts as a tool maker to generate reusable tools (implemented as Python functions) for a task from a few demonstrations, and tool using where a lightweight and cheaper LLM acts as a tool user to apply the pre-made tools to solve new instances. The separation of tool making and tool using allows the framework to achieve comparable performance to using only powerful models, while being more cost-effective. The tool maker only needs to be invoked once per task type to create a reusable tool. Experiments on logical reasoning tasks like those in BigBench validate the efficacy of the proposed framework. An additional lightweight LLM called the dispatcher can enable on-the-fly tool making and usage in a streaming setting with multiple tasks. Overall, the work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to not just use tools but also create their own, paving the way for more capable and scalable LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called LLM As Tool Maker (LATM) that enables large language models (LLMs) to create and reuse their own tools for problem solving. LATM has two key stages - tool making and tool using. In the tool making stage, a powerful yet expensive LLM serves as the "tool maker" to generate reusable tools implemented as Python functions from a few demonstrations of a task. In the tool using stage, a lightweight and cheaper LLM serves as the "tool user" to apply the tools built by the tool maker to solve various instances of that task. The separation of tool making and tool using allows LATM to leverage the capabilities of advanced LLMs for tool creation while significantly reducing computational costs for tool usage. 

The paper validates LATM on a diverse set of complex reasoning tasks and shows it can match the performance of resource-intensive models like GPT-4 while being more cost-effective. Additional experiments demonstrate the tool making requirements, tool using model capacities needed, and the ability to handle streaming data by adding a "dispatcher" LLM. Overall, by mimicking humans' evolutionary leap in tool creation and usage, LATM paves the way for LLMs to achieve enhanced autonomous problem solving. The proposed framework is promising but also raises important considerations around safety, control and ethical impacts that need to be addressed as future work.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a closed-loop framework called LLMs as Tool Makers (LATM) that allows large language models (LLMs) to create and reuse their own tools for problem solving. The method has two key stages - tool making and tool using. In the tool making stage, a powerful yet expensive LLM serves as the "tool maker" to generate reusable Python functions from a few demonstrations of a task. This is done through prompts based on programming by example. The tool maker then wraps up the function code along with demonstrations of how to call the function. In the tool using stage, a lightweight and inexpensive LLM serves as the "tool user" by calling these tool functions to solve various instances of the task. By separating tool making and using into different LLMs, LATM is able to leverage the strengths of both powerful and lightweight models to achieve strong performance while maintaining cost effectiveness. The tool making only needs to be done once per task while the tools can be reused across instances.
