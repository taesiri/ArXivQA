# [Automated Code generation for Information Technology Tasks in YAML   through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02783)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can large language models be applied to generate Ansible YAML code from natural language prompts, and can models customized for Ansible outperform general code generation models?

More specifically, some key aspects the paper investigates are:

- Developing transformer-based models specialized for generating Ansible YAML code from natural language, through pretraining on YAML and Ansible YAML data. 

- Proposing novel performance metrics tailored for evaluating Ansible YAML generation.

- Comparing models pretrained on Ansible/YAML data against existing general code generation models like CodeGen and Codex in few-shot settings.

- Analyzing the effects of various factors like prompt formulation, context window size, model size, and training data size when fine-tuning for the Ansible generation task.

- Demonstrating that their customized Ansible Wisdom models can achieve better performance on Ansible YAML generation compared to Codex and CodeGen, especially when fine-tuned on Ansible data.

So in summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that large language models customized for Ansible through pretraining and fine-tuning will outperform general code generation models on the task of generating Ansible YAML. The paper presents experiments and results to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- The authors explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to generating Ansible YAML code from natural language prompts. Ansible YAML is widely used for IT automation but has received little attention in terms of AI-assisted coding. 

- They build a new dataset containing Ansible YAML code for both pretraining and finetuning tasks. The dataset comes from sources like GitHub, Google BigQuery, GitLab, and Ansible Galaxy.

- They develop transformer-based models called "Ansible Wisdom" for generating Ansible YAML from natural language. These models are pretrained on their YAML dataset and then finetuned for the natural language to Ansible YAML task.

- They propose two new evaluation metrics tailored for assessing Ansible YAML generation: Ansible Aware and Schema Correct. 

- Their experiments show that their Ansible Wisdom models can generate Ansible YAML accurately from natural language prompts, outperforming existing code generation models like Codex and CodeGen in few-shot settings.

- After finetuning, their best model (BLEU of 66.67) can even surpass a much larger Codex model (BLEU of 50.4), which was evaluated in few-shot mode. 

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the feasibility of applying LLMs to generate Ansible YAML code from natural language, including creating Ansible-specific models, metrics and datasets. The results show strong performance on this task, outperforming general code generation models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related research on using large language models for code generation:

- It focuses specifically on generating Ansible YAML code, whereas most prior work has focused on general programming languages like Python, Java, C++, etc. Ansible YAML is an important domain-specific language, but has received relatively little attention so far in code generation research.

- The paper introduces two new metrics tailored to evaluating Ansible YAML generation - Ansible Aware and Schema Correct. Most prior work uses more general metrics like BLEU, exact match accuracy, etc. The new metrics allow for more meaningful evaluation on the nuances of Ansible YAML.

- It explores both pre-training and fine-tuning transformer models on YAML data. Many recent papers have focused just on pre-training or just on fine-tuning. Looking at both allows for insights into the benefits of each approach. 

- Both generic YAML data and Ansible-specific YAML data are used during pre-training. Most prior work uses only data from the target domain during pre-training. Using the additional generic YAML seems to provide a useful boost in performance.

- The paper systematically compares pre-training vs fine-tuning, model sizes, context window sizes, etc. This ablation study provides insights into what factors matter most for generating high-quality Ansible YAML specifically.

- The proposed Ansible Wisdom model outperforms Codex and baseline CodeGen models on Ansible YAML generation after pre-training and fine-tuning. This highlights the benefits of customization for this domain.

Overall, the paper makes excellent progress in adapting code generation techniques to the important but understudied domain of Ansible YAML. The rigorous experiments and new evaluation metrics advance the state-of-the-art in this domain specifically.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Expanding the capabilities of the model to generate more complex Ansible playbooks with multiple plays and tasks. The current model is limited in generating mainly single task playbooks and roles.

- Improving the model's ability to generate secure and safe Ansible code. The authors mention the model currently optimizes for metrics on the test set and is not trained to generate secure code. Adding security and safety considerations into the training data and analysis is needed.

- Conducting more analysis on the model's sensitivity to variations in prompts, including different phrasing, indentation, capitalization etc. Evaluating the model's robustness is important.

- Expanding beyond just natural language to Ansible generation to a more general code completion task. Allowing the model to take in prompts at different points in the code development process.

- Evaluating performance on specialized test sets focused only on playbook or only on task generation. The current test set contains a mix of both.

- Considering more complex decoder strategies like beam search during inference to improve results over greedy decoding.

- Adding an insertion penalty to the evaluation metrics to account for extra generated content.

- Increasing the diversity of playbook samples for training/evaluation, since the current dataset is limited in playbook complexity.

- Testing the model on additional domain specific metrics related to correctness of generated Ansible.

In summary, expanding the model's capabilities to handle more complex Ansible generation tasks, improving robustness, and testing on more diverse and domain-focused datasets seem like the key future directions highlighted.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) to generating Ansible YAML code from natural language descriptions. Ansible YAML is widely used to define infrastructure configuration but requires expertise to write correctly.

Four versions of the model are trained with different amounts of YAML data to measure the impact. Novel evaluation metrics specific to YAML and Ansible are also introduced. Experiments show the benefits of pre-training on YAML before fine-tuning, with their best model achieving higher scores than Codex and baseline CodeGen. The work demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to assist with Ansible YAML generation, which could improve productivity for many users. Limitations are the lack of complex playbook examples in the training data. Overall the paper makes a case for applying LLMs to domain specific languages like YAML.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Ansible Wisdom, a natural language to Ansible-YAML code generation tool aimed at improving IT automation productivity. Ansible Wisdom is a transformer-based model extended by training with a new dataset containing Ansible-YAML. The authors build YAML and Ansible-YAML datasets for pretraining and finetuning tasks in code generation. They reformulate the Ansible-YAML generation problem into a code completion task by utilizing the "name" field in Ansible-YAML as a natural language prompt. Several transformer-based models are pretrained on the datasets and then finetuned for the code generation task. Two novel metrics tailored for YAML and Ansible are proposed to evaluate the models. Results show Ansible Wisdom can accurately generate Ansible scripts from natural language at performance comparable or better than existing state-of-the-art models like Codex. In few-shot settings, the impact of training with Ansible and YAML data is assessed and compared to different baselines including Codex. After finetuning, the Ansible-specific model outperforms Codex, which was evaluated in few-shot mode. Overall, the work demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of applying transformer models to generating domain specific languages like Ansible-YAML.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) building YAML and Ansible datasets for pretraining and finetuning transformer models on code generation tasks 2) reformulating the problem as code completion using Ansible's "name" field 3) proposing Ansible-specific metrics 4) showing competitive results vs baselines like Codex, enabled by pretraining on YAML and finetuning for Ansible. The work highlights the potential for improving productivity in IT automation through LLMs tailored to domain specific languages.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using transformer-based models for generating Ansible YAML code from natural language prompts. They start with an existing pre-trained decoder model called CodeGen and extend its pre-training using two new datasets - one containing only Ansible YAML and another containing both Ansible YAML and generic YAML. After pre-training, the models are fine-tuned on a dataset extracted from Ansible Galaxy containing playbooks and tasks. To take advantage of the "name" field commonly used in Ansible YAML to describe the intent, they reformulate the problem as conditional code completion rather than full code generation. The natural language prompt is used as the "name" and the model must complete the remainder of the code. They experiment with different model sizes, context window sizes, and amounts of fine-tuning data. Their customized pre-training and reformulation of the task provides significant improvements in metrics like exact match, BLEU score, and an Ansible-specific metric they propose compared to using the base CodeGen model.
