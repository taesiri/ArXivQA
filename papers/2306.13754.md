# [Zero-shot spatial layout conditioning for text-to-image diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13754)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models. The key research question is how to enable image generation from text prompts combined with segmentation maps, in order to align the generated content with the spatial layout indicated in the segmentation maps. The central hypothesis is that by extracting implicit segmentation maps from the cross-attention layers of pretrained text-to-image diffusion models, and using them to compute a loss that is minimized with gradient guidance, it is possible to steer the image generation process to respect the spatial conditioning maps. This approach does not require any additional training on top of the pretrained text-to-image model.In summary, the paper introduces a novel "zero-shot segmentation guidance" method called ZestGuide that allows controlling the spatial layout of images generated by diffusion models using segmentation maps, without needing to train on images annotated with segmentations. The key idea is to extract segmentation maps from the model's attention and use them for gradient-based guidance during sampling.
