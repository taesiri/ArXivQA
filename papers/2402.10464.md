# [FedKit: Enabling Cross-Platform Federated Learning for Android and iOS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10464)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing mobile federated learning (FL) systems have limitations in enabling practical cross-platform FL research using real-world data from user smartphones. Key challenges are:
  1) Lack of support for collaborative training and aggregation of models across Android and iOS platforms
  2) Limited flexibility and control over the FL pipeline when deployed in production 
  3) Unfamiliar mobile development hinders data scientists from building models

Proposed Solution - FedKit:
- A system to enable cross-platform FL between Android and iOS devices via a model conversion pipeline and unified training APIs
  - Converts TensorFlow models to TFLite (Android) and CoreML (iOS) format
  - Exposes same training APIs on both platforms 
  - Unifies model parameters for cross-platform aggregation
- Enables flexible machine learning operations (MLOps) when deployed via:
  1) Continuous cross-platform model delivery without app updates
  2) Customizable federated training through parallel servers
- User-friendly Python-based development environment

Main Contributions:
- Cross-platform support for FL between Android and iOS
- Model conversion pipeline to enable collaborative training and aggregation
- Unified training APIs invoking platform accelerators 
- Flexible MLOps for continuous delivery and fast experimentation
- Demonstrated effectiveness in real-world mobile health use case

The proposed FedKit system aims to make cross-device federated learning more accessible to researchers by tackling key limitations in existing approaches. It contributes pipelines for model conversion, tools to customize deployment, and validation in real-world applications.
