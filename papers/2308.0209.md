# [GOALS-JWST: Gas Dynamics and Excitation in NGC7469 revealed by NIRSpec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0209)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:What is the role of the Seyfert nucleus in the excitation and dynamics of the circumnuclear gas in the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 7469? Specifically, the authors investigate the gas excitation and kinematics in the inner kiloparsec region of NGC 7469 using near-infrared emission lines observed with the NIRSpec instrument on JWST. They analyze the emission line ratios of H2, [Fe II], and hydrogen recombination lines to understand the excitation mechanisms (star formation, AGN, shocks). They also study the gas velocity fields and dispersion to examine the dynamics, including signatures of outflows, inflows, and rotational motion. The goal is to elucidate the interplay between the feeding of the AGN, feedback through outflows, and the impact on the surrounding interstellar medium.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Presenting new JWST-NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 7469. These observations provide high spatial resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared, allowing detailed study of the gas dynamics and excitation in the central region. 2. Analyzing emission line ratios to determine the excitation mechanisms of molecular hydrogen, iron, and hydrogen recombination lines. The analysis finds contributions from the AGN, star formation, and shocks to the gas excitation on ~100 pc scales.3. Studying the gas kinematics using velocity field and dispersion maps. The motions are dominated by rotation but also show evidence for non-circular motions indicative of gas inflows. The inflow rate is estimated to be up to two orders of magnitude higher than the AGN accretion rate.4. Estimating the kinetic power of the nuclear outflow based on prior work. Comparison to the power of the compact radio jet suggests it may be capable of driving the outflow. 5. Bringing together the results to propose a self-regulating feeding-feedback loop, where inflows provide fuel for accretion and outflows, with the small-scale radio jet contributing to driving the outflow.In summary, the key contribution is utilizing JWST's capabilities to reveal the interplay between accretion, feedback, and the multi-phase ISM in the inner kiloparsec of an active galaxy. The results provide new insights into the feeding and feedback processes in action.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:Using JWST-NIRSpec, the authors find evidence for AGN photoionization, shock excitation from a compact radio jet, gas inflows, and feedback regulating the inner kiloparsec of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 7469.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on gas dynamics and excitation in active galaxies:- The use of JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy provides unprecedented spatial resolution (down to ~70 pc) in mapping the gas kinematics and excitation in the inner kiloparsec of NGC 7469. Most other studies rely on ground-based observations with more limited spatial resolution. - Analyzing multiple emission lines (\feii, H2, Brγ, Paα) reveals the complex excitation mechanisms at play including contributions from the AGN, star formation, and shocks. Many other studies focus on one particular gas phase. - Evidence is presented for both outflowing and inflowing gas based on the kinematics. Quantifying mass outflow/inflow rates shows they are comparable, indicating a self-regulating feedback loop. Other works often focus on just outflows or inflows.- Power source of outflow is explored by connecting to observed compact radio jet. Many works do not probe what drives observed outflows. - A turbulent broad component to recombination lines is identified, not attributable to regular broad line region. Unique to have spatial mapping to reveal this.- Overall, the multi-phase, multi-species analysis provides a detailed look at the nuclear regions of an active galaxy. State-of-the-art observations enable advances in understanding feeding/feedback processes. Builds on previous work with enhanced resolution and diagnostic power.In summary, this study leverages JWST's capabilities to provide new insights into gas excitation, dynamics, inflows, and outflows in an active galaxy. It represents an advance in methodology and level of detail compared to most other studies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further spatially resolved studies of gas excitation mechanisms in (U)LIRGs using emission line diagnostics. The authors highlight the complexity revealed even in NGC 7469 and suggest more observations are needed for a comprehensive understanding. - Additional studies linking mechanical feedback from AGNs (e.g. radio jets) to driving larger-scale outflows in galaxies. The authors propose the jet is driving the ionized outflow in NGC 7469 but more examples are needed.- Further analysis of inflowing gas and inflow-outflow mass balance in AGN/starburst systems. The dual spiral pattern and modeling suggest significant inflows in NGC 7469 that may relate to feeding/feedback processes.- Expanding the multiwavelength data on NGC 7469 and similar galaxies, to combine IR, radio, and X-ray observations that can probe obscured activity.- Applying resolved kinematic studies to larger samples of (U)LIRGs to identify trends and diversity in their complex gas dynamics.In summary, the key future directions relate to gathering more observational constraints on gas flows, feedback, and the interplay between AGN, starbursts, and galactic gas in IR-luminous galaxies. The new capabilities of JWST will aid this substantially.
