# [How to be fair? A study of label and selection bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are many proposed measures and techniques for bias mitigation in machine learning models. However, it is still poorly understood when different techniques are effective and which techniques should be used under different circumstances of bias. 

- Recently, it has been shown that optimizing for certain fairness measures on biased data can sometimes lead to more accurate models on unbiased data, suggesting the traditional fairness-accuracy tradeoff may not always apply. However, a thorough theoretical analysis of when different bias mitigation techniques are effective is still lacking.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the "Fair World Framework" which assumes an underlying fair data distribution that gets distorted by a bias introduction process to produce the biased dataset that we observe. The choice of bias process and fairness criteria are assumptions to be made.

- The paper theoretically analyzes the effectiveness of bias mitigation techniques aiming to optimize certain fairness criteria, for two different bias introduction processes (label bias and selection bias) and two fairness criteria (statistical parity and "We're All Equal"). 

Key Contributions:

- Formal definitions provided for label bias, selection bias, statistical parity and "We're All Equal" fairness criteria

- For each combination of fairness criteria and bias process, derived properties the biased data must satisfy. Allows checking consistency of assumptions made.

- Showed mathematically whether optimizing for a particular fairness criteria on biased data produced by a particular bias process allows recovering the fair model that would perform well on unbiased data.

- Provided theoretical explanation for recent empirical results showing accuracy gains on fair data from fairness interventions on biased data.

- Demonstrated cases where minimizing fairness measures on biased data does not result in the fairest model, highlighting need to consider bias processes.

The theoretical analysis offers new insights into selecting appropriate bias mitigation techniques and helps explain when certain techniques can be effective.
