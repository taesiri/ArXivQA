# [Prompt-driven Latent Domain Generalization for Medical Image   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03002)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep learning models for medical image analysis often suffer from distribution shifts caused by dataset biases, variations in imaging devices, hospitals, etc. This leads to overreliance on spurious cues rather than learning real diagnostic patterns, resulting in unreliable performance when tested on new datasets. Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to address this by training models on multiple domains to generalize better. However, DG has limitations in medical imaging: 1) Domain labels are expensive to obtain; 2) Definition of domains is ambiguous; 3) Domain splitting depends on the task.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a prompt-driven latent domain generalization (PLDG) framework to address DG for medical image classification without relying on domain labels. The key ideas are:

1) Discover pseudo domain labels by clustering style features from the ViT model based on the simplicity bias property. This captures common medical image biases.

2) Learn domain-specific knowledge using multiple lightweight domain prompts inserted into ViT. A domain prompt generator enables collaboration between prompts to facilitate cross-domain learning.  

3) Employ domain mixup strategy to mitigate incorrect domain assignments from clustering.

Main Contributions:

1) A Simplicity Bias-guided method to discover pseudo domain labels from arbitrary medical datasets without annotations.

2) A novel prompt-based domain generalization algorithm leveraging a domain prompt generator and ViT to promote cross-domain knowledge transfer.

3) Extensive validation across skin cancer, diabetic retinopathy and histopathology image classification showing comparable or better performance over state-of-the-art DG methods without using domain labels.

4) Demonstration that latent domain generalization can be more effective than conventional DG relying on noisy or suboptimal domain labels in medical imaging.

In summary, the key novelty is an unsupervised domain discovery and prompt-based domain generalization framework achieving strong performance without domain labels, making it versatile for real-world medical imaging applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompt-driven framework for domain generalization in medical image classification that discovers pseudo domain labels by clustering style features from a vision transformer and leverages them to train domain prompts that facilitate knowledge sharing across domains for improved generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel prompt-driven latent domain generalization (PLDG) framework for medical image classification. The key highlights are:

1) It introduces a latent domain generalization approach that does not rely on explicit domain labels, which are often unavailable or unreliable in medical datasets. Instead, it discovers pseudo domain labels by clustering style features based on the simplicity bias property.

2) It proposes a prompt learning strategy to capture domain-specific knowledge using multiple lightweight domain prompts. A domain prompt generator is introduced to enable collaboration between prompts for cross-domain knowledge transfer.  

3) Extensive experiments on three medical classification tasks (melanoma, diabetic retinopathy, cancerous tissue detection) and one debiasing task demonstrate that the method achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods without using any domain labels.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a versatile prompt-driven latent domain generalization framework that eliminates the need for explicit domain labels while achieving effective generalization on unseen medical domains. The method addresses key limitations of domain generalization in medical imaging.
