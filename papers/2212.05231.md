# [NeuS2: Fast Learning of Neural Implicit Surfaces for Multi-view   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called NeuS2 for fast and high-quality neural implicit surface reconstruction from multi-view images for both static and dynamic scenes. The central research question is:

How to achieve neural implicit surface reconstruction with the highest possible quality while being as fast as possible?

The key ideas and contributions to address this question are:

1. For static scenes:

- Combine multi-resolution hash encodings with neural SDF to allow using very compact MLPs for fast evaluation and rendering. 

- Derive an efficient computation of second-order derivatives tailored to the MLPs to leverage CUDA parallelism for fast training.

- Introduce a progressive training strategy to stabilize and accelerate training.

2. For dynamic scenes:

- Propose incremental training to exploit temporal similarity between frames.

- Introduce global transformation prediction to handle large motion and prevent getting stuck in local minima.

In summary, the central contribution is a novel formulation and training strategy that allows high-quality implicit neural surface reconstruction from multi-view images at unprecedented speeds for both static and dynamic scenes. This is achieved through a combination of representations, optimizations and training schemes specifically designed for this task.

So in essence, the paper provides a solution to the problem of how to get the best of both worlds - highest quality and maximum efficiency for neural implicit surface reconstruction. The experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods regarding both speed and accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposes a new method called NeuS2 for fast learning of neural surface representations from multi-view RGB input for both static and dynamic scenes. This method achieves significant speedup over prior state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining high reconstruction quality. 

2. Presents a simple formulation of the second-order derivatives tailored to ReLU-based MLPs. This enables efficient parallelization and acceleration of GPU computation during training.

3. Introduces a progressive training strategy to optimize multi-resolution hash encodings from coarse to fine. This helps enforce better and faster training convergence. 

4. Designs an incremental learning method with a novel global transformation prediction component for reconstructing long sequences (e.g. 2000 frames) of dynamic scenes with large movements and deformations in an efficient and stable manner.

5. Demonstrates through experiments on various datasets that NeuS2 significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both surface reconstruction accuracy and training speed for static and dynamic scenes.

In summary, the key innovation is a highly optimized and efficient framework for high-quality neural surface reconstruction from multi-view images/videos, enabled by technical contributions like efficient second-order derivative computations, progressive training, and incremental learning strategies. The method achieves unprecedented reconstruction quality at very fast speeds for both static and dynamic scenes.
