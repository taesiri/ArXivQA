# [NeuS2: Fast Learning of Neural Implicit Surfaces for Multi-view   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called NeuS2 for fast and high-quality neural implicit surface reconstruction from multi-view images for both static and dynamic scenes. The central research question is:

How to achieve neural implicit surface reconstruction with the highest possible quality while being as fast as possible?

The key ideas and contributions to address this question are:

1. For static scenes:

- Combine multi-resolution hash encodings with neural SDF to allow using very compact MLPs for fast evaluation and rendering. 

- Derive an efficient computation of second-order derivatives tailored to the MLPs to leverage CUDA parallelism for fast training.

- Introduce a progressive training strategy to stabilize and accelerate training.

2. For dynamic scenes:

- Propose incremental training to exploit temporal similarity between frames.

- Introduce global transformation prediction to handle large motion and prevent getting stuck in local minima.

In summary, the central contribution is a novel formulation and training strategy that allows high-quality implicit neural surface reconstruction from multi-view images at unprecedented speeds for both static and dynamic scenes. This is achieved through a combination of representations, optimizations and training schemes specifically designed for this task.

So in essence, the paper provides a solution to the problem of how to get the best of both worlds - highest quality and maximum efficiency for neural implicit surface reconstruction. The experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods regarding both speed and accuracy.
