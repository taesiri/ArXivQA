# [Unleashing Vanilla Vision Transformer with Masked Image Modeling for   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02964)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) can be effectively adapted for high-performance object detection by:

1. Feeding the ViT encoder with only randomly sampled partial input embeddings during fine-tuning. This allows processing high-resolution inputs required for object detection with feasible computational costs. 

2. Replacing the pre-trained large kernel patchify stem with a compact randomly initialized convolutional stem. This produces a hierarchical feature pyramid from the single-scale ViT to handle objects at different scales.

The key ideas are to treat the ViT input as 1D token sequences rather than 2D grids, and leverage the ability of MIM pre-trained ViT to reconstruct full representations from partial observations. This helps unlock the potential of vanilla ViT for challenging object-level recognition tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that with the right adaptations, a MIM pre-trained vanilla ViT can achieve strong performance for object detection while overcoming its limitations like quadratic scaling of self-attention and lack of feature hierarchy. The proposed MIMDet method aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents an approach to adapt a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection. The main contributions are:

1. They propose to only feed the ViT encoder with a randomly sampled subset (e.g. 25-50%) of the input patch embeddings during fine-tuning, rather than the full set of embeddings. This reduces the computational cost while still achieving good performance. 

2. They replace the pre-trained patchify stem with a compact randomly initialized convolutional stem. This helps introduce multi-scale features to the single-scale ViT architecture. 

3. The resulting detector, called MIMDet, combines a convolutional stem, sampled ViT encoder, and lightweight ViT decoder. It achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO object detection compared to previous methods of adapting vanilla ViT.

4. Experiments show MIMDet enables strong performance from a MIM pre-trained vanilla ViT, while being efficient and introducing a smaller gap between pre-training and fine-tuning compared to approaches like window attention.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective and efficient way to unlock the potential of MIM pre-trained vanilla ViT for high-performance object detection, without too much task-specific architectural modification. The results suggest the strong ViT representations can be unleashed with the right adaptations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to efficiently adapt a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection by feeding the ViT encoder with only randomly sampled partial input embeddings and using a compact convolutional stem, enabling the ViT to achieve strong performance on COCO while being efficient.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in adapting vision transformers (ViTs) for object detection:

- This paper focuses specifically on adapting Masked Image Modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla ViTs, like MAE, for object detection. Many other works have focused on supervised pre-training or on adapting hierarchical ViTs like Swin Transformers. Adapting MIM-pre-trained vanilla ViTs is still relatively underexplored.

- The approach feeds only partial, randomly sampled input embeddings to the ViT encoder during fine-tuning. This is quite different from previous works that typically feed the full input or use window partitioning. The motivation is to introduce less discrepancy from pre-training and leverage the pre-trained representations more judiciously.

- It replaces the pre-trained patchify stem with a small randomly initialized convolutional stem for hierarchical features. Most works retain the full pre-trained backbone. Replacing parts of the backbone is an interesting idea to build custom feature hierarchies.

- Without modifications like window attention, this achieves strong results competitive or superior to hierarchical ViTs. It also shows better efficiency than a prior work adapting vanilla ViTs. This helps demonstrate the power of MIM-pre-trained vanilla ViTs.

- There is limited exploration of different MIM frameworks beyond MAE. Expanding beyond MAE could be interesting future work.

Overall, this paper introduces some novel ideas for unlocking the potential of MIM-pre-trained vanilla ViTs for object detection. The competitive results highlight the promise of this direction. It provides a uniquely sparse, sampling-based approach compared to prior works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Scaling up the MIMDet model to larger sizes. The authors observe a promising scaling trend between the ViT model size and detection accuracy, so they suggest continuously scaling up MIMDet as future work.

- Exploring the properties of the MAE decoder during pre-training. The authors point out that what the MAE decoder learns is still unclear, so understanding its properties could be an interesting research direction. 

- Adapting other MIM frameworks besides MAE. The authors mainly studied MAE for pre-training, but suggest exploring the integration of other advances in masked image modeling into the MIMDet framework.

- Pre-training typical ConvNets like ResNet with MIM. The authors propose it may be possible to pre-train ConvNets with MIM by using a modified patchify stem, which could be explored.

- Applying MIMDet to other visual recognition tasks beyond object detection, such as instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, etc. The general methodology of MIMDet could potentially benefit these other tasks.

- Leveraging powerful general visual representations from vanilla ViT for other computer vision tasks. The authors suggest this work could encourage exploring the usage of pre-trained vanilla ViT representations more broadly.

In summary, the main future directions are centered around scaling up MIMDet, studying the pre-trained MAE model properties, extending MIMDet to other MIM frameworks and tasks, and unleashing vanilla ViT representations for more vision applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper presents an approach to efficiently adapt a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection. The key ideas are 1) Feed the ViT encoder with only randomly sampled partial input embeddings rather than the full input during fine-tuning, which reduces compute while still achieving strong performance. 2) Replace the pre-trained large kernel patchify stem with a compact randomly initialized convolutional stem to generate multi-scale features for a feature pyramid network, creating a ConvNet-ViT hybrid architecture.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach to efficiently adapt a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection. The key ideas are: 1) Feed the pre-trained ViT encoder with only a randomly sampled subset of the input patch embeddings rather than the full set of embeddings. Surprisingly, using only 25-50% of the input results in very strong performance. This works because the ViT can process non-consecutive input subsets and visual signals have high spatial redundancy. 2) Replace the pre-trained patchify stem with a small randomly initialized convolutional stem to generate multi-scale features. The convolutional stem outputs serve directly as inputs to the feature pyramid network, avoiding manipulations like upsampling ViT features. 

Overall, the method results in a ConvNet-ViT hybrid architecture where ViT is only the 3rd stage feature extractor. This enables leveraging the strong MIM pre-trained ViT representations for object detection with low overhead. Experiments on COCO show the approach, called MIMDet, outperforms hierarchical transformers like Swin by 2.5 box AP with faster convergence. The results demonstrate designing custom backbones may no longer be needed given MIM pre-trained vanilla ViTs. The work shows promising directions to better adapt powerful general visual representations from ViT for downstream tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents an approach to efficiently adapt a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection. The key ideas are:

1) Feed the pre-trained ViT encoder with only a partial, randomly sampled subset of the input sequence of embeddings during fine-tuning, e.g. only 25%-50% of the input. The output sequence fragments are complemented with learnable tokens and processed by a lightweight decoder to recover the full feature map. 

2) Replace the pre-trained large kernel patchify stem with a compact randomly initialized convolutional stem to produce hierarchical features to serve as inputs for a standard feature pyramid network, without needing to manipulate or upsample ViT's features. 

The resulting detector, called MIMDet, treats the vanilla ViT encoder as only the 3rd stage in a ConvNet-ViT hybrid backbone. This enables efficient adaptation and achieves strong COCO detection results, outperforming hierarchical Transformers with less training. The approach optimizes accuracy and efficiency while introducing a smaller gap between pre-training and fine-tuning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing how to effectively adapt a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection. Specifically, it aims to unleash the potential of MIM pre-trained ViT representations for high-performance object detection without needing to modify the pre-training process or architectural design of vanilla ViT.

The key questions/problems it tackles are:

- How can a vanilla ViT model pre-trained via MIM on image patches/tokens be effectively fine-tuned for object detection tasks that require high-resolution inputs? The quadratic scaling of self-attention makes it inefficient for vanilla ViT to directly process high-resolution images.

- How to construct a multi-scale feature pyramid from a single-scale pre-trained ViT to meet the requirements of standard object detection frameworks? Vanilla ViT lacks an inherent pyramidal feature hierarchy unlike CNNs or hierarchical ViTs.

- How to adapt a vanilla ViT pre-trained on 1D partial sequences via MIM for object detection without a discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning? Techniques like window attention treat inputs as 2D grids which vanilla ViT wasn't pre-trained on.

- How to unleash the representational capacity of MIM pre-trained vanilla ViT to achieve strong performance on object detection with modest training recipes?

In summary, the key focus is efficiently adapting MIM pre-trained vanilla ViTs for high-performance object detection while retaining its original architecture and pre-training approach.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents an approach to efficiently adapt a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection. The authors make two key observations: (1) A MIM pre-trained ViT encoder can perform surprisingly well on object recognition tasks even when using only a small random subset of input embeddings (e.g. 25%-50%). (2) To construct a feature pyramid from the single-scale ViT for detection, a small randomly initialized convolutional stem can replace the pre-trained patchify stem and provide hierarchical features to a FPN, treating the ViT encoder as just the 3rd stage of the backbone. Based on this, they propose MIMDet which feeds the ViT encoder a random subset of input embeddings and recovers the full output with a lightweight MAE-pre-trained decoder. With a convolutional stem providing multi-scale features to a FPN, this enables competitive detection performance, outperforming Swin Transformers. A key advantage is introducing a smaller gap between pre-training and fine-tuning compared to using window attention. Experiments on COCO show MIMDet outperforms prior arts in accuracy and efficiency. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential for unleashing self-supervised ViTs for detection via simple adaptations.
