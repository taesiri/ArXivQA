# Tool Learning with Foundation Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, this paper does not seem to have a clearly stated central research question or hypothesis. The paper appears to be a broad review and discussion of the paradigm of tool learning with foundation models. It provides background on tool learning and foundation models, discusses the complementary roles of tools and foundation models, outlines a general framework for tool learning, reviews existing research, and highlights open challenges and future directions. The paper does not present any new models or methods, nor does it appear to test a specific hypothesis through experiments. Rather, it aims to synthesize the current state of research at the intersection of tool learning and foundation models. The closest statements to research questions seem to be:- How can we enable foundation models to leverage the strengths of specialized tools to accomplish complex tasks? (Introduction)- How can models learn to effectively utilize tools? (Training Models section) - How can we facilitate the generalization of tool learning? (Generalizable Tool Learning section)In summary, this paper provides a broad overview and analysis of tool learning with foundation models, but does not have a clearly defined central research question or hypothesis that it sets out to address empirically. The main contribution appears to be consolidating and reviewing the landscape of work in this emerging field.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper appears to be presenting a comprehensive investigation and review of tool learning with foundation models. Specifically, the paper:- Provides background on the cognitive origins of tool use, categories tools based on their user interface, and discusses the paradigm shift enabled by foundation models. - Formulates a general framework for tool learning comprising four key components: tool set, environment, controller, and perceiver.- Reviews existing tool learning research and highlights core problems like intent understanding, tool understanding, planning, and training strategies.- Presents experiments with 18 tools to demonstrate the efficacy of current foundation models in tool use.- Discusses open challenges and future directions for tool learning research, including safety, large complex systems, tool creation, personalization, knowledge conflicts, etc.In summary, the key contribution is providing a systematic study of the emerging paradigm of tool learning with foundation models. The paper summarizes progress, formulates a general framework, highlights challenges, and lays out an agenda for future work in this area.
