# [Aya Model: An Instruction Finetuned Open-Access Multilingual Language   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have focused on a few data-rich languages, leaving many languages underserved. This limits accessibility and usefulness of LLMs for non-English speakers. 
- Existing multilingual LLMs have limited language coverage (46 for mT0, 26 for Okapi) or use English instructions/templates.
- Evaluations of multilingual LLMs are limited to a few languages and tasks. Safety and bias evaluations are predominantly done only for English.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Aya, a new 101 language instruction-finetuned LLM covering over 50\% lower-resourced languages.
- Create a 203M sample training mixture from diverse sources like xP3x, Aya dataset, translated data, and synthetic data. 
- Perform extensive data filtering, weighting ablations to balance quality and diversity.
- Expand evaluation to 99 languages and multiple axes like unseen tasks, translation, QA, human preference, etc.
- Benchmark toxicity and bias via identity prompts and translations in 18 languages. 
- Apply safety mitigations like context distillation to reduce harm by 78-89\%.

Main Contributions:
- Release an open-source multilingual LLM with much wider language coverage than prior work.
- Introduce comprehensive multilingual evaluations covering different tasks and languages. 
- Demonstrate techniques to balance language/data quality and instruction diversity.
- Analyze tradeoffs between model safety and performance in a multilingual context.
- Establish new state-of-the-art in massively multilingual language modeling while highlighting avenues for future work.

The paper makes an important step towards democratizing access to large language models by incorporating more languages, especially lower-resourced ones. It also sets up frameworks for rigorous multilingual evaluation and safety assurance.
