# [HIRI-ViT: Scaling Vision Transformer with High Resolution Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11999)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Scaling up Vision Transformers (ViTs) with high-resolution image inputs can enhance model capacity and performance, but inevitably suffers from heavy computational overhead as cost scales quadratically with input resolution. The goal is to design a ViT backbone that enables cost-efficient scaling with high-resolution inputs.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new 5-stage ViT backbone called HIRI-ViT (HIgh-Resolution Inputs ViT) with specialized building blocks to address this problem. Key ideas:

1) High Resolution Stem (HR-stem): Remodels standard Conv-stem to have parallel branches - a lightweight high-res branch and a heavier low-res branch to reduce cost.

2) High Resolution Block (HR-block): Replaces Transformer blocks in early stages with lighter blocks, again using parallel high-res and low-res branches for efficiency. 

3) Inverted Residual Downsampling (IRDS): Uses upgraded downsampling strategy between stages to stabilize training.

4) Switches normalization from LayerNorm to BatchNorm in early layers to enable faster inference.

5) New exponential moving average distillation to enhance training.

Together, these designs allow HIRI-ViT to efficiently handle high-resolution inputs without the quadratic computational increase faced by prior ViTs.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes first ViT specially designed for high-resolution inputs with favorable efficiency.

- Introduces novel 5-stage architecture and building blocks decomposing ops over dual high/low-res branches.

- Extensive experiments show accuracy gains over state-of-the-art ViTs under similar computational budgets.

- With comparable cost to prior ViTs with 224x224 inputs, HIRI-ViT with 448x448 inputs obtains new best ImageNet accuracy.

In summary, the paper makes ViTs compatible with high-resolution inputs for the first time via a principled redesign, unlocking accuracy gains at little additional computational overhead.
