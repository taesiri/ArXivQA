# [HIRI-ViT: Scaling Vision Transformer with High Resolution Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11999)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Scaling up Vision Transformers (ViTs) with high-resolution image inputs can enhance model capacity and performance, but inevitably suffers from heavy computational overhead as cost scales quadratically with input resolution. The goal is to design a ViT backbone that enables cost-efficient scaling with high-resolution inputs.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new 5-stage ViT backbone called HIRI-ViT (HIgh-Resolution Inputs ViT) with specialized building blocks to address this problem. Key ideas:

1) High Resolution Stem (HR-stem): Remodels standard Conv-stem to have parallel branches - a lightweight high-res branch and a heavier low-res branch to reduce cost.

2) High Resolution Block (HR-block): Replaces Transformer blocks in early stages with lighter blocks, again using parallel high-res and low-res branches for efficiency. 

3) Inverted Residual Downsampling (IRDS): Uses upgraded downsampling strategy between stages to stabilize training.

4) Switches normalization from LayerNorm to BatchNorm in early layers to enable faster inference.

5) New exponential moving average distillation to enhance training.

Together, these designs allow HIRI-ViT to efficiently handle high-resolution inputs without the quadratic computational increase faced by prior ViTs.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes first ViT specially designed for high-resolution inputs with favorable efficiency.

- Introduces novel 5-stage architecture and building blocks decomposing ops over dual high/low-res branches.

- Extensive experiments show accuracy gains over state-of-the-art ViTs under similar computational budgets.

- With comparable cost to prior ViTs with 224x224 inputs, HIRI-ViT with 448x448 inputs obtains new best ImageNet accuracy.

In summary, the paper makes ViTs compatible with high-resolution inputs for the first time via a principled redesign, unlocking accuracy gains at little additional computational overhead.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new five-stage Vision Transformer backbone with high-resolution inputs called HIRI-ViT, which decomposes typical CNN operations into parallel high-resolution and low-resolution branches to achieve better performance-computation tradeoffs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new five-stage Vision Transformer backbone, namely HIRI-ViT, for efficiently scaling up CNN+ViT hybrid models to handle high-resolution image inputs. Specifically, the key ideas include:

1) Decomposing typical CNN operations in the backbone into two parallel branches - a high-resolution branch with fewer ops and a low-resolution branch with more ops. This allows preserving the benefits of high-resolution inputs while reducing computational costs. 

2) Using this two-branch design to construct a High Resolution Stem (HR-stem) block and High Resolution (HR) blocks in the early stages to enable cost-efficient encoding of high-resolution features.  

3) Extending the typical 4-stage ViT backbone to 5 stages, with the above blocks in early stages, to better trade off accuracy and efficiency for high-resolution inputs.

4) Experiments on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HIRI-ViT backbone over state-of-the-art CNN and ViT models under comparable computational budgets.

In summary, the main contribution is an elegant CNN+ViT backbone that can efficiently scale to high-resolution imagery and lead to accuracy improvements on multiple vision tasks.
