# [VGA: Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network for Rumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spread of rumors with manipulated images or text concealed in images is a critical issue on social media. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods have limitations:
1) Do not explore visual tampering features or text in images. 
2) Ignore comments and propagation structures which provide wisdom of crowds.
3) Do not measure similarity between modalities. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) that:
1) Extracts semantic features from RGB images and tampering features from noise images using SRM filter. Also extracts text from images using OCR.
2) Models propagation structure of each claim as a graph and enhances interaction between root node and other nodes using co-attention. Performs data augmentation on graph. 
3) Measures similarity between graph and visual features using cosine similarity loss to guide parameter learning.
4) Fuses graph and visual features using co-attention and classifies claims.

Main Contributions:  
- Introduces noise images and OCR text extraction to capture tampering and concealed text.
- Models propagation structure more effectively using graph representation and root enhancement.
- Measures similarity between graph and visual features.
- Proposes an end-to-end architecture VGA that fuses graph and visual features for rumor detection.
- Constructs a large multimodal rumor dataset DRWeiboMM.
- Experiments show VGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly on three real-world datasets.

In summary, the paper explores graph and visual features more effectively and fuses them in an unified framework for accurate multimodal rumor detection. The proposed VGA model achieves new state-of-the-art performance.
