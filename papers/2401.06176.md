# [GOODAT: Towards Test-time Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) perform well on in-distribution (ID) graph data seen during training, but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) graphs. Existing methods for graph OOD detection rely on retraining GNNs or accessing the original training data, limiting their applicability. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper introduces GOODAT, a novel test-time graph OOD detection method that operates on the test data alone without changing the GNN architecture or needing the training data. GOODAT uses a lightweight graph masker module consisting of parameterized matrices to extract an informative subgraph from each test graph. The masker is optimized using three unsupervised losses based on the graph information bottleneck principle to maximize mutual information between the subgraph and the graph's surrogate ID label, while minimizing overlap between the subgraph and the masked graph. This enables capturing distinct patterns between ID and OOD subgraphs for detection.

Main Contributions:
1) Pioneers the test-time learning paradigm for graph OOD detection that enables training only on test data.
2) Proposes GOODAT, an effective test-time solution using a graph masker and unsupervised losses to distinguish OOD graphs.
3) Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple graph dataset benchmarks compared to existing methods.

The key advantage of GOODAT is its Independence from training data and GNN architecture changes, making it widely applicable. The unsupervised losses allow optimized OOD detection without labels. Comprehensive experiments validate the superiority over strong baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes GOODAT, a novel test-time graph out-of-distribution detection method that uses a graph masker and GIB-boosted losses to effectively distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution graphs without accessing the training data or modifying the target GNN model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are three-fold:

1. It pioneers the learning paradigm of test-time graph out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, unveiling a fresh perspective. This innovative paradigm sheds light on lightweight, training data-independent, and plug-and-play solutions for graph OOD detection that can seamlessly apply to any well-trained graph neural network (GNN) models.

2. It proposes a simple yet effective method called GOODAT to solve the test-time graph OOD detection problem. Leveraging the graph information bottleneck principle, GOODAT captures informative subgraphs from each input test graph to enable accurate identification of OOD samples within the test dataset. 

3. It conducts extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenarios to verify the effectiveness and superiority of GOODAT over state-of-the-art baseline methods for graph OOD detection across diverse real-world benchmark datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a new test-time graph OOD detection method called GOODAT, which is lightweight, training-independent, plug-and-play, and shows superior performance over existing methods.
