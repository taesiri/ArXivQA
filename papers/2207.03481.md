# [Training Transformers Together](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03481)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper demonstrates collaborative training of a text-to-image transformer model similar to DALL-E over the internet. The authors modified DALL-E to improve communication and memory efficiency for distributed training. They used techniques like weight tying, reversible layers, and low-precision numerics. The model was trained on 100 million image-text pairs from the LAION-400M dataset using the distributed training method from Dettmers et al. (2021). Besides the authors, 37 volunteers contributed compute time over 2.5 months of training. The resulting model generates somewhat realistic images for certain prompts, but fails to capture correct shapes for others. The authors attribute this to the model's small size compared to the enormous diversity in the training data. Overall, this paper shows both the potential and remaining challenges of collaboratively training large transformer models across heterogeneous internet-connected devices. The demonstration helps make such large-scale distributed training more accessible.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper demonstrates collaborative training of a text-to-image transformer model similar to DALL-E over the internet. The authors set up infrastructure for people to contribute compute to the training process. They addressed engineering challenges like slow communication speeds, limited memory budgets, uneven hardware performance, and security concerns. The model was trained on 100 million image-text pairs from the LAION-400M dataset using efficient techniques like gradient compression, parameter sharing, and quantization. Over 2.5 months, 37 volunteers contributed compute time alongside the authors. The resulting model can generate fairly realistic images for some prompts, but struggles with drawing correct shapes for others. The work shows the feasibility of collaboratively training large models without expensive infrastructure.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on reviewing the introduction and abstract of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we train large transformer models (like DALL-E) collaboratively over the internet by pooling compute resources from many independent parties, while overcoming engineering challenges like slow communication, limited memory, uneven device performance, and security?

The authors attempt to address this question by:

1) Modifying the DALL-E model architecture to make it more communication and memory efficient. 

2) Setting up infrastructure and instructions for collaborative training over the internet.

3) Discussing techniques to handle challenges like slow communication, memory constraints, heterogeneous hardware, and security.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several contributions to the field of collaborative and distributed training of large deep learning models:

- It provides practical engineering solutions to challenges like slow communication, limited memory budgets, and heterogeneous hardware for training models like DALL-E across many devices collaboratively. Techniques discussed include gradient compression, parameter sharing, dataset streaming, and memory-efficient training.

- The authors set up an actual collaborative training run of a DALL-E-like model and share instructions for others to join. This demonstrates the feasibility of collaborative training in practice.

- Compared to other work on collaborative training like Hivemind and DEDLOC, this paper focuses more on engineering solutions and providing practical tutorials and code for setting up such training. It also explores collaborative training of generative vision models specifically.

- The interactive memory calculator tool provides a useful visualization for understanding memory footprints of different models and optimizers. This is a nice practical contribution.

Overall, this paper makes collaborative training more accessible by providing lots of practical engineering know-how and tutorials alongside an actual collaborative training demo. It complements other theoretical and systems-focused work on distributed training with an engineering and educational perspective.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Developing new communication-efficient distributed training algorithms that work well over slow internet connections. The paper mentions this is an open research problem.

- Exploring new techniques for model and gradient compression to reduce communication costs and memory usage in distributed training. The paper discusses some existing techniques like 8-bit quantization and PowerSGD but suggests more work can be done. 

- Improving security and robustness of distributed training systems, for example by authenticating participants and using aggregation methods robust to outliers/attacks. The paper mentions this as an important consideration.

- Scaling up collaborative training runs to even larger models, datasets and numbers of participants. The paper demonstrates collaborative training for a 1.1B parameter model, but suggests going bigger is an interesting direction.

- Applying collaborative training to additional domains beyond NLP and computer vision, which are the main focus in the paper.

- Making the infrastructure and workflows around collaborative training more accessible and easy-to-use for more participants. The paper provides some tools and recipes but more work can be done here.

In summary, the key future directions are around scaling up collaborative training along multiple axes like model size, data size and number of participants, while also improving efficiency, robustness and accessibility of the systems.
