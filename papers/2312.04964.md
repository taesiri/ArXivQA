# [ZePT: Zero-Shot Pan-Tumor Segmentation via Query-Disentangling and   Self-Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04964)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical imaging datasets often have a long-tail distribution where there are many common conditions but few rare diseases. This makes it challenging to train universal segmentation models that can handle both common and rare tumors.
- Obtaining labeled data for every possible tumor type is expensive and time-consuming. Zero-shot learning is needed where models can segment novel unseen tumors without requiring examples during training.

Proposed Method (ZePT):  
- ZePT disentangles object queries into two sets - fundamental queries for organ segmentation and advanced queries for tumor segmentation.

- Stage 1 pretrains fundamental queries via an object-aware feature grouping method to segment organs. This captures organ-level semantics.

- Stage 2 trains advanced queries guided by visual prompts derived from fundamental queries to focus on subtle tumor-related visual cues.

- Anomaly score maps are generated indicating potential tumor locations. These act as self-generated visual prompts. 

- Prompt-based masked attention enables advanced queries to focus on prompt-highlighted regions to better capture tumors.

- Cross-modal alignment between text embeddings of anatomical structures and visual query features provides weak supervision.

Contributions:
- Novel query-disentangling framework tailored for zero-shot tumor segmentation

- Self-prompting strategy to explicitly model tumor visual cues to improve localization

- Feature-level alignment with medical text knowledge to enhance generalization

- Significantly outperforms previous methods on multi-organ and zero-shot tumor segmentation

- Consistently accurate segmentation of both common and rare tumor types, demonstrating robustness

In summary, ZePT advances zero-shot tumor segmentation via innovative query training strategies and cross-modal knowledge alignment. Experiments validate its superior performance and robustness.
