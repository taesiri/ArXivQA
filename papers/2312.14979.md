# [Stacked tensorial neural networks for reduced-order modeling of a   parametric partial differential equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14979)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers a parametric partial differential equation (PDE) with three independent variables (x, y, w) and three parameters (l, a1, a2). The PDE describes the transport of a probability density function f(x,y,w) along a direction w that varies spatially. The goal is to efficiently predict the steady-state solution f for different values of the parameters. This is challenging for traditional PDE solvers due to the curse of dimensionality.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a stacked tensorial neural network (STNN) architecture to approximate the mapping from parameters and boundary conditions to the PDE solution. The key components are:

1) Tensor networks, which are efficient reduced order models for the linear PDE problem with fixed parameters. They approximate the dense linear transform mapping boundary conditions to the solution.

2) Parameter embedding layers, which map the 3 parameters (l, a1, a2) to a higher dimensional space in order to model their influence on the solution. 

3) A stacking operation, which sums weighted outputs from multiple tensor networks. This increases the model capacity to represent diverse parameter-dependent behavior.

4) A preprocessing layer, which enforces rotational symmetry and locality.

Together, these components enable the STNN to achieve high accuracy in predicting solutions over a wide parameter range, even generalizing outside the training data.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel architecture combining tensor networks and deep learning that can accurately emulate solutions of a parametric, multidimensional PDE

- Demonstrates meaningful generalization outside training data, suggesting the model captures true parameter dependencies 

- Benchmarking shows dramatic (1000-4000x) speedups compared to traditional PDE solvers

- Analysis of model limitations provides insight into the representational capacity of reduced order neural networks for PDEs

The STNN approach shows promise for creating fast yet accurate surrogates for use in real-time applications or to accelerate computations in uncertainty quantification, optimization, and inverse problems.
