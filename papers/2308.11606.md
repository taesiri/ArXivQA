# [StoryBench: A Multifaceted Benchmark for Continuous Story Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11606)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it seeks to address is:

How can we create a comprehensive benchmark to reliably measure progress in video generation from sequences of text prompts (i.e. stories) over time?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new benchmark called StoryBench for evaluating text-to-video models on their ability to generate continuous, natural videos from sequences of text prompts. 

- Current video datasets only have single captions describing an entire video, whereas StoryBench contains detailed per-action captions with timestamps forming coherent stories.

- The benchmark consists of three datasets, three tasks of increasing difficulty, and three evaluation setups (zero-shot, single-task, multi-task) for thorough assessment.

- The authors collect rich human annotations including action descriptions, timestamps, mouse traces, and failure mode labels on thousands of open-domain videos.

- They also devise an automatic pipeline to transform existing video captions into detailed stories to create better training data.

- The paper establishes compact baselines, human evaluation guidelines, and proposes automatic metrics to enable reproducible comparisons going forward.

In summary, the key research question is how to design a comprehensive, multifaceted benchmark to drive progress and reliable evaluation of text-to-video models on the challenging task of continuous story visualization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1) Introducing StoryBench, the first benchmark for continuous story visualization from text prompts. It contains rich human annotations and allows evaluating text-to-video models on different tasks, datasets, and evaluation setups.

2) Devising an automatic procedure to transform existing video captions into sequences of action descriptions to create better training data.

3) Establishing strong baselines, human evaluation guidelines, and automatic metrics for the benchmark. 

4) Conducting experiments that show the benefits of fine-tuning text-to-video models for video continuation on story-like data. The results also reveal discrepancies between human and automated evaluation.

5) Providing data, code, and guidelines to inspire more research on real-world, controllable text-to-video generation of arbitrary length through a comprehensive and reproducible setup.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be the introduction of StoryBench, a new multifaceted benchmark for evaluating text-to-video models on continuous story visualization, enabled by rich human annotations and training data curation. The paper also provides baselines and evaluation methodologies for the community to build upon.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some thoughts on how it compares and relates to other research in the field:

- The paper tackles the challenging task of text-to-video generation, which is an active area of research as generative models for other modalities like images and audio continue to advance rapidly. This paper contributes to the growing literature on text-to-video generation.

- The main novelty of the paper is the creation of a new benchmark called StoryBench for evaluating text-to-video models, especially on their ability to generate coherent and consistent video "stories" from sequences of text prompts. Most prior datasets for text-to-video only contain single caption annotations per video. StoryBench provides multi-sentence annotated sequences.

- The paper compares several baseline models adapted from a prior text-to-video model called Phenaki. The benchmarks allow evaluating models in zero-shot, single-task, and multi-task setups. This provides a standardized framework for comparing different modeling approaches in future work.

- The paper highlights challenges like the lack of sufficient training data and issues with automatic evaluation metrics not aligning well with human judgments. These reflect general challenges in the field that many other papers grapple with as well.

- The multitask learning, human evaluation, and data augmentation/transformation aspects relate closely to techniques used in other recent papers on text-to-image generation and text-to-video generation.

- Overall, StoryBench seems to advance the state-of-the-art by providing more complex and naturalistic benchmarks compared to some prior synthetic or narrow-domain text-to-video datasets. The authors have taken care to build a multifaceted benchmark with human annotations and evaluations.

In summary, this paper pushes text-to-video benchmarks to better handle continuous stories, while also highlighting key challenges related to data, evaluation, and models that many other papers in this space grapple with. The benchmarks and experiments seem solidly executed based on conventions in the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more efficient protocols for collecting annotations of long videos to expand the benchmark to longer stories and videos. The current annotation framework used in this work does not scale well to very long videos.

- Training and benchmarking much larger text-to-video models, as the baselines used in this paper are quite modestly sized (345M parameters) compared to state-of-the-art image models (often 20B+ parameters). Scaling up video models presents challenges around computational efficiency. 

- Improving training methodologies and data augmentation strategies to better handle the paucity of video-text data compared to image-text data. The authors demonstrate simple data augmentation strategies can be beneficial, but more advanced techniques may help further.

- Expanding the diversity of videos in the benchmark to include more complex scene changes, cuts, camera movements, etc. to be more representative of professional filmmaking. The current videos are mostly single-shot user videos.

- Developing better automatic evaluation metrics, as the authors find a disconnect between human judgements and current metrics. More research is needed to create metrics that better correlate with human assessments.

- Unifying the capabilities of generating videos from scratch and continuing existing videos in a single model, as the authors find tradeoffs between these approaches when trained separately.

- Mitigating social biases and fairness issues that may emerge from models trained on web-scraped data exhibiting skewed demographics and viewpoints.

So in summary, the key directions involve improvements to data, models, training methods, evaluation metrics, and societal impacts to advance text-to-video generation research overall.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces StoryBench, a new benchmark for evaluating text-to-video models on their ability to generate coherent, continuous video stories from sequences of text prompts. The authors created StoryBench by collecting dense annotations on existing video datasets to provide action-by-action descriptions, timestamps, and diagnostic labels. StoryBench consists of three datasets, three tasks of increasing difficulty (action execution, story continuation, and story generation), and three evaluation setups (zero-shot, single-task, and multi-task). The authors trained a compact 345M parameter Phenaki text-to-video model and evaluated it on StoryBench in different ways, finding benefits in fine-tuning for video continuation rather than generation from scratch. They also devised an automatic pipeline to transform existing video captions into sequences of action descriptions to create better training data. The results showed discrepancies between human and automatic evaluation metrics, highlighting the need for better metrics. Overall, StoryBench aims to encourage progress on real-world, controllable text-to-video generation of arbitrary duration through its comprehensive and multifaceted design.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces StoryBench, a new benchmark for evaluating text-to-video generation models on their ability to create continuous, natural videos from sequences of text prompts. The benchmark consists of rich human annotations on three existing video datasets - DiDeMo, Oops, and UVO - totaling over 6,000 videos. The annotations include action-by-action textual descriptions, timestamps, mouse traces, and labels to identify potential failure modes. Based on this data, the paper defines three tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, story continuation, and story generation. Small yet strong baselines using a 345M parameter Phenaki model are trained and evaluated in zero-shot, single-task, and multi-task setups. Results show benefits from fine-tuning the model for video continuation rather than generation from scratch. However, discrepancies are found between human and automated evaluation metrics, highlighting the need for better metrics.

Overall, the paper introduces a multifaceted benchmark to drive progress in text-to-video generation for continuous story visualization. The rich human annotations and multiple tasks and datasets aim to systematically measure model capabilities and robustness. While limitations exist in video lengths and content variety, the benchmark provides a rigorous testbed to improve coherence, realism and controllability of generated videos. By releasing data, code and evaluation guidelines, the authors invite the community to participate in advancing video generation for creative applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes StoryBench, a new benchmark for evaluating text-to-video models on the task of continuous story visualization. To create the benchmark, the authors collected dense annotations for the validation and test sets of three existing video datasets - DiDeMo, Oops, and UVO. Human annotators described each video with a sequence of captions, one for each action, and provided timestamps. This resulted in datasets with rich annotations of video stories over time. The annotators also labeled each video segment with tags spanning 6 categories to easily analyze model failures. In addition, the authors devised an automatic pipeline to transform existing video captions into story-like sequences to generate better training data. Based on the collected annotations, the benchmark defines three tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, story continuation, and story generation. It also specifies three evaluation setups: zero-shot, single-task, and multi-task. The authors trained a 345M parameter Phenaki text-to-video model as a baseline, and evaluated it on the benchmark using both human ratings and automatic metrics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Generating high-quality, coherent videos from text prompts is challenging. Compared to image generation, video generation is more computationally expensive and requires maintaining consistency across frames. There is also less video-text training data available.

- The paper introduces a new benchmark called StoryBench to measure progress in video generation from sequences of text prompts (stories). This allows evaluating a model's ability to generate videos adhering to changing text over time.

- StoryBench contains rich human annotations of sequences of actions with timestamps for videos in 3 existing datasets (DiDeMo, Oops, UVO). It also has diagnostic labels to analyze model failures.

- The benchmark defines 3 tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, story continuation, and story generation. These require models to generate coherent videos conditioned on prior context.

- The authors train a small Phenaki text-to-video model as a baseline. They compare zero-shot, single task, and multi-task training.

- They establish guidelines for human evaluation on 5 criteria like visual quality and text adherence. They find human judgments reveal limitations not reflected in automatic metrics.

- The results show benefits from training the model on story-like data. But there is a gap between human preferences and current automatic metrics.

In summary, the key problem is generating coherent, realistic videos from sequences of changing text prompts over time. The paper introduces a rich benchmark to drive progress and reliable evaluation of text-to-video models on this challenging task.
