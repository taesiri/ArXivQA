# StoryBench: A Multifaceted Benchmark for Continuous Story Visualization

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it seeks to address is:How can we create a comprehensive benchmark to reliably measure progress in video generation from sequences of text prompts (i.e. stories) over time?The key points are:- The paper proposes a new benchmark called StoryBench for evaluating text-to-video models on their ability to generate continuous, natural videos from sequences of text prompts. - Current video datasets only have single captions describing an entire video, whereas StoryBench contains detailed per-action captions with timestamps forming coherent stories.- The benchmark consists of three datasets, three tasks of increasing difficulty, and three evaluation setups (zero-shot, single-task, multi-task) for thorough assessment.- The authors collect rich human annotations including action descriptions, timestamps, mouse traces, and failure mode labels on thousands of open-domain videos.- They also devise an automatic pipeline to transform existing video captions into detailed stories to create better training data.- The paper establishes compact baselines, human evaluation guidelines, and proposes automatic metrics to enable reproducible comparisons going forward.In summary, the key research question is how to design a comprehensive, multifaceted benchmark to drive progress and reliable evaluation of text-to-video models on the challenging task of continuous story visualization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1) Introducing StoryBench, the first benchmark for continuous story visualization from text prompts. It contains rich human annotations and allows evaluating text-to-video models on different tasks, datasets, and evaluation setups.2) Devising an automatic procedure to transform existing video captions into sequences of action descriptions to create better training data.3) Establishing strong baselines, human evaluation guidelines, and automatic metrics for the benchmark. 4) Conducting experiments that show the benefits of fine-tuning text-to-video models for video continuation on story-like data. The results also reveal discrepancies between human and automated evaluation.5) Providing data, code, and guidelines to inspire more research on real-world, controllable text-to-video generation of arbitrary length through a comprehensive and reproducible setup.In summary, the main contribution seems to be the introduction of StoryBench, a new multifaceted benchmark for evaluating text-to-video models on continuous story visualization, enabled by rich human annotations and training data curation. The paper also provides baselines and evaluation methodologies for the community to build upon.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review of the paper, here are some thoughts on how it compares and relates to other research in the field:- The paper tackles the challenging task of text-to-video generation, which is an active area of research as generative models for other modalities like images and audio continue to advance rapidly. This paper contributes to the growing literature on text-to-video generation.- The main novelty of the paper is the creation of a new benchmark called StoryBench for evaluating text-to-video models, especially on their ability to generate coherent and consistent video "stories" from sequences of text prompts. Most prior datasets for text-to-video only contain single caption annotations per video. StoryBench provides multi-sentence annotated sequences.- The paper compares several baseline models adapted from a prior text-to-video model called Phenaki. The benchmarks allow evaluating models in zero-shot, single-task, and multi-task setups. This provides a standardized framework for comparing different modeling approaches in future work.- The paper highlights challenges like the lack of sufficient training data and issues with automatic evaluation metrics not aligning well with human judgments. These reflect general challenges in the field that many other papers grapple with as well.- The multitask learning, human evaluation, and data augmentation/transformation aspects relate closely to techniques used in other recent papers on text-to-image generation and text-to-video generation.- Overall, StoryBench seems to advance the state-of-the-art by providing more complex and naturalistic benchmarks compared to some prior synthetic or narrow-domain text-to-video datasets. The authors have taken care to build a multifaceted benchmark with human annotations and evaluations.In summary, this paper pushes text-to-video benchmarks to better handle continuous stories, while also highlighting key challenges related to data, evaluation, and models that many other papers in this space grapple with. The benchmarks and experiments seem solidly executed based on conventions in the field.
