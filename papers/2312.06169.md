# [Bag of Tricks: Semi-Supervised Cross-domain Crater Detection with Poor   Data Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Crater detection on extraterrestrial planets is challenging due to lack of datasets, high sample complexity, and large domain differences between available datasets. 
- Existing models fail to achieve robustness and generalization across domains when trained on noisy, poor quality data.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Semi-supervised Crater Detection model with Poor Data Quality (SCPQ) to obtain a robust model with better cross-domain generalization. 
- Includes 3 main components:
  1) Fusing Shallow Information using Attention Mechanism (FSIAM): Fuses shallow feature maps with deep feature maps using attention modules to get better global context and handle multiscale craters.
  2) Pseudo-labeling and Data Augmentation Strategy (PDAS): Uses pseudo-labeling on target domain and different strength data augmentation on source vs target domain for better domain adaptation.  
  3) Smooth Hard Example Mining (SHEM) loss: Smooths hard example mining loss with L2 regularization for handling noisy data and improving generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Propose FSIAM to improve model robustness and scale adaptability with less/poor quality data
- Propose PDAS to mitigate domain distribution differences and improve generalization 
- Propose SHEM loss to enable learning from hard examples while preventing overfitting to noisy source domain
- Experiments show improved performance on DACD dataset, with 24.04% higher recall over baseline for cross-domain detection
- Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component

In summary, the paper tackles a very practical crater detection problem with limited real-world extraterrestrial data. It makes methodological contributions through attention-based feature fusion, pseudo-labeling, and a smoothed mining loss to achieve state-of-the-art cross-domain detection performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-supervised cross-domain crater detection model with attention mechanism for fusing shallow information, pseudo-labeling and data augmentation strategy, and smoothed hard example mining loss to improve performance and cross-domain generalization given poor quality extraterrestrial crater datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a method called Fusing Shallow Information Using Attention Mechanism (FSIAM) to fuse shallow feature maps with deep feature maps using attention modules. This is aimed at improving model robustness and receptive field when dealing with poor quality data. 

2) It proposes a pseudo-labeling and data augmentation strategy (PDAS) to adapt the model better across domains. This uses pseudo-labels from the target domain to fine-tune the model, and applies different augmentation strategies based on the noise levels in the source vs target domains.

3) It proposes a Smooth Hard Example Mining (SHEM) loss function to prevent overfitting on hard examples from the source domain during training. This uses L2 regularization on the hard example mining loss to smooth it and improve generalization. 

4) The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on the DACD crater detection dataset, especially for cross-domain generalization from DACD to the Lunar dataset. The recall is improved by 24.04% over baseline.

5) Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component FSIAM, PDAS and SHEM in improving model robustness, generalization and overall performance.

In summary, the main contribution is a set of techniques to adapt crater detection models to work better with poor quality data and generalize across domains, leading to SOTA cross-domain performance.
