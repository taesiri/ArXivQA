# [Bag of Tricks: Semi-Supervised Cross-domain Crater Detection with Poor   Data Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06169)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new model called SCPQ for improving crater detection performance, especially for cross-domain generalization, in the presence of scarce and poor-quality training data. The model has three main components. First, a Fusing Shallow Information method using Attention Mechanisms (FSIAM) fuses global shallow features from early backbone layers with deeper features to better represent multi-scale information. Second, a Pseudo-labeling and Data Augmentation Strategy (PDAS) leverages target domain pseudo-labels and tailored augmentation to align distributions across domains. Third, a Smooth Hard Example Mining (SHEM) loss function mines hard examples while regularizing to prevent overfitting. Experiments on crater detection datasets DACD and Lunar demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with a 24.04% recall improvement in the cross-domain Lunar setting. Ablations validate the contribution of each model component. The approach provides an effective framework for adapting models to new domains with limited and imperfect training data.
