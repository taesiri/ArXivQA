# [Bag of Tricks: Semi-Supervised Cross-domain Crater Detection with Poor   Data Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06169)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new model called SCPQ for improving crater detection performance, especially for cross-domain generalization, in the presence of scarce and poor-quality training data. The model has three main components. First, a Fusing Shallow Information method using Attention Mechanisms (FSIAM) fuses global shallow features from early backbone layers with deeper features to better represent multi-scale information. Second, a Pseudo-labeling and Data Augmentation Strategy (PDAS) leverages target domain pseudo-labels and tailored augmentation to align distributions across domains. Third, a Smooth Hard Example Mining (SHEM) loss function mines hard examples while regularizing to prevent overfitting. Experiments on crater detection datasets DACD and Lunar demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with a 24.04% recall improvement in the cross-domain Lunar setting. Ablations validate the contribution of each model component. The approach provides an effective framework for adapting models to new domains with limited and imperfect training data.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a method called Fusing Shallow Information Using Attention Mechanism (FSIAM) to improve model robustness and cross-domain generalization in the case of poor data quality. This is done by fusing shallow feature maps with deep feature maps using attention modules.

2) It proposes a pseudo-label and data augmentation strategy (PDAS) to adapt the model better across domains with large background differences. This uses pseudo-labels from the target domain for fine-tuning, along with different augmentation strategies based on the domain properties.

3) It proposes a Smooth Hard Example Mining (SHEM) loss function to improve model robustness by smoothing the hard example mining to prevent overfitting to the source domain.

4) The combined proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on the DACD crater detection dataset, with significant improvements in recall and mean average precision compared to baseline methods. The methods also generalize well when transferring between the DACD and Lunar crater datasets in both directions.

In summary, the main contribution is a set of techniques to improve cross-domain generalization for crater detection using attention mechanisms, augmentation strategies and a robust loss formulation to deal with scenarios of poor data quality.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Crater detection on extraterrestrial planets is challenging due to lack of datasets, high sample complexity, and large domain differences between available datasets. 
- Existing models fail to achieve robustness and generalization across domains when trained on noisy, poor quality data.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Semi-supervised Crater Detection model with Poor Data Quality (SCPQ) to obtain a robust model with better cross-domain generalization. 
- Includes 3 main components:
  1) Fusing Shallow Information using Attention Mechanism (FSIAM): Fuses shallow feature maps with deep feature maps using attention modules to get better global context and handle multiscale craters.
  2) Pseudo-labeling and Data Augmentation Strategy (PDAS): Uses pseudo-labeling on target domain and different strength data augmentation on source vs target domain for better domain adaptation.  
  3) Smooth Hard Example Mining (SHEM) loss: Smooths hard example mining loss with L2 regularization for handling noisy data and improving generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Propose FSIAM to improve model robustness and scale adaptability with less/poor quality data
- Propose PDAS to mitigate domain distribution differences and improve generalization 
- Propose SHEM loss to enable learning from hard examples while preventing overfitting to noisy source domain
- Experiments show improved performance on DACD dataset, with 24.04% higher recall over baseline for cross-domain detection
