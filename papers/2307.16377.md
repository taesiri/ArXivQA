# [JOTR: 3D Joint Contrastive Learning with Transformers for Occluded Human   Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16377)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve 3D human mesh recovery from single images, especially under occluded conditions?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Fusing 2D and 3D features can help achieve better 2D and 3D alignment of the reconstructed mesh, overcoming limitations when using only 2D features. 2) Adding global supervision to the 3D feature space, via a novel 3D joint contrastive learning approach, can help distinguish the target human from occlusions/background and produce more semantically meaningful 3D representations.The authors propose a new method called JOTR (3D Joint Contrastive learning with Transformers) to address these questions and test these hypotheses. The main contributions seem to be:- A transformer architecture to fuse 2D global image features and 3D local joint features for better 2D&3D alignment. - A 3D joint contrastive learning strategy with two losses - joint-to-joint and joint-to-non-joint contrast - to globally supervise the 3D space.- State-of-the-art results on occluded 3D human pose/mesh datasets like 3DPW, 3DPW-OC, 3DPW-PC etc. demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.In summary, the key research question is how to improve 3D human mesh recovery under occlusion, with the main hypotheses relating to fusing 2D/3D features and adding global 3D supervision via contrastive learning. The proposed JOTR method aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel framework called JOTR (3D Joint Contrastive Learning with Transformers) for recovering 3D human mesh from a single image, especially under occluded conditions. 2. Using an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to fuse 2D global features and 3D local features, which helps achieve both 2D and 3D alignment of the predicted mesh. This overcomes limitations of previous methods that relied mainly on 2D features/alignment.3. Introducing a 3D joint contrastive learning strategy with two contrastive losses - joint-to-joint and joint-to-non-joint contrast. This provides explicit global supervision for the 3D space to distinguish the human joints from occlusions/background. 4. Achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets - 3DPW, 3DPW-OC, 3DPW-PC, 3DOH, 3DPW-Crowd, CMU Panoptic. The method shows significant improvements especially for occluded human mesh recovery.5. Providing detailed experiments and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and contrastive learning strategy.In summary, the key novelties seem to be using transformers to fuse 2D and 3D features, and the 3D joint contrastive learning objective to globally supervise the 3D space. This results in improved performance on occluded human mesh recovery.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading, here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on 3D human mesh recovery from a single image:- It focuses on improving performance in occluded conditions, which many prior works struggle with. The proposed method aims to achieve better 2D and 3D alignment by fusing 2D global features and 3D local features. This allows using 3D information to help recover occluded parts.- It introduces a new 3D joint contrastive learning approach to provide global supervision for the 3D feature space. Most prior works rely only on 3D joint coordinates as local supervision. The contrastive learning gives a more holistic training signal.- It achieves state-of-the-art results on several occlusion-specific benchmarks like 3DPW-PC, 3DPW-OC, 3DOH, and also on the standard 3DPW benchmark. This demonstrates its effectiveness for occluded cases while maintaining strong overall performance.- The method uses an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to fuse the 2D and 3D features. This differs from prior works that use simpler fusion techniques like average pooling or sampling. The attention mechanism allows selectively focusing on relevant features.- For 3D feature learning, it proposes a new technique of using rescaled relative 3D coordinates compared to prior works that use MLPs or 3D convolutions. This encodes some inductive biases about the 3D space.Overall, the key novelties seem to be the transformer-based fusion approach, 3D joint contrastive learning, and strong results on occlusion benchmarks. The paper clearly advances the state-of-the-art in this field, especially for occluded human mesh recovery.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Improving the 3D localization and feature extraction modules to make the model more robust, especially for occluded cases. The authors mention that the current implementation uses simple MLPs and trilinear interpolation, which could be upgraded using more advanced techniques.- Exploring different fusion architectures and attention mechanisms for combining 2D and 3D features. The encoder-decoder transformer used in this work is a first attempt, but other variants could be studied as well.- Extending the 3D joint contrastive learning idea to other 3D representation learning tasks beyond human mesh recovery, such as 3D object detection/segmentation. The contrastive losses provide a general framework for global supervision of 3D spaces.- Training the model on a larger variety of datasets covering more poses, occlusion patterns, etc. to improve the generalization performance. The authors note limitations on more extreme poses due to lack of training data.- Combining bottom-up pose estimation methods to make the framework real-time capable for deployment. The top-down approach used currently relies on a slower human pose estimator.- Validating the approach on full-body mesh recovery instead of just the body from hips upwards. The SMPL model could be upgraded to SMPL-X.In summary, the main directions are improving the 3D components, exploring fusion architectures, extending 3D contrastive learning, increasing training data diversity, integrating bottom-up pose estimation, and testing on full body recovery. The paper provides a solid baseline and suggests promising avenues for future work in occluded human mesh estimation.
