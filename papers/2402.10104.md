# [GeoEval: Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs and Multi-Modal Models on   Geometry Problem-Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Geometry math problems require interpreting textual and visual information and applying mathematical reasoning, making them complex to solve with AI models.
- Existing geometry problem datasets lack standard format, diversity, and problem types like solid geometry. 
- Advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal models (MMs) show potential, but evaluation on geometry problems is lacking.

Proposed Solution - GeoEval Benchmark:
- Comprises 4 subsets - main (2000 problems), backward (750 problems), augmented (2000 problems), hard (300 problems).
- Features comprehensive variety (7 datasets), varied problems (flat, solid, analytic geometry), dual inputs (text/diagram), diverse challenges (backward, augmented, hard subsets), complexity ratings.

Experiments and Key Findings:
- Evaluated 10 LLMs and MMs: CodeGen2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, WizardMath, llava, Qwen-VL, mPLUG-Owl2, InstructBLIP, GPT-4V
- Math pre-training beneficial - WizardMath top performer (55.67% on main)
- GPT models better on self-rephrased problems  
- Diagram descriptions significantly help LLMs
- Performance declines as length/complexity increases

Main Contributions:
- Introduces comprehensive GeoEval benchmark for geometry problem solving evaluation
- Provides first quantitative assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs and MMs on geometry problems
- Reveals strengths (math pre-training) and weaknesses (backward reasoning, long/complex problems) of models
- Underscores need to test models on datasets they haven't seen during pre-training
- Findings will guide advancement of models' reasoning abilities

The paper makes an important contribution by creating and evaluating LLMs and MMs on the new GeoEval benchmark for geometry problem solving. Key findings point to benefits of math pre-training and self-rephrasing, but also challenges with complex reasoning that models still need to address.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces the GeoEval benchmark, a comprehensive collection of geometry math problems from diverse public datasets and newly generated subsets, designed to facilitate deeper investigation into large language models' and multi-modal models' performance in solving geometry math problems across varied complexity levels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the GeoEval benchmark, a comprehensive collection of geometry math problems specifically designed to facilitate the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal models (MMs) on their ability to solve geometry problems. 

Key aspects of the GeoEval benchmark highlighted in the paper include:

- It encompasses a diverse range of geometry problem types (flat, solid, analytic) sourced from multiple public datasets to provide broad coverage.

- It features four distinct subsets - GeoEval-2000, GeoEval-backward, GeoEval-aug, and GeoEval-hard - each designed to test different aspects of models' geometry problem-solving capabilities.

- It provides dual diagram + text and text-only inputs to enable assessment of both LLMs and MMs. 

- It incorporates complexity ratings to allow analysis of model performance across difficulty levels.

The paper then utilizes GeoEval to conduct a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 10 state-of-the-art LLMs and MMs. The key findings from these experiments showcase the current limitations of models in solving geometry problems, while also revealing promising directions, such as the benefit of self-rephrasing for GPT-series models.

Therefore, the main contribution is the introduction of the novel GeoEval benchmark itself, which facilitates advanced analysis of model capabilities, as demonstrated through the paper's experiments. GeoEval pushes forward geometry problem-solving research by offering a new standardized testbed for continued progress.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark called GeoEval for evaluating language models on geometry problem solving. What are the key motivations and gaps this benchmark aims to address compared to existing geometry problem datasets? 

2. GeoEval has four subsets - GeoEval-2000, GeoEval-backward, GeoEval-aug, and GeoEval-hard. Can you explain the rationale and methodology behind the creation of each subset? How do they complement each other in evaluating different aspects of geometry problem solving?

3. The paper evaluates several state-of-the-art language models on GeoEval using a zero-shot approach. Why was this evaluation methodology chosen over fine-tuning the models, and what are its advantages and disadvantages? 

4. The WizardMath models achieve the best performance on GeoEval-2000 but struggle more on other subsets. What explanations are provided in the paper for this performance difference? Does it reveal any limitations of pre-training on math corpora alone?

5. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 perform much better on GeoEval-aug compared to GeoEval-2000. What issue does this finding reveal about potential overfitting of large language models to existing datasets, and how does GeoEval-aug provide a solution?  

6. What analysis in the paper demonstrates the value of including geometric diagram descriptions in enhancing language models' understanding and problem solving efficiency? Can you suggest any potential ways to further improve the utilization of visual information?

7. How does the complexity annotation scheme introduced in GeoEval enable finer-grained analysis of model performance across difficulty levels? What trends does the analysis in the paper reveal about current language models in this regard?  

8. The paper analyzes model performance across different academic subjects within geometry. Can you summarize some key relative strengths and weaknesses identified among the models for different subjects like solid geometry?

9. One limitation mentioned is the focus on quantitative accuracy metrics over qualitative aspects of reasoning and explanation. What are some ways future work could incorporate more qualitative evaluation to provide insights beyond accuracy scores? 

10. The declining performance with increasing problem length and complexity suggests scalability issues in current models. What might be some promising research directions to tackle these challenges?
