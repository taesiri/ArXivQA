# [Robot Crowd Navigation in Dynamic Environment with Offline Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based robot crowd navigation methods require frequent interaction with pedestrians to collect exploration samples. This leads to two issues: 1) unsafe exploration that poses collision threats, and 2) low sampling efficiency during training. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an offline reinforcement learning algorithm for robot crowd navigation that utilizes pre-collected crowd navigation experiences. The key ideas are:

1) Modify the loss function in SARSA-style objective to avoid querying out-of-distribution actions beyond the pre-collected experiences. 

2) Integrate a spatial-temporal state transformer (ST2) into implicit Q-learning to effectively capture spatial-temporal features from offline pedestrian-robot interactions.

3) Provide a data collection scheme using ORCA with exploratory noise to create crowd navigation datasets.

Main Contributions:

1) The proposed algorithm eliminates unsafe exploration and improves sampling efficiency compared to online DRL methods.

2) Integrating ST2 with implicit Q-learning enables learning spatial-temporal features from offline experiences for efficient decision making.

3) Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art offline and online baselines in success rate, navigation time, cumulative reward and sampling efficiency.

4) The algorithm is validated in a simulated Gazebo environment with randomized pedestrian movements showing its practical applicability.

In summary, the key innovation is an offline reinforcement learning approach that modifies the SARSA loss and integrates spatial-temporal modeling to achieve safer and more efficient robot crowd navigation using pre-collected suboptimal interaction experiences.
