## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how the deep recurrent visual attention learner (DVRL) model compares to other visual attention models like slot attention in various visual reasoning tasks. The key hypothesis seems to be that the DVRL model will outperform other attention models like slot attention in complex visual reasoning tasks that require integrating information over time and handling partially observable states. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:1) The DVRL model will achieve superior sample efficiency compared to slot attention in tasks like CLEVR that involve complex reasoning with partial observability. 2) The DVRL model will exceed the performance of slot attention in tasks like visual question answering that require integrating information over time from an image.3) The partially observable DVRL model will approach or match the performance of the fully observable DVRL model as it is better able to handle partial observability.In essence, the central hypothesis is that the proposed DVRL model with its recurrent mechanisms and handling of partial observability will achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other attention models like slot attention across a range of visual reasoning tasks. The experiments and results are aimed at validating this hypothesis.
