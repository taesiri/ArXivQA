# [Pruning Compact ConvNets for Efficient Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04502)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) RQ1: Can pruning a larger FBNetV3 model (optimized with NAS) achieve higher generalization performance than a smaller FBNetV3 model, when the pruned model has the same computational budget (FLOPs)?2) RQ2: Is pruning a faster and less computationally expensive approach to obtain a high-accuracy model at a desired FLOPs level, compared to running a full neural architecture search from scratch?The key ideas seem to be:- FBNetV3 models are state-of-the-art efficient ConvNets optimized with NAS. This paper studies if they can be further improved via pruning.- The authors prune larger FBNetV3 models to the FLOPs levels of smaller models. The pruned larger models consistently outperform the smaller original models.- Pruning a larger model requires much less compute than running NAS from scratch to find a small model. So pruning is a efficient way to find compact high-accuracy models.In summary, the main hypotheses are that pruning can further optimize NAS-optimized efficient ConvNets like FBNetV3, and do so with lower compute than NAS. The paper appears to provide empirical evidence supporting both these claims.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It studies the effect of pruning techniques on state-of-the-art efficient vision models like FBNetV3. Prior work has focused more on pruning larger overparameterized models, but this paper specifically looks at models that are already optimized for efficiency. 2. It shows that pruning can further optimize models found through neural architecture search (NAS). The pruned models consistently achieve better accuracy than the original FBNetV3 models at the same FLOP count.3. It demonstrates that pruning larger models is a more efficient way to find efficient models compared to doing full NAS from scratch. Pruning only takes a fraction of the GPU hours of a full NAS.4. It provides benchmark results showing the latency-accuracy tradeoff of pruned models using real hardware. This reveals that while pruning reduces FLOPs, the impact on latency is smaller due to hardware limitations.In summary, the key contribution is showing that neural architecture search does not fully solve overparameterization, and judicious pruning can further enhance efficiency and accuracy of optimized vision models like FBNetV3. The paper also highlights the practical advantage of pruning over NAS in terms of computational overhead.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper shows that pruning larger pre-trained FBNetV3 models and fine-tuning obtains better efficiency vs accuracy trade-offs compared to smaller FBNetV3 models optimized by neural architecture search, while requiring significantly less computation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in efficient computer vision model design and neural network pruning:- This paper focuses specifically on applying pruning techniques to the FBNetV3 family of models. Most prior pruning work has focused on older models like VGGNet, ResNet, etc. So this provides a useful analysis of how pruning impacts state-of-the-art efficient ConvNets optimized by NAS.- A key contribution is demonstrating pruning can further improve the accuracy vs FLOPs trade-off curve over NAS-optimized models like FBNetV3. Many papers have shown pruning can compress overparameterized models, but less work has looked at its impact on networks already optimized for efficiency.- The paper compares pruning versus doing full NAS from scratch in terms of computation cost. This provides a useful practical insight - pruning a pretrained model can be 3-5x faster for obtaining a target efficiency level versus rerunning NAS. This is valuable for researchers with limited compute budgets.- For the pruning techniques, the paper uses standard approaches like magnitude-based pruning. The novelty is less in the techniques themselves, and more in the comprehensive analysis when applying it to efficient vision models.- Compared to methods that do joint architecture search with pruning, this paper takes a simpler and more practical approach of pruning a fixed pretrained architecture. So it trades off some potential accuracy gains for much lower compute cost.- Overall, a key distinction is the thorough analysis and benchmarks on the FBNetV3 family, going beyond most prior pruning papers which focus on older or non-specialized architectures. The computational cost insights are also novel and practically useful.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Investigating squeeze-excitation (SE) layers in more detail: The analysis in the paper showed that SE layers tend to get pruned significantly more than other layers, while also being less sensitive to high sparsity levels. The authors suggest revisiting the role of SE layers in FBNetV3 models, and potentially removing or modifying them to obtain further latency and computation benefits.- Exploring structured pruning approaches: The paper focused on unstructured magnitude-based pruning. However, structured techniques like channel pruning or layer pruning may allow further improvements to the latency-performance tradeoff. The design of structured sparse models that achieve good speedups is an open challenge.- Extending the techniques to other efficient model families: The experiments focused on the FBNetV3 models, but similar techniques could be applied to other optimized efficient models like EfficientNets to improve their accuracy-FLOPs tradeoff.- Integrating pruning into model search: The paper proposed pruning pretrained models, but integrating pruning into NAS/model search itself could find architectures specialized for sparse training. This could further boost efficiency.- Studying the combination of pruning with other compression techniques like quantization: Employing pruning along with quantization, low-rank approximations etc. could lead to higher compression rates and should be explored.- Developing hardware-aware pruning methods: Customizing pruning approaches by considering hardware characteristics and constraints could improve inference speedups and latency on targeted devices.So in summary, the key suggestions are to build on this work by exploring structured pruning, extending it to other model families, integrating it with neural architecture search, combining it with other compression techniques in an end-to-end manner, and developing hardware-aware pruning techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper analyzes the effect of pruning on the FBNetV3 family of efficient computer vision models that have been optimized using neural architecture search (NAS). The authors perform global and uniform magnitude-based pruning experiments on larger FBNetV3 models to reduce their parameters and FLOPs to match smaller models in the FBNetV3 family. They demonstrate that the pruned larger models can achieve better ImageNet accuracy than the smaller FBNetV3 models at the same FLOPs level, thus improving on the state-of-the-art computation vs performance tradeoff. The authors also show that pruning a larger FBNetV3 model requires much less GPU time (~4x reduction) to obtain a model at a target FLOPs level compared to a full NAS, making it an efficient paradigm when computational resources are limited. Overall, the work provides insights into how pruning can further optimize neural architecture search models and improve accuracy within a target computation budget.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper investigates using pruning techniques to further optimize neural networks that have already been designed for efficient inference, specifically the FBNetV3 family of models. The authors utilize global and uniform magnitude-based pruning on larger FBNetV3 models to reduce parameters and FLOPs. They show that the pruned larger models consistently achieve better performance than smaller baseline FBNetV3 models at the same computational budget. For example, pruning FBNetV3C to the FLOPs level of FBNetV3A results in 1.43% higher accuracy. This demonstrates that pruning can improve the computation vs performance tradeoff compared to neural architecture search alone. In addition to improved accuracy, the authors show pruning is far less computationally expensive for obtaining a performant efficient model compared to rerunning architecture search from scratch. Pruning and fine-tuning a larger model uses around 4x less GPU hours than neural architecture search to find a smaller model from scratch. Overall, this work provides strong evidence that pruning techniques can further enhance networks optimized for efficient inference. The pruned FBNetV3 models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy vs FLOPs tradeoffs on ImageNet.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper investigates pruning techniques to further optimize the FBNetV3 family of efficient neural network models that have already been optimized through neural architecture search (NAS). The authors apply both global magnitude-based pruning and uniform magnitude-based pruning to larger FBNetV3 models to reduce their parameters and FLOPs to match those of smaller models in the FBNetV3 family. For global pruning, all weights below a threshold are removed to meet a FLOPs target. For uniform pruning, each layer has a level-specific threshold so the pruned network achieves the target FLOPs with equal sparsity per layer. After pruning, the networks are fine-tuned until convergence. The pruned larger models consistently achieve better accuracy than the smaller original FBNetV3 models with the same FLOPs, demonstrating the potential of pruning to further optimize networks found through NAS. The study also shows pruning is far less computationally expensive than rerunning NAS to find efficient architectures from scratch.
