# [Analyizing the Conjunction Fallacy as a Fact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13615)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The conjunction fallacy (CF) has been extensively studied since Tversky and Kahneman's seminal 1983 paper, but research has focused narrowly on confirming its existence rather than fully exploring the space of possible experiences. 
- Only 37 out of over 4000 CF papers report well-documented experimental data on probability judgments of events A, B and A AND B. Analysis of 416 reported data points shows research has only covered a narrow subset of possible probability combinations.
- Potentially interesting cases like strong "double fallacies" with very low A and B probabilities but high A AND B probability are unexplored. This could provide evidence that rationality-based explanations are incomplete.

Proposed Solution:
- Adopt a factual paradigm that maps all possible combinations of probability judgments without assuming rational cognition. Explore the full space of possible experiences in human probability judgment. 
- Design experiments that allow respondents to make separate A, B and A AND B judgments without losing focus. This will provide more accurate data on the extremes of irrational judgments.

Main Contributions:
- Literature analysis showing CF research has narrowly focused on confirming CF over exploring full space of probability judgments
- Factual analysis framework that separates rationality assumptions from actual experience
- Calls for experiments designed to deeply explore non-rational cognition without assuming rational frameworks are complete
- Proposes connections of CF to ideas like synchronicity that bridge physics, psychology and non-rational modes of thought
