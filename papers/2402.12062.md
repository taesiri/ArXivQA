# [Causal Equal Protection as Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Causal Equal Protection as Algorithmic Fairness":

Problem:
- Classification parity, a common metric for algorithmic fairness, faces issues in several scenarios. It equates fairness with equalized rates of errors across groups, but this can fail to match moral intuitions about fair treatment of individuals.
- Examples show algorithms can violate classification parity without treating any individual unfairly, and vice versa. The issues are that classification parity (i) does not track if individuals can legitimately complain of unfair treatment, and (ii) does not consider if unfair treatment causally traces to a protected characteristic.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new principle called "causal equal protection" that avoids issues with classification parity. 
- The key idea is to equalize risks of erroneous classification for individuals rather than just equalizing rates of errors across groups. This enables tracking legitimate individual complaints about unfair treatment.
- A causal analysis is incorporated to assess if risks of errors for individuals trace to their protected characteristics. Comparative risk assessments consider causal relationships from protected categories to algorithmic classifications.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies limitations of classification parity through counterexamples, and traces issues to lack of concern for legitimate individual complaints and lack of causal analysis.
- Advances the principle of equal protection from philosophy of law, reframed around distributing risks of classification errors evenly across individuals.
- Incorporates causality into equal protection to support legitimate complaints tied to protected characteristics influencing classifications via causal paths. This yields the novel causal equal protection principle for algorithmic fairness.
- Compares causal accounts of fairness to argue causal equal protection directly addresses uneven error risk allocation rather than morally objectionable causal paths.   
- Discusses how diagnostic evidence responsive to outcomes may avoid some issues with predictive evidence under causal equal protection.

In summary, the paper significantly advances the discussion of algorithmic fairness by developing the novel principle of causal equal protection to overcome issues with classification parity. The integration of equalized risk, individual treatment, and causality appears to align well with moral intuitions about fairness.
