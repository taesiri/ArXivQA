# [Causal Equal Protection as Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Causal Equal Protection as Algorithmic Fairness":

Problem:
- Classification parity, a common metric for algorithmic fairness, faces issues in several scenarios. It equates fairness with equalized rates of errors across groups, but this can fail to match moral intuitions about fair treatment of individuals.
- Examples show algorithms can violate classification parity without treating any individual unfairly, and vice versa. The issues are that classification parity (i) does not track if individuals can legitimately complain of unfair treatment, and (ii) does not consider if unfair treatment causally traces to a protected characteristic.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new principle called "causal equal protection" that avoids issues with classification parity. 
- The key idea is to equalize risks of erroneous classification for individuals rather than just equalizing rates of errors across groups. This enables tracking legitimate individual complaints about unfair treatment.
- A causal analysis is incorporated to assess if risks of errors for individuals trace to their protected characteristics. Comparative risk assessments consider causal relationships from protected categories to algorithmic classifications.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies limitations of classification parity through counterexamples, and traces issues to lack of concern for legitimate individual complaints and lack of causal analysis.
- Advances the principle of equal protection from philosophy of law, reframed around distributing risks of classification errors evenly across individuals.
- Incorporates causality into equal protection to support legitimate complaints tied to protected characteristics influencing classifications via causal paths. This yields the novel causal equal protection principle for algorithmic fairness.
- Compares causal accounts of fairness to argue causal equal protection directly addresses uneven error risk allocation rather than morally objectionable causal paths.   
- Discusses how diagnostic evidence responsive to outcomes may avoid some issues with predictive evidence under causal equal protection.

In summary, the paper significantly advances the discussion of algorithmic fairness by developing the novel principle of causal equal protection to overcome issues with classification parity. The integration of equalized risk, individual treatment, and causality appears to align well with moral intuitions about fairness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new principle of algorithmic fairness, causal equal protection, which requires equalizing the risks of erroneous classifications across individuals based on an analysis of the causal relationships between protected characteristics, evidence used for classification, and outcomes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of a new principle for algorithmic fairness called "causal equal protection." The key ideas behind this principle are:

1) It focuses on equalizing the risks of erroneous classifications across individuals rather than equalizing the rates of errors across groups. This allows it to better capture unfairness at the individual level.

2) It explicitly incorporates causality into the assessment of risks. This allows it to distinguish between cases where a protected characteristic causally impacts the classification versus cases where there is merely a correlation.

3) It argues that the source of unfairness is the uneven allocation of risks rather than the existence of morally objectionable causal paths per se. This differs from some existing causal accounts.

4) It highlights the distinction between predictive and diagnostic evidence and argues that the latter may allow for screening off prejudicial influences without sacrificing accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is putting forward the principle of causal equal protection as a refinement over both classification parity and equal protection that relies more heavily on causal reasoning and the notion of uneven risk allocation. The paper aims to show how this principle aligns better with moral intuitions about fairness in various examples.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's content, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper include:

- fairness
- distributive justice  
- procedure
- equal protection
- bias
- risk
- evidence
- classification parity
- algorithmic fairness
- causal equal protection

The paper discusses principles and criteria for evaluating the fairness of algorithmic systems, particularly in contexts like criminal justice. It critiques the commonly used "classification parity" approach and proposes an alternative "causal equal protection" principle that aims to better capture intuitions about fair treatment of individuals. Key concepts in developing this alternative approach include assessing risks of classification errors, using causal models to represent relationships between protected attributes, outcomes, predictors etc., and distinguishing between predictive and diagnostic evidence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes replacing classification parity with causal equal protection. What is the key conceptual difference between these two principles? Why does causal equal protection fare better in capturing intuitions about fair treatment?

2. Equal protection places the source of unfairness in the uneven allocation of risks of misclassification across individuals. How does this differ from classification parity? Why is the notion of risk better suited than rates to assess unfairness at the individual level?  

3. The paper argues that risks should be assessed epistemically from an idealized point of view that combines information about the classification system and larger societal processes. What is this idealized point of view and why is it justified? How does it help address limitations of equal protection?

4. The paper introduces the distinction between predictive and diagnostic evidence. How are they conceptually and causally different? Why does diagnostic evidence fare better in terms of responsiveness to the world? 

5. The paper argues that diagnostic evidence avoids violations of causal equal protection in certain cases. Explain this argument and discuss its limitations. When can diagnostic evidence still violate causal equal protection?  

6. How exactly does adjusting the probative value of diagnostic evidence help avoid violations of causal equal protection in certain cases? Explain the mechanism behind this solution. What are its limitations?

7. Can the informational value of predictive evidence be retained while screening off its prejudicial influence? If not, why not? What trade-offs does this entail between predictive accuracy and fairness?

8. What role does the because-clause in the formulation of causal equal protection play? Why is it important to explicitly require that unequal risks should obtain "because" individuals possess certain protected characteristics?

9. The paper does not question the assumption that the standard of impartiality should be equal treatment for factually similar individuals. What objections have been raised against this assumption in the literature? How might they affect the proposed account?

10. The paper focuses on examples from criminal justice. What challenges arise in expanding the account of causal equal protection to other socially significant areas such as healthcare, education or housing? How might the theory need to be adapted?
