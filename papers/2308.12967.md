# [NeO 360: Neural Fields for Sparse View Synthesis of Outdoor Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12967)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How can we develop a neural representation that can synthesize high-fidelity novel views of complex outdoor scenes from just a few input views, without requiring per-scene optimization from many views like previous methods?The key ideas and contributions to address this question seem to be:1) Proposing a hybrid image-conditional triplanar representation to capture both local and global structure in a scene. This allows learning from many scenes while generalizing to novel views. 2) Introducing a large-scale 360 degree outdoor scene dataset (NeRDS 360) to enable learning strong priors for representing complete scenes.3) Demonstrating that their proposed method (NeO 360) outperforms previous techniques like PixelNeRF and MVSNeRF for few-shot novel view synthesis of both full scenes and individual objects.4) Showing their approach can decompose scenes for editing and re-rendering objects by sampling features inside known 3D bounding boxes.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a hybrid triplanar scene representation can enable high-fidelity novel view synthesis from very sparse inputs for complex outdoor scenes, which they demonstrate through quantitative and qualitative experiments.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key research question addressed in this paper is:How can we develop a neural representation that can effectively synthesize novel 360 degree views of complex outdoor scenes given only a sparse set of input views (e.g. 1-5 images)?The paper proposes a new method called NeO 360 that aims to address this challenge. The key ideas are:1) Using a hybrid image-conditional triplanar representation to capture information about the 3D scene from different perspectives. This allows learning from a large dataset of scenes while generalizing to novel views and scenes. 2) Combining global triplanar features with local residual features from input images to enable accurate novel view synthesis from very limited inputs.3) Training on a large-scale 360 degree outdoor scene dataset (NeRDS 360) to learn strong priors about complete 3D scenes. This enables few-shot generalization to new scenes.4) Allowing compositional scene editing by using ground truth bounding boxes to decompose scenes into individual objects and backgrounds.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed triplanar representation and hybrid global-local conditioning can enable effective generalization to novel 360 views of complex outdoor scenes from only a few sparse input views, using strong priors learned from diverse data. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural implicit representations for novel view synthesis:- The paper focuses on generalizing neural radiance fields like NeRF to outdoor, unbounded urban scenes. Most prior work has focused on indoor scenes or limited outdoor environments. So this expands the capability of neural rendering to more complex outdoor spaces.- A key limitation of NeRF is needing many input views per scene for good novel view synthesis. This paper aims to address that by learning from many scenes to build a strong prior, and then generating novel views of new scenes from very sparse inputs (1-5 images). This could significantly expand the practicality of neural rendering.- The proposed method uses a combination of local image features and global triplanar scene features to represent the full 360 degree environment. This hybrid representation is less common than pure voxel grids or view-based features used in other works. It may provide benefits of both by capturing all scene directions while remaining efficient.- For compositional modeling, the paper shows editing by isolating objects based on 3D boxes, without needing an object decomposition  during training like other works. This simplifies editing novel scenes.- The paper introduces a new large-scale outdoor scene dataset for this problem that will support more research on unbounded outdoor view synthesis.- Compared to concurrent work on generative models for novel view synthesis like GRAF and EG3D, this paper focuses more on conditional synthesis from limited real image inputs, rather than unconditional generation.Overall, the paper pushes neural scene modeling into more complex outdoor environments, while aiming to preserve the benefits of NeRF-like representations for controllable synthesis and editing. The hybrid scene representation and ability to generalize from sparse inputs could be notable contributions. More comparative results on recent datasets would help situate the advantages of this approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper presents a new method called NeO 360 for neural view synthesis of outdoor 360° scenes from sparse inputs. This addresses an important limitation of prior work like NeRF which requires many input views and per-scene optimization. - Other recent works have tried to make neural radiance fields more generalizable across scenes, such as PixelNeRF and MVSNeRF. However, results show that NeO 360 outperforms these methods quantitatively and qualitatively on the task of few-shot novel view synthesis.- A unique aspect of NeO 360 is the use of a hybrid local-global feature representation based on triplanar features. This combines strengths of voxel and BEV representations. Prior works like EG3D and GAUDI also use triplanar representations but rely on adversarial training and expensive GAN inversion.- The paper makes contributions in methodology through the novel architecture, introduces a new large-scale dataset of outdoor 360° scenes for this problem, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the challenging task of few-shot novel view synthesis.- Compared to other works focusing on single object reconstruction, NeO 360 handles full scene modeling and synthesis which is more complex. The compositional capabilities are also unique, allowing editing and re-rendering of objects.- Overall, the paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in making neural radiance fields more practical for complex real-world data where only limited observations may be available. The novel architecture, strong experimental results, and new dataset are significant contributions to this emerging research area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Explore how the proposed method can be used to build priors that rely less on labeled data like 3D bounding boxes during inference. Instead, use motion cues for effective scene decomposition without labeled data. This could improve the applicability of the method to real-world scenarios where dense annotations may not be available.- Extend the work to sim2real by using only labeled simulation data to train the models. Then apply it to real-world data to alleviate the need for large real-world datasets with annotations. Simulation can provide unlimited labeled data which can be used to pre-train models that generalize decently to real data.- Compare the proposed generative triplanar scene representation to other generative models like GANs. The paper mentions leaving these generative model comparisons to future work.- Apply the scene decomposition and editing capabilities to video applications like novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes. The current work focuses on static scene modeling and rendering.- Evaluate the approach on real captured outdoor datasets like KITTI-360 to study sim2real transfer of the models. The paper shows some initial real-world results but more extensive benchmarking on real data would be useful.- Explore alternatives to the triplanar scene representation such as octrees or other hybrid implicit-explicit forms. Compare their modeling capacity and computational tradeoffs.- Study how the number of source views affects modeling accuracy and develop view selection or planning methods to optimize sample efficiency.- Extend it to model lighting variations and textures for more realistic rendering. The current approach focuses primarily on geometry and appearance modeling.In summary, the main future directions are improving real-world applicability, comparisons to other generative models, video modeling, more real data experiments, alternatives to triplanes, and rendering enhancements.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new approach called NeO 360 for generating 360-degree novel views of complex outdoor scenes from sparse input views. The key idea is to learn an image-conditional triplanar representation that combines both voxel-based and bird's eye view representations to efficiently encode information extracted from input images. This allows learning from many scenes to build strong priors while remaining able to generalize to novel scenes from as little as a single view. The method is evaluated on a new large-scale 360-degree outdoor dataset called NeRDS 360, comprising over 70 scenes. Experiments demonstrate superior performance to previous state-of-the-art methods, with the capability to perform plausible novel view synthesis including editing and scene decomposition from very limited observations of new environments, thanks to the learned strong priors. The representation also enables computational benefits compared to full 3D convolutions or voxel grids.
