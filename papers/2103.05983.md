# [Reformulating HOI Detection as Adaptive Set Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05983)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel one-stage framework called AS-Net for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. The key idea is to reformulate HOI detection as an adaptive set prediction problem rather than predicting interactions based on detected human-object pairs (two-stage methods) or fixed locations (one-stage methods). Specifically, AS-Net extracts global image features using a CNN-transformer encoder backbone, then predicts a set of instance boxes and a separate set of interaction vectors in parallel branches. To enable adaptive feature aggregation, the interaction branch maps a set of learnable query embeddings to interaction predictions using a transformer decoder with multi-head co-attention. Each query can focus on the most relevant global features. The predictions are supervised by matching interaction ground truths to their closest predicted interaction based on both geometry and learned semantic embeddings. An instance-aware attention module passes extra cues from the instance branch to help the interaction prediction. Without any extra pose/language features, AS-Net achieves state-of-the-art results on HICO-DET, V-COCO, and HOI-A, demonstrating the benefits of reformulating HOI detection as an adaptive set prediction problem solved with parallel detection branches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel one-stage HOI detection framework called AS-Net that reformulates HOI detection as an adaptive set prediction problem, breaking limitations of prior work by adaptively aggregating features and supervisions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It reformulates HOI detection as an adaptive set prediction problem, which breaks the limitations of previous instance-centric and location-dependent methods. This allows the model to adaptively concentrate on the most suitable features for each prediction.

2) It proposes a novel one-stage transformer-based HOI detection framework called AS-Net, with parallel instance and interaction branches. It also designs an instance-aware attention module to introduce informative instance features into the interaction branch.

3) Without extra features like human pose or language, the proposed AS-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three HOI detection benchmarks. Specifically, it achieves over 31% relative improvement on the large-scale HICO-DET dataset compared to the best existing one-stage method.

In summary, the key contribution is reformulating HOI detection to enable more adaptive feature aggregation and supervision, along with designing a new high-performing one-stage detection framework AS-Net. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.
