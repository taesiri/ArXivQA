# [Medical Image Retrieval Using Pretrained Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13547)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates the feasibility of using state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised pretrained models for content-based 3D medical image retrieval. Without any additional training or fine-tuning, the authors benchmark four models - DINOv1, DINOv2, DreamSim (self-supervised), and a Swin Transformer (supervised) - on a dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge. Retrieval is assessed at the modality, body region, and organ levels using two vector database indexing approaches. Since the models take 2D images as input, different slice aggregation methods are proposed to incorporate 3D volume information, including weighted slices and spatial subsampling schemes. The results demonstrate perfect recall at the modality level and high performance for several body regions across models, with DINOv1 achieving the best overall organ-level retrieval. The work shows pretrained embeddings can effectively enable medical image retrieval, and the count-based aggregation method leverages redundancy while reducing computation. Further analysis on multi-label slices and segmentation masks is suggested to improve organ-level accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates the feasibility of using four state-of-the-art pretrained models, including self-supervised and supervised models, for content-based 3D medical image retrieval at the modality, body region, and organ levels, comparing two similarity indexing approaches and analyzing the impact of weighting and sampling strategies to aggregate 2D slice information for retrieval of 3D volumes.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates the feasibility of using four state-of-the-art pretrained models - the self-supervised models DINOv1, DINOv2, and DreamSim trained on natural images, and the supervised model Swin Transformer trained on medical images - for content-based 3D medical image retrieval at the modality, body region, and organ levels. Different vector database indexing approaches and strategies to aggregate 2D slice information for 3D volumes are compared. The models achieve perfect recall on the modality and multiple body region tasks without any retraining or fine-tuning. The best performance uses DINOv1 features with LSH indexing and a count-based slice aggregation scheme, obtaining recall of 1.0 for several tasks. The results demonstrate medical image retrieval is feasible using models pretrained on both natural and medical images, and spatial redundancy can be leveraged to search 3D volumes via 2D slices.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates the feasibility of using state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised pretrained models for content-based 3D medical image retrieval at the modality, body region, and organ levels without any model retraining or fine-tuning, and shows high performance can be achieved by aggregating 2D slice similarities to the 3D volume level using different sampling and weighting strategies.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:

What is the feasibility and performance of utilizing pretrained embeddings, originally trained for non-CBIR (content-based image retrieval) tasks, for medical image retrieval?

Specifically, the paper evaluates the use of state-of-the-art self-supervised pretrained models (DINOv1, DINOv2, DreamSim) and supervised pretrained models (Swin Transformer, ResNet50) for medical image retrieval at the modality, body region, and organ levels. It compares different vector database indexing approaches (LSH and HNSW) and analyzes the impact of different slice weighting and sampling strategies when aggregating 2D slice information to retrieve 3D volumes. The goal is to assess the potential of using pretrained networks without any additional training or fine-tuning for medical image retrieval tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

1) Evaluating the performance of using state-of-the-art self-supervised pretrained models (DINOv1, DINOv2, DreamSim) versus a supervised pretrained model (Swin Transformer + ResNet50 trained on RadImageNet dataset) for 3D medical image retrieval tasks at the modality, body region, and organ levels.

2) Comparing two different vector database indexing approaches (LSH and HNSW) for medical image retrieval in combination with the different embedding types. 

3) Proposing and evaluating a simple but effective count-based scheme to aggregate 2D slice-level similarity information across 3D volumes, along with comparing different weighting and sub-sampling techniques.

So in summary, the main contribution is benchmarking various pretrained models and techniques for the task of content-based 3D medical image retrieval.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper compares several state-of-the-art pretrained models for medical image retrieval. Specifically:

- It benchmarks four different pretrained models: DINOv1, DINOv2, DreamSim (all self-supervised models trained on natural images) and a Swin Transformer + ResNet50 model trained on the RadImageNet medical imaging dataset.

- It evaluates these models on a medical image retrieval task using the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset, looking at performance for retrieving images by modality, body region and organ.

- It compares two different vector database indexing approaches for efficient similarity search - Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW).

- It proposes and evaluates different strategies for aggregating 2D slice information across 3D volumes to enable retrieval of full 3D medical images using the 2D pretrained models. This includes weighted slices and different sampling techniques.

Compared to other work:

- Very little prior work has assessed pretrained embeddings for medical image retrieval tasks specifically. This paper helps benchmark the potential of modern self-supervised models.

- It provides one of the first evaluations of methods like DINO, DreamSim for medical images.

- It compares against supervised pretraining on RadImageNet, to contrast with self-supervised models.

- It thoroughly evaluates different slice aggregation methods to handle 3D volumes, going beyond just using pretrained features.

So in summary, this paper provides a comprehensive benchmark of using modern pretrained models for medical CBIR across various axes - model type, indexing, aggregation - that has not been done thoroughly before.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1) Use more precise slice labels derived from segmentation masks instead of the current MSD challenge labels where only single organs are labeled per volume. This could help compensate for cases where multiple organs are visible in the images, especially in the abdomen region. 

2) Employ multiple labels per slice to account for the issue that often multiple organs are visible in the medical images even within a single slice. This could improve the organ-level performance analysis.

3) Investigate simple heuristic rules, e.g. slice rejection based on intensity values or anatomical location, to further improve the retrieval performance for specific organs.

4) Further compare models trained on domain-specific medical images versus self-supervised models trained on natural images to better understand if medical pretraining provides an advantage. The current study was limited in fully concluding which approach is better.

In summary, the main future work is to improve the labeling to better reflect cases with multiple organs per image, employ techniques like heuristic rules to enhance retrieval, and continue investigating transferability of different model types to medical images.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares self-supervised and supervised pretraining approaches. Could you expand more on the key differences between these approaches and why self-supervised pretraining performs well despite not having explicit labels during pretraining?

2. Various slice sampling and aggregation techniques are proposed to extend the 2D embeddings to 3D volumes. Could you discuss more on how you decided on these techniques and if any other alternatives were explored? 

3. The count-based aggregation scheme for combining 2D slice information seems simple yet effective. What is the intuition behind this approach working well compared to more complex aggregation methods?

4. Gaussian weighting is used to give more importance to center slices compared to outer slices. How sensitive is the performance to the exact parameters of the Gaussian distribution used? Was any parameter tuning performed?

5. The paper shows perfect recall for various tasks using pretrained embeddings without finetuning. Do you think finetuning would lead to further improvements or is the pretraining sufficient?

6. How do the computational requirements of extracting embeddings compare between the different pretrained models benchmarked in the paper?

7. The Abdomen region seems to be the most challenging in terms of disambiguating between overlapping organs. What techniques could help improve performance in this area?  

8. For clinical applications, precision can be as important as recall. Was precision analyzed in detail and what tradeoffs exist between optimizing for one vs the other?

9. The embeddings are extracted from 2D slices. Do you foresee challenges in extending this approach to natively 3D input data?

10. The method seems promising for medical image retrieval. What additional experimentation or validation is needed before considering real-world deployment?
