# [Entry-Specific Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion under Highly   Non-Uniform Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00184)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the matrix completion problem, where the goal is to estimate the unobserved entries of a low-rank matrix given a subset of noisy observations. Prior works focus on settings with uniform sampling probabilities across entries. This paper considers non-uniform sampling and aims to obtain estimation error bounds that are fine-grained for each individual entry, capturing the intuition that some entries can be better estimated than others under non-uniformity.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a meta-algorithm called "submatrix completion". For each entry (i,j) to be estimated, it selects a submatrix containing (i,j) by optimizing an upper bound on the eventual error. This submatrix is then fed into any matrix estimation method, with Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) used as a concrete example.  

The choice of submatrix balances two competing factors: 
1) larger submatrices allow for more observations but have smaller minimum sampling probabilities 
2) smaller submatrices have larger minimum probabilities but fewer observations. 

By choosing the submatrix in an entry-specific way, the algorithm obtains error bounds for each entry that depend on the localized sampling probabilities around that entry, instead of the smallest probability in the entire matrix.

Main Contributions:

1) Derives entry-specific error bounds for submatrix completion that can correctly distinguish the relative hardness of estimating different entries under non-uniform sampling.

2) Shows for certain structured sampling probabilities, the error bounds match information-theoretic minimax lower bounds, proving the optimality of the algorithm.  

3) Demonstrates through experiments that submatrix completion outperforms applying SVT naively on the entire matrix, with higher relative improvements for entries in regions with higher sampling rates.

4) Provides tools to adapt existing matrix completion analysis to settings with non-uniform observations and matrices containing entries with very small sampling probabilities.

In summary, the paper provides an intuitive algorithm along with tight entry-specific performance guarantees that capture the benefits of localized sampling probabilities for non-uniform matrix completion.
