# [Towards Robust Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04163v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How can we develop active feature acquisition (AFA) models that are more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and can scale to problems with a large number of candidate features?The key points are:- Current AFA models have difficulty scaling to problems with a large feature space. They also do not handle OOD inputs well - they may acquire arbitrary features for OOD data and make unreliable predictions. - The authors propose techniques to make AFA models more robust and scalable:  - A hierarchical policy to handle large feature spaces by clustering similar features.  - A method to detect OOD inputs from partially observed data during acquisition.  - Guiding the agent to acquire features useful for OOD detection.- Experiments show their framework scales to high dimensional problems, achieves state-of-the-art AFA performance, and is more robust to OOD data compared to prior methods.In summary, the main research question is how to improve AFA models to work with many candidate features and handle OOD inputs better, which the authors address through novel hierarchical acquisition, partial OOD detection, and incorporating OOD detection rewards.
