# Prompting Large Language Models with Answer Heuristics for
  Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we better activate the knowledge reasoning capacity of large language models like GPT-3 for the task of knowledge-based visual question answering?The paper proposes a method called Prophet that aims to address this question. The key ideas are:1. Current methods that use GPT-3 for knowledge-based VQA do not provide sufficient input information and context to fully exploit GPT-3's capabilities. 2. Providing GPT-3 with additional "answer heuristics" in the form of promising answer candidates and examples with similar answers can enhance its ability to reason about the required knowledge.3. These answer heuristics can be obtained from a task-specific VQA model trained on the dataset, without needing extra annotations.4. By prompting GPT-3 with these answer heuristics encoded into the prompt, its knowledge reasoning capacity for VQA can be significantly improved.In summary, the central hypothesis is that providing GPT-3 with richer and more task-specific information in the form of answer heuristics allows it to better adapt to knowledge-based VQA and produce more accurate answers by reasoning over its implicit knowledge. The Prophet framework is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting Prophet, a framework to prompt large language models like GPT-3 with answer heuristics for knowledge-based visual question answering. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Introducing a novel paradigm to prompt GPT-3 with two types of answer heuristics - answer candidates and answer-aware examples - to better activate its few-shot learning capacity.- The answer heuristics are generated from a task-specific VQA model trained on the dataset, which provides complementary information beyond just the image caption and question. - Without bells and whistles, Prophet significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets - OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.- Prophet achieves strong performance with limited resources - a single GPU and an affordable number of GPT-3 queries, making it easy to reproduce.In summary, the key contribution is presenting an effective and efficient framework to enhance large language models for knowledge-based VQA through heuristics-enhanced prompting. The results demonstrate the potential of properly instructing large LMs to perform knowledge reasoning for VQA tasks.
