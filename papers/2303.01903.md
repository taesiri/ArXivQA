# Prompting Large Language Models with Answer Heuristics for   Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we better activate the knowledge reasoning capacity of large language models like GPT-3 for the task of knowledge-based visual question answering?The paper proposes a method called Prophet that aims to address this question. The key ideas are:1. Current methods that use GPT-3 for knowledge-based VQA do not provide sufficient input information and context to fully exploit GPT-3's capabilities. 2. Providing GPT-3 with additional "answer heuristics" in the form of promising answer candidates and examples with similar answers can enhance its ability to reason about the required knowledge.3. These answer heuristics can be obtained from a task-specific VQA model trained on the dataset, without needing extra annotations.4. By prompting GPT-3 with these answer heuristics encoded into the prompt, its knowledge reasoning capacity for VQA can be significantly improved.In summary, the central hypothesis is that providing GPT-3 with richer and more task-specific information in the form of answer heuristics allows it to better adapt to knowledge-based VQA and produce more accurate answers by reasoning over its implicit knowledge. The Prophet framework is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting Prophet, a framework to prompt large language models like GPT-3 with answer heuristics for knowledge-based visual question answering. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Introducing a novel paradigm to prompt GPT-3 with two types of answer heuristics - answer candidates and answer-aware examples - to better activate its few-shot learning capacity.- The answer heuristics are generated from a task-specific VQA model trained on the dataset, which provides complementary information beyond just the image caption and question. - Without bells and whistles, Prophet significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets - OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.- Prophet achieves strong performance with limited resources - a single GPU and an affordable number of GPT-3 queries, making it easy to reproduce.In summary, the key contribution is presenting an effective and efficient framework to enhance large language models for knowledge-based VQA through heuristics-enhanced prompting. The results demonstrate the potential of properly instructing large LMs to perform knowledge reasoning for VQA tasks.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Prophet, a simple framework that enhances large language models like GPT-3 for knowledge-based visual question answering by prompting them with answer heuristics generated from a task-specific vision-language model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA):- The paper presents a new framework called Prophet that uses GPT-3 as the knowledge engine for VQA. This continues a recent trend of leveraging large language models like GPT-3 as implicit knowledge sources, rather than relying only on explicit knowledge bases. Other recent papers like PICa, KAT, and REVIVE have taken similar approaches.- A key contribution of this paper is introducing the idea of "prompting" GPT-3 with answer heuristics (candidates and examples) to better activate its capacity. Previous methods like PICa feed more limited information to GPT-3. The prompting strategy seems quite effective at improving performance.- In terms of results, Prophet outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets. The accuracy improvements are quite substantial compared to previous best methods like KAT, REVIVE, and even the heavily engineered Flamingo model.- The authors emphasize that Prophet has high reproducibility compared to models like Flamingo-80B, since it can be implemented on a single GPU with a feasible amount of GPT-3 queries. This could make it more accessible and practical for future research.- One limitation is that Prophet still relies on an expensive proprietary model, GPT-3, which may restrict broader adoption. But the prompting paradigm seems promising and could be applied to other emerging large language models.Overall, Prophet pushes state-of-the-art on knowledge-based VQA forward notably through its prompting approach to effectively exploit GPT-3. The simplicity and strong results relative to prior art make this a valuable contribution to the field.
