# Prompting Large Language Models with Answer Heuristics for
  Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we better activate the knowledge reasoning capacity of large language models like GPT-3 for the task of knowledge-based visual question answering?The paper proposes a method called Prophet that aims to address this question. The key ideas are:1. Current methods that use GPT-3 for knowledge-based VQA do not provide sufficient input information and context to fully exploit GPT-3's capabilities. 2. Providing GPT-3 with additional "answer heuristics" in the form of promising answer candidates and examples with similar answers can enhance its ability to reason about the required knowledge.3. These answer heuristics can be obtained from a task-specific VQA model trained on the dataset, without needing extra annotations.4. By prompting GPT-3 with these answer heuristics encoded into the prompt, its knowledge reasoning capacity for VQA can be significantly improved.In summary, the central hypothesis is that providing GPT-3 with richer and more task-specific information in the form of answer heuristics allows it to better adapt to knowledge-based VQA and produce more accurate answers by reasoning over its implicit knowledge. The Prophet framework is proposed to test this hypothesis.
