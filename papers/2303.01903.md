# [Prompting Large Language Models with Answer Heuristics for
  Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01903)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we better activate the knowledge reasoning capacity of large language models like GPT-3 for the task of knowledge-based visual question answering?

The paper proposes a method called Prophet that aims to address this question. The key ideas are:

1. Current methods that use GPT-3 for knowledge-based VQA do not provide sufficient input information and context to fully exploit GPT-3's capabilities. 

2. Providing GPT-3 with additional "answer heuristics" in the form of promising answer candidates and examples with similar answers can enhance its ability to reason about the required knowledge.

3. These answer heuristics can be obtained from a task-specific VQA model trained on the dataset, without needing extra annotations.

4. By prompting GPT-3 with these answer heuristics encoded into the prompt, its knowledge reasoning capacity for VQA can be significantly improved.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that providing GPT-3 with richer and more task-specific information in the form of answer heuristics allows it to better adapt to knowledge-based VQA and produce more accurate answers by reasoning over its implicit knowledge. The Prophet framework is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting Prophet, a framework to prompt large language models like GPT-3 with answer heuristics for knowledge-based visual question answering. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Introducing a novel paradigm to prompt GPT-3 with two types of answer heuristics - answer candidates and answer-aware examples - to better activate its few-shot learning capacity.

- The answer heuristics are generated from a task-specific VQA model trained on the dataset, which provides complementary information beyond just the image caption and question. 

- Without bells and whistles, Prophet significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets - OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.

- Prophet achieves strong performance with limited resources - a single GPU and an affordable number of GPT-3 queries, making it easy to reproduce.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an effective and efficient framework to enhance large language models for knowledge-based VQA through heuristics-enhanced prompting. The results demonstrate the potential of properly instructing large LMs to perform knowledge reasoning for VQA tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA):

- The paper presents a new framework called Prophet that uses GPT-3 as the knowledge engine for VQA. This continues a recent trend of leveraging large language models like GPT-3 as implicit knowledge sources, rather than relying only on explicit knowledge bases. Other recent papers like PICa, KAT, and REVIVE have taken similar approaches.

- A key contribution of this paper is introducing the idea of "prompting" GPT-3 with answer heuristics (candidates and examples) to better activate its capacity. Previous methods like PICa feed more limited information to GPT-3. The prompting strategy seems quite effective at improving performance.

- In terms of results, Prophet outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets. The accuracy improvements are quite substantial compared to previous best methods like KAT, REVIVE, and even the heavily engineered Flamingo model.

- The authors emphasize that Prophet has high reproducibility compared to models like Flamingo-80B, since it can be implemented on a single GPU with a feasible amount of GPT-3 queries. This could make it more accessible and practical for future research.

- One limitation is that Prophet still relies on an expensive proprietary model, GPT-3, which may restrict broader adoption. But the prompting paradigm seems promising and could be applied to other emerging large language models.

Overall, Prophet pushes state-of-the-art on knowledge-based VQA forward notably through its prompting approach to effectively exploit GPT-3. The simplicity and strong results relative to prior art make this a valuable contribution to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving visual understanding in knowledge-based VQA models. The authors note that insufficient visual understanding was a major cause of errors in their Prophet model. They suggest developing more powerful VQA models with better visual reasoning capabilities.

- Advancing knowledge acquisition and reasoning in LLMs. The authors found that incorrect knowledge reasoning was the biggest failure cause of their model. They suggest exploring methods to expand the knowledge capacity and reasoning ability of large language models like GPT-3.

- Developing more accurate answer heuristics. The authors propose generating better quality answer candidates and examples to provide GPT-3 with more useful heuristics. This could involve designing better prompt formats or training the VQA model to produce more accurate predictions.

- Adapting the framework to other VQA tasks. The authors suggest adapting Prophet to other VQA settings beyond open-domain knowledge VQA, such as multiple choice VQA.

- Reducing computational overhead. The authors note the high computational costs required to train large VQA models and query LLMs. They suggest exploring ways to develop more efficientPrompt: Based on the paper I summarized, what future research directions do the authors suggest?

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Prophet, a framework for prompting the large language model GPT-3 with answer heuristics to enhance its reasoning and prediction abilities for knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA). Prophet has two stages - generating answer heuristics from a vanilla VQA model, and prompting GPT-3 with these heuristics. In the first stage, the vanilla VQA model trained on a VQA dataset produces two types of complementary answer heuristics - answer candidates (promising answers with scores) and answer-aware examples (examples with similar answers to the input). In the second stage, these heuristics are encoded into prompts to provide GPT-3 with richer, more task-specific information to better adapt it to the VQA task and enhance its prediction capacity. Without any bells and whistles, Prophet significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets - OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. The results show the effectiveness of prompting GPT-3 with learned heuristics, and the advantage of Prophet's simple yet powerful prompting paradigm to exploit the knowledge and reasoning abilities of large language models for knowledge-based VQA.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Prophet, a framework for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 with answer heuristics to improve performance on knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). Prophet has two main stages: answer heuristics generation and heuristics-enhanced prompting. In the first stage, Prophet trains a vanilla VQA model on a knowledge-based VQA dataset without external knowledge. This model generates two types of complementary answer heuristics: answer candidates (likely answers with confidence scores) and answer-aware examples (training examples with similar answers to the test input). In the second stage, these heuristics are encoded into prompts to provide GPT-3 with additional task-specific information and enhance its reasoning capacity. 

Prophet was evaluated on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets - OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. It significantly outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods, including retrieval-based methods using knowledge bases, multimodal pretraining methods like Unified-IO, and methods prompting GPT-3 like PICa. Prophet achieved 61.1% and 55.7% accuracy on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA test sets, showing the benefits of prompting GPT-3 with task-specific answer heuristics. The paper demonstrates how providing LLMs with the right prompts and examples can better activate their reasoning and few-shot learning abilities.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents Prophet, a framework that prompts the large language model GPT-3 with answer heuristics for knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA). Prophet has two stages - answer heuristics generation and heuristics-enhanced prompting. In the first stage, a vanilla VQA model is trained on a knowledge-based VQA dataset to generate two types of complementary answer heuristics: answer candidates (promising answers with confidence scores) and answer-aware examples (examples with similar answers to the input).

The answer candidates provide promising answers while the answer-aware examples help GPT-3 adapt to the task through its few-shot learning ability. By prompting GPT-3 with these heuristics, Prophet is able to significantly outperform previous methods that directly feed the image, caption, and question into GPT-3. The core idea is to activate GPT-3's capacity by prompting it with learned answer heuristics tailored for the knowledge-based VQA task.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the key problem this paper is addressing is:

How to better leverage large language models like GPT-3 for knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA). 

The paper argues that previous methods using GPT-3 for knowledge-based VQA have not fully activated the capacity of GPT-3, because the input prompt does not provide sufficient information. 

To address this, the paper proposes "Prophet" - a framework to provide GPT-3 with better prompts containing "answer heuristics". These heuristics include answer candidates and answer-aware examples, which are generated from a separately trained VQA model. 

By prompting GPT-3 with these heuristics, the paper shows Prophet can significantly improve performance on knowledge-based VQA datasets like OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key problem is how to design better prompts to fully exploit the knowledge reasoning capacity of large language models like GPT-3 for knowledge-based VQA. The paper proposes answer heuristics to enhance the prompts and achieve new state-of-the-art results.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and ideas include:

- Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA): The paper focuses on VQA tasks that require reasoning about external knowledge beyond just the image content.

- Large language models (LLMs): The method uses a large pre-trained language model like GPT-3 as an implicit knowledge source. 

- Prompting with answer heuristics: The main idea is to prompt the LLM with promising candidate answers and supporting examples to better activate its knowledge reasoning capacity.

- Answer candidates: A list of likely answers for a given image-question pair, scored by confidence. Helps focus the LLM.

- Answer-aware examples: Training examples that have similar ground truth answers to the test input. Helps provide useful context.

- Decoupled learning: Separately trains a task-specific VQA model and uses a generic pre-trained LLM. More efficient than end-to-end approaches.

- Enhanced prompting: Carefully formats the input prompt with answer heuristics to better instruct the LLM on the task.

- State-of-the-art results: Outperforms prior methods on challenging VQA datasets like OK-VQA and A-OKVQA without expensive training.

In summary, the key focus is on more effectively prompting large language models for knowledge-based VQA using answer heuristics from a separately trained VQA model. The heuristics-enhanced prompting achieves new state-of-the-art results efficiently.
