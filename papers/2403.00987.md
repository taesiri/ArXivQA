## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Controlling teams of robotic manipulators with uncertain, heterogeneous dynamics is challenging, especially in unpredictable environments like space or underwater.  
- Existing methods make simplifying assumptions about the robots' dynamics which limits their applicability. They also focus solely on control without learning the dynamics.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-layer distributed control framework for multi-robot synchronization and learning under completely uncertain nonlinear dynamics.
- First layer: Distributed cooperative estimator allows each robot to estimate the leader's states through local communication. 
- Second layer: Decentralized adaptive controller enables tracking of leader's trajectory and learning of local robot's dynamics using radial basis function neural networks, without any inter-robot communication.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves both synchronization control and learning of complete nonlinear uncertain dynamics in a fully decentralized manner, with no assumptions on the robots' dynamics.
- Controller is environment-independent, allowing application in unpredictable environments like space and underwater.  
- Learned dynamics can be stored and reused after system restart, eliminating repeated adaptation.
- Rigorous mathematical stability analysis provided for parameter convergence and system performance.
- Effectiveness demonstrated through simulations on team of heterogeneous robotic manipulators.

In summary, the key novelty is introducing a distributed two-layer approach for multi-robot control and learning under complete dynamic uncertainty, with proven stability and without any limiting assumptions. This allows decentralized, adaptive control and dynamics learning for robots operating in unpredictable environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a two-layer distributed adaptive learning control framework to achieve synchronization and identify completely uncertain nonlinear dynamics in a leader-follower multi-robot network, using a cooperative estimator in the first layer and a decentralized deterministic learning controller in the second layer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel two-layer distributed adaptive learning control strategy for the challenging problem of achieving synchronization and learning complete nonlinear uncertain dynamics of heterogeneous multi-robot manipulator systems. Specifically:

1) The first layer introduces a distributed cooperative estimator to facilitate each robot's estimation of the leader's information through local communication. 

2) The second layer puts forth a decentralized deterministic learning controller that enables each robot to track desired trajectories and accurately identify/learn its own completely nonlinear uncertain dynamics using radial basis function neural networks. 

3) Compared to existing literature, this framework stands out due to its ability to handle robotic agents with fully uncertain dynamics, without needing any knowledge or assumptions about the system parameters like mass or inertia matrices. This allows the control strategy to be environment-independent.

4) The proposed approach is rigorously shown to ensure stability and parameter convergence. Extensive simulations validate its effectiveness for multi-robot manipulator systems with heterogeneous nonlinear uncertainties.

In summary, the key novelty lies in enabling both synchronization control and learning of complete system nonlinearities in a fully decentralized manner for networked Euler-Lagrange robots with unstructured heterogeneous uncertainties.
