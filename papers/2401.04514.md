# [Rewriting the Code: A Simple Method for Large Language Model Augmented   Code Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04514)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Code search aims to retrieve relevant code snippets from a codebase based on a natural language query. However, there is a vocabulary mismatch between queries and code snippets due to the differences in programming languages and natural languages.
- Existing methods like sparse retrieval suffer from limited word overlap while dense retrieval may fail to capture rare co-occurrences between queries and codes. 
- The Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework uses large language models (LLMs) to generate exemplar codes from the query to augment retrieval. But GAR shows limited gains in code search as the generated codes can differ stylistically from the ground truth codes.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ReCo, an extension of GAR, which additionally rewrites the codes in the codebase to normalize their style. 
- ReCo first uses LLMs to generate exemplar codes from the query. Then it summarizes each code snippet into a description and generates rewritten codes from those descriptions.
- The rewritten codes align more closely in style with the exemplar codes. Augmenting retrieval with both allows better capturing semantic relevance.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes ReCo method to rewrite codebase and normalize code style for improved code search with GAR
- ReCo gives significant gains over GAR across models like BM25, CodeBERT, UniXcoder etc. and datasets in multiple languages
- Introduces Code Style Similarity metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarity of code snippets 
- Empirical analysis shows existing metrics fail to capture stylistic nuances while proposed metric correlates well with ReCo's gains
- Findings validate that reducing style deviation between generated and ground truth code boosts retrieval accuracy


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called ReCo that rewrites code snippets in a codebase to normalize their style with exemplar code snippets generated by large language models, in order to improve code search through the generation-augmented retrieval framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method called ReCo (Rewriting the Code) to improve code search using large language models (LLMs). The key contributions are:

1) ReCo extends the existing Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework for code search by additionally rewriting the codes in the codebase to normalize their style with the exemplar codes generated by LLMs. This helps address the style mismatch issue between generated and ground truth codes.

2) Experiments across diverse code search models and datasets demonstrate that ReCo boosts retrieval accuracy substantially (up to 35.7% for sparse retrieval and 27.6% for dense retrieval) compared to simply using GAR.

3) The paper introduces a new metric called Code Style Similarity to quantify stylistic similarity between two code snippets. This is the first such metric designed specifically for measuring code style. Experiments show it better explains the performance improvement from ReCo compared to existing semantic similarity metrics.

4) Analysis provides theoretical insights into why aligning the styles of generated and original codes leads to better retrieval performance in ReCo.

In summary, the key contribution is a new LLM-based code normalization method ReCo that significantly improves code search accuracy by rewriting codebase to match styles of generated exemplars. Both empirical and theoretical analysis back the advantages of ReCo.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Code search - Retrieving relevant code snippets from a codebase based on a natural language query. The main task that the paper aims to improve.

- Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) - A framework that generates exemplar codes based on the query to augment it before retrieving relevant code snippets. The paper builds on this method.

- ReCo - The proposed method in the paper that additionally rewrites the codes in the codebase to normalize their style and match the style of the exemplar codes. 

- Code style normalization - The process of rewriting code snippets to conform to a standardized style. A key contribution and motivation of the ReCo method. 

- Large language models (LLMs) - Powerful neural network models like GPT-3 that are used to generate the exemplar and rewritten codes in ReCo.

- Code Style Similarity - A novel metric proposed to quantify stylistic similarity between code snippets. Used to evaluate and explain the effects of ReCo.

- Sparse/dense retrieval - Different retrieval paradigms used for code search. ReCo is evaluated on both sparse (keyword-based) and dense (semantic matching) retrieval systems.

So in summary, the key novel terms and concepts focus on using LLMs to rewrite/normalize code, improving code search through style matching, and introducing a way to measure code style similarity.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that the key motivation behind ReCo is to normalize the code style between the exemplar code generated by the LLM and the original code in the codebase. Why is this normalization of code style important for improving code search performance?

2. The ReCo method relies on first summarizing the original code snippet into a natural language description and then generating a rewritten version of the code based on that description. What is the rationale behind this summarize-then-generate approach compared to directly prompting the LLM to rewrite the original code? 

3. The paper introduces a new metric called Code Style Similarity (CSSim) to quantitatively measure stylistic similarity between code snippets. What are the key limitations of existing metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L and CodeBLEU that CSSim aims to address?

4. What are the three distinct perspectives from which CSSim evaluates code style similarity? Explain each of them and how edit distance is used to calculate the style distance.  

5. The experiments show that larger LLMs like GPT-3.5 yield greater improvements in code search when using ReCo compared to smaller models like Code Llama. What factors contribute to this correlation between LLM scale and ReCo performance?

6. How does ReCo theoretically make the distribution of exemplar codes and rewritten codes more similar compared to just using exemplar code generation in GAR? Explain the probabilistic argument outlined in the paper.

7. What practical trade-offs need to be considered in determining the number of exemplar codes to generate and number of times to rewrite each code snippet when implementing ReCo? 

8. The paper argues that ReCo can benefit not only supervised models but also unsupervised methods like BM25 and Contriever. Why is a code style normalization approach like ReCo broadly applicable?

9. What steps could be taken to further improve the efficiency of ReCo while retaining its benefits? Is there scope for developing specialized models just for code style normalization?

10. How do you see code style normalization research progressing in the future? What promising directions are opened up by proposing metrics like CSSim explicitly targeted at style similarity?
