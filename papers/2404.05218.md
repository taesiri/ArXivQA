# [Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware   Trajectory Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing human pose forecasting methods have limitations in handling long-term forecasts (>3s) for multiple agents (>5) due to the complexity of modeling multi-modal motion and intricate inter-agent interactions.
- Current datasets also lack long-term, multi-agent examples needed to develop and evaluate models for such complex forecasting. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an interaction-aware, trajectory-conditioned model for long-term multi-agent pose forecasting. 
- The model uses a coarse-to-fine approach by first forecasting multi-modal global trajectory proposals and then generating pose forecasts conditioned on each trajectory mode.
- It introduces a Traj-Pose module for interaction modeling between global trajectories and local poses.
- The paper also constructs a new real-world dataset called JRDB-GlobMultiPose with up to 24 agents over 5s using 3D pose extraction and refinement.

Main Contributions:
- Interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned pose forecasting model (T2P) to handle complexity of long-term multi-agent forecasting
- Traj-Pose module to enable efficient, reciprocal conditioning of trajectories and poses
- JRDB-GlobMultiPose dataset with unprecedented length and agent counts in real-world settings
- State-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets demonstrating generalized effectiveness for complex scenes

In summary, the paper tackles limitations in existing work for long-term, multi-agent pose forecasting through both modeling and data contributions. The interaction-aware, coarse-to-fine T2P model outperforms previous state-of-the-art on multiple benchmark datasets as well as the newly proposed real-world dataset.
