# [VideoBERT: A Joint Model for Video and Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01766)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn high-level video representations that capture semantically meaningful and temporally long-range structure in a self-supervised manner, by leveraging both visual and linguistic modalities?The key hypothesis seems to be that by adapting the BERT language model to jointly learn distributions over sequences of visual and linguistic tokens derived from video, the model can discover useful high-level semantic features for video understanding tasks, without needing manual labels.In particular, the paper proposes VideoBERT, which extends BERT to model joint distributions over visual and linguistic sequences. The visual sequences are obtained via vector quantization of pretrained video features, while linguistic sequences come from ASR transcripts. VideoBERT is pretrained on a large dataset of instructional cooking videos from YouTube using masked token prediction and linguistic-visual alignment objectives. The authors then demonstrate how VideoBERT can be applied to video classification and captioning in a zero-shot or transfer learning setting, showing it captures high-level semantics and outperforms prior work. The paper also analyzes benefits of large-scale pretraining data and cross-modal learning.In summary, the core research question is how to learn high-level video representations in a self-supervised cross-modal manner, which VideoBERT aims to address via an extension of the BERT language model to the video domain.
