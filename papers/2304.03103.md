# [Retention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03103)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goal of this paper is to develop an explainable AI (XAI) based decision support system called HR-DSS to analyze employee attrition and provide insights to help with retention policies. Specifically, the paper proposes using machine learning models like XGBoost to predict employee attrition, and then leveraging explainable AI techniques like SHAP to interpret the predictions and important features driving attrition. The SHAP values are further processed to generate natural language explanations that provide justifications for attrition predictions. The overall vision is to build an interactive decision support system with explainable AI that can assist HR personnel in understanding factors causing employee attrition at both an individual and company-wide level. This system can then help HR units make informed decisions about retention policies and strategies to reduce attrition.In summary, the key research goals are:- Develop machine learning models to predict employee attrition- Apply explainable AI techniques like SHAP to interpret predictions- Generate natural language explanations from SHAP values- Build an interactive decision support system with explainable AI to aid HR retention policies- Provide individual and company-wide insights on attrition factors to assist HR decision making


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- The proposal of an HR decision support system (HR-DSS) that uses explainable AI to provide insights into employee attrition. - Conducting experiments with 8 machine learning models on the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset and selecting XGB as the best performing model with 89.12% accuracy.- Employing the SHAP explainability method on the predictions of the XGB model to identify the key features contributing to employee attrition such as Overtime, StockOptionLevel and MonthlyIncome.- Integrating natural language generation using GPT-3 to generate explanations of the SHAP values in natural language that can be readily understood by HR personnel. - Developing an interactive explainer dashboard that allows HR to analyze the factors affecting attrition for individual employees and tweak parameters to see the effect on retention.- Demonstrating how adjusting dominant features of individual employees through "What-if analysis" in the dashboard can potentially turn attrition into retention.In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end XAI-driven decision support system called HR-DSS that can provide HR understandable and actionable insights into employee attrition at both the individual and global level to inform retention strategies. The integration of predictive modeling, explainability and an interactive interface makes this system useful for real-world application.
