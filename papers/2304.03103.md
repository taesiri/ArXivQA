# [Retention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03103)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goal of this paper is to develop an explainable AI (XAI) based decision support system called HR-DSS to analyze employee attrition and provide insights to help with retention policies. Specifically, the paper proposes using machine learning models like XGBoost to predict employee attrition, and then leveraging explainable AI techniques like SHAP to interpret the predictions and important features driving attrition. The SHAP values are further processed to generate natural language explanations that provide justifications for attrition predictions. The overall vision is to build an interactive decision support system with explainable AI that can assist HR personnel in understanding factors causing employee attrition at both an individual and company-wide level. This system can then help HR units make informed decisions about retention policies and strategies to reduce attrition.In summary, the key research goals are:- Develop machine learning models to predict employee attrition- Apply explainable AI techniques like SHAP to interpret predictions- Generate natural language explanations from SHAP values- Build an interactive decision support system with explainable AI to aid HR retention policies- Provide individual and company-wide insights on attrition factors to assist HR decision making
