# [Birbal: An efficient 7B instruct-model fine-tuned with curated datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are expensive to fine-tune and access due to hardware constraints, limiting widespread usage. 
- Lack of transparency around model training methods and data leads to poor reproducibility.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors participated in the LLM Efficiency Challenge introduced at a NeurIPS workshop. The goal was to adapt an open-source foundation model to diverse tasks with fine-tuning on a single GPU within 24 hours. 
- They developed "Birbal", based on the open-source 7B parameter Mistral model. The key was curating high-quality instruction datasets covering diverse tasks rather than optimizations.

Approach:
- Curated 200k, 400k and 700k instruction datasets from quality sources like LIMA, Open-Platypus and Natural Instructions.
- Fine-tuned Mistral-7B on this dataset with 4-bit QLoRA optimization for 16 hours on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
- Submitted 3 models for evaluation, with the 200k model (Birbal-200k) performing the best.

Results: 
- In closed eval on unseen tasks, Birbal-200k outperformed the next best model by 35%, showing the impact of data curation.
- It scored higher on more tasks compared to the base Mistral-7B model and Birbal fine-tuned with more data.
- The approach demonstrates how high quality instruction tuning rather than scale enables accessible and reproducible competitive LLMs.

In summary, the key novelty is leveraging compact, curated instruction tuning rather than scale for accessible yet strong language model fine-tuning within hardware constraints, enabling democratized access. The reproducibility and open access of the artifacts is also impactful.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The authors introduce Birbal, their winning model from the NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge, which is a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned on a curated dataset for 16 hours on a single RTX 4090 GPU that achieved 35% better performance over the second place model by focusing on high-quality instructions covering diverse tasks rather than hardware optimizations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The development and release of Birbal, an efficiently fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) based on the open-source Mistral-7B model. Specifically:

- Birbal won the NeurIPS 2022 LLM Efficiency Challenge by outperforming other submissions in the competition by over 35%. It was fine-tuned on a single Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU for 16 hours.

- The key to Birbal's strong performance was the curation of a high-quality dataset covering diverse tasks, assembled from existing open datasets. This included around 200k examples spanning question answering, sentiment analysis, program execution, toxic language detection and more.

- Birbal addresses the lack of transparency and reproducibility in LLM training. The authors have open-sourced the full model, training methodology, datasets used, and code to reproduce the results.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficiently fine-tuned, performant and transparent open-source LLM that helps democratize access to such models by showing they can be adapted on a single GPU within a reasonable timeframe.

The paper introduces Birbal, the winning model from the NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge. Birbal is a fine-tuned version of the open-source Mistral-7B model, adapted for efficient performance on a diverse set of tasks using a single GPU within a 24-hour timeframe. Key elements of Birbal's development highlighted in the paper include high-quality data curation across multiple datasets and tasks, a focus on instruction tuning, and the use of quantification techniques like QLoRA during fine-tuning. Reproducibility through open-sourcing the model, data, and methods is also emphasized. The strong performance of Birbal, a medium-sized 7B parameter model, relative to other submissions based on much larger models further demonstrates the efficacy of the data curation and tuning methodology.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions curating high-quality instructions covering diverse tasks as a key reason for Birbal's success. What were some of the strategies used for curating these instructions and selecting the tasks to cover? How was the quality and diversity assessed?

2. The paper discusses sampling more examples from lower accuracy tasks during data curation. What was the rationale behind this strategy? How did the team determine the optimal proportion of examples to sample from tasks of varying difficulties? 

3. One of the design choices was choosing between hardware optimization and high-quality data curation. What are some ways the training efficiency could have been improved through hardware-level optimizations? Why was this not pursued further?

4. The paper employed 4-bit QLoRA during fine-tuning to meet the time constraints. How does QLoRA work? What motivated its usage over regular full-precision training? What hyperparameter tuning was done for the QLoRA implementation?

5. The model training used gradient accumulation and sample packing for efficiency. Can you explain how these techniques work? What impact did they have on optimizing the fine-tuning process?

6. Three fine-tuned models were submitted using datasets of varying sizes. How did the performance tradeoffs change with more data? What could explain improved performance on closed tasks but drops on some open tasks with 700K examples?

7. The paper mentions biases that may be present in Birbal inherited from the base model and datasets. What steps were taken during data curation and fine-tuning to mitigate some of these biases to the extent possible?

8. One of the goals was adapting the foundation model on diverse tasks via fine-tuning. Other than curating a diverse dataset, what architectural modifications or multi-task learning approaches could have helped improve breadth of capabilities?

9. The winning model significantly outperformed the second place submission despite using a smaller base model. What aspects of the training methodology do you think were most vital for this boost in performance?

10. If provided more time and resources, how can the methodology be improved further? What other data sources could have been leveraged? Would an even larger and more diverse dataset have continued to improve performance?
