 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Attention-guided Feature Distillation for Semantic Segmentation":

Problem:
Semantic segmentation is an important computer vision task with applications like autonomous driving. Highly complex models like DeepLab v3+ with ResNet101 backbone achieve good accuracy but are computationally expensive. Knowledge distillation is used to transfer knowledge from such complex teacher models to lightweight student models to balance accuracy and efficiency. Existing distillation methods for segmentation use complex losses to capture contextual information. But these complex losses and feature extraction processes result in complex student models. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel yet simple attention-guided distillation method (AttnFD) that uses the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to refine intermediate feature maps from teacher and student models before distillation. CBAM performs channel and spatial attention to highlight important regions and reduce noise. These refined attention-guided features are then distilled to the student using just the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss without any complex losses.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a straightforward attention-based distillation method that leverages CBAM to refine features for transferring attention from teacher to student instead of designing complex losses.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance beating prior distillation methods by a significant margin on Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets. Gets 1.67% and 0.96% higher mIoU compared to prior best methods on the two datasets using ResNet18 student backbone.
- Ablation studies validate that distilling attention-guided features from different layers contributes to performance gain. Refined decoder features show more improvement indicating their richness.
- Qualitative results demonstrate reduced background noise and highlighted important regions in refined features supporting their efficacy in mimicking teacher's attention.
