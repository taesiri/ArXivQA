## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Geometric algebra (GA) provides a powerful mathematical framework for geometric computing and allows compact representation of geometric entities and transformations. However, its inherent complexity makes adoption challenging, especially among applied mathematicians and engineers. Existing GA software tools lack support for symbolic computations and are not tailored for practical applications. This hinders wider adoption of GA among professionals.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces SUGAR (Symbolic and User-Friendly Geometric Algebra Routines) - an open-source Matlab toolbox for symbolic and numerical computation with GA and conformal GA. SUGAR allows:

- Symbolic and numeric computation with GA, projective GA (PGA) and conformal GA (CGA) of any dimension/signature
- User-friendly functions aligned with established GA methodologies to lower learning curve 
- Efficient handling of multivector functions like exp, log, sin, cos - enhancing applicability across engineering domains
- Matrix computations extended to multivectors - allowing arrays and matrices of multivectors

Main Contributions:

- First GA toolbox in Matlab allowing symbolic computations, scaling to any dimension
- Carefully engineered for applied mathematics and engineering applications 
- Intuitive support for key GA entities and computations 
- Efficient implementation of non-trivial multivector functions
- Seamless matrix computations with multivectors
- Practical examples demonstrating use across robotics, rigid body dynamics, power electronics

The unique symbolic computation capabilities open possibilities to derive closed-form multivector formulas unaddressed in literature so far. Overall, SUGAR lowers barriers in adopting GA among professionals by resolutely focusing on user-friendliness without compromising efficient computation.
