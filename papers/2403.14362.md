# [Less but Better: Enabling Generalized Zero-shot Learning Towards Unseen   Domains by Intrinsic Learning from Redundant LLM Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14362)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper introduces a new cross-domain generalized zero-shot learning (CDGZSL) setting, which aims to recognize both seen and unseen classes from unseen domains during testing. This is more realistic than traditional ZSL settings but also more challenging.  

- Existing CDZSL methods fail in the CDGZSL setting due to the domain shift problem causing poor recognition of unseen classes. Generative methods can help but have difficulties mapping redundant semantics from large language models to dense features.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR) to refine semantics and mitigate information asymmetry between semantics and features.

- It first constructs a common feature space for seen domains using domain adversarial networks.  

- Then it refines semantics in two ways: 1) Inter-class Similarity Alignment removes non-intrinsic semantics using class relationships from the feature space. 2) Unseen-class Meta Generation preserves intrinsic semantics via meta-simulated feature generation.

- The refined compact semantics are used to generate reliable unseen features for final CDGZSL classification.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces CDGZSL setting and uncovers the bottleneck of information asymmetry caused by semantic redundancy.

- Designs MDASR framework to eliminate non-intrinsic semantics and preserve intrinsic semantics under feature space guidance.

- Validates state-of-the-art CDGZSL performance on Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet. Provides corresponding semantics as benchmark.

In summary, the paper pioneers the CDGZSL problem, reveals the redundancy issue with large language model semantics, and contributes an effective intrinsic semantic learning solution, outperforming prior arts on public datasets.
