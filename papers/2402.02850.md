# [An Attention Long Short-Term Memory based system for automatic   classification of speech intelligibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02850)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Speech intelligibility can get degraded due to various factors like background noise, technical issues, or biological conditions. Specifically, the paper focuses on the problem of automatically and non-intrusively predicting speech intelligibility levels (low, medium, high) for people with dysarthria, which is a motor speech disorder affecting the articulation of speech. Manually evaluating speech intelligibility levels through subjective listening tests by specialists is time-consuming and subjective. Hence, the paper aims to develop an automatic speech intelligibility classification system.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a system based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model the temporal characteristics of speech combined with an attention mechanism to determine the relevance of each temporal frame. The LSTM models use log-mel spectrograms as input features. Additionally, a reference support vector machine (SVM) system with hand-crafted acoustic features like modulation spectra, MFCCs etc. is implemented. 

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of LSTM networks for non-intrusive pathological speech intelligibility assessment, which has not been explored much previously.
- Incorporation of a simple attention mechanism in LSTM to weight the contribution of different frames.
- Experimental evaluation on UA-Speech dysarthric database showing LSTM with attention model achieves best accuracy of 76.97% outperforming SVM system (55.54% with Falk features) and basic LSTM model without attention (67.50%).
- Analysis revealing usefulness of hesitation/disfluencies in weighting by attention, and detrimental impact of removing silence frames via VAD.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of LSTMs and attention for pathological speech intelligibility classification, outperforming conventional feature-based SVM systems. The attention mechanism is able to capture relevant utterance frames.
