# [Weakly Supervised Segmentation of Vertebral Bodies with Iterative   Slice-propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Segmentation of vertebral bodies (VBs) from CT scans is important for diagnosis of spinal diseases, but most methods require expensive voxel-wise annotations. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a weakly supervised iterative spinal segmentation (WISS) method that only requires 4 corner point labels on a single sagittal slice.

- WISS first segments the VBs on the labeled slice using a self-training approach with Mask R-CNN. It alternates between training the model and refining the labels using confident prediction selection and conditional random fields.

- After the model converges on the labeled slice, WISS propagates the model to neighboring slices using the converged model predictions as labels. This is iterated across all slices to get full 3D volumetric segmentation.

Main Contributions:
- Requires only 4 corner point labels on one slice instead of full voxel-wise labels, greatly reducing annotation cost.

- Achieves 2.1-3.7% dice coefficient improvement compared to backbone networks U-Net and Mask R-CNN on a spinal metastasis dataset.

- Robust to weak supervision noise during training. 

- On a public lumbar CT dataset, achieves 91.7% dice on sagittal slices and 83.7% dice for full 3D segmentation. This is slightly lower than fully supervised methods but at major reduction in annotation cost.

In summary, the key innovation is using weak slice-level supervision to achieve full 3D vertebral body segmentation while greatly reducing annotation requirements. The method is robust and achieves good performance compared to full supervision approaches.
