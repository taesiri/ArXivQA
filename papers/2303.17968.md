# [VDN-NeRF: Resolving Shape-Radiance Ambiguity via View-Dependence   Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17968)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to better reconstruct 3D geometry under non-Lambertian surface conditions and dynamic lighting that cause significant variation in the radiance of a point when viewed from different angles? The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the complex factors resulting in view-dependent radiance is difficult and may not capture all variations. Instead, the paper proposes a method to normalize the view-dependence by distilling invariant features already learned by the NeRF model. This allows jointly training the NeRF for novel view synthesis while regularizing it with view-dependence normalization to attain high quality geometry reconstruction.In summary, the paper aims to resolve the shape-radiance ambiguity in NeRF training that leads to degraded geometry when there is significant view-dependent radiance variation. It does this by proposing a view-dependence normalization technique based on self-supervision from the NeRF model itself.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing VDN-NeRF, a method to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for better geometry reconstruction under non-Lambertian surface and dynamic lighting conditions. The key ideas are:- Analyzing the coupling between the capacity of the view-dependent radiance function and the shape-radiance ambiguity in NeRF optimization. A larger capacity can fit complex radiance variations but also permits degenerated geometry. - Proposing a view-dependence normalization method that aligns the minimality of the shape-radiance ambiguity for different scenes by self-distilling depth features into a neural feature field. This helps constrain the geometry while allowing enough capacity to model radiance variations.- Demonstrating that the proposed method can minimize the effect of shape-radiance ambiguity on geometry. It significantly improves geometry reconstruction on various datasets, especially on a new proposed dataset with dynamic lighting.In summary, this paper studies the inherent shape-radiance ambiguity issue in NeRFs, and proposes a simple yet effective view-dependence normalization technique to attain high-quality geometry without relying on external signals.
