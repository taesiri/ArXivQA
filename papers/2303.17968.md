# [VDN-NeRF: Resolving Shape-Radiance Ambiguity via View-Dependence   Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17968)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to better reconstruct 3D geometry under non-Lambertian surface conditions and dynamic lighting that cause significant variation in the radiance of a point when viewed from different angles? The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the complex factors resulting in view-dependent radiance is difficult and may not capture all variations. Instead, the paper proposes a method to normalize the view-dependence by distilling invariant features already learned by the NeRF model. This allows jointly training the NeRF for novel view synthesis while regularizing it with view-dependence normalization to attain high quality geometry reconstruction.In summary, the paper aims to resolve the shape-radiance ambiguity in NeRF training that leads to degraded geometry when there is significant view-dependent radiance variation. It does this by proposing a view-dependence normalization technique based on self-supervision from the NeRF model itself.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing VDN-NeRF, a method to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for better geometry reconstruction under non-Lambertian surface and dynamic lighting conditions. The key ideas are:- Analyzing the coupling between the capacity of the view-dependent radiance function and the shape-radiance ambiguity in NeRF optimization. A larger capacity can fit complex radiance variations but also permits degenerated geometry. - Proposing a view-dependence normalization method that aligns the minimality of the shape-radiance ambiguity for different scenes by self-distilling depth features into a neural feature field. This helps constrain the geometry while allowing enough capacity to model radiance variations.- Demonstrating that the proposed method can minimize the effect of shape-radiance ambiguity on geometry. It significantly improves geometry reconstruction on various datasets, especially on a new proposed dataset with dynamic lighting.In summary, this paper studies the inherent shape-radiance ambiguity issue in NeRFs, and proposes a simple yet effective view-dependence normalization technique to attain high-quality geometry without relying on external signals.

Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points of the paper:The paper proposes VDN-NeRF, a method to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to achieve better geometry reconstruction under non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic lighting by normalizing view-dependence through self-distillation of invariant features already encoded in the learned NeRF model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper proposes VDN-NeRF, a novel method to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for reconstructing high-quality 3D geometry from images captured under non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic lighting. The key contributions are:- It analyzes the coupling between the capacity of the view-dependent radiance function and the shape-radiance ambiguity in NeRFs, showing there is a tradeoff between modeling view-dependent effects and avoiding degenerate geometry. - It proposes a view-dependence normalization technique to align the minimality of the shape-radiance ambiguity across scenes. This is done by distilling invariant features from the radiance field to regulate the network training.- It demonstrates state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction on several datasets compared to other volume rendering baselines. The method is also shown to be robust under dynamic lighting where a light source moves with the camera.Compared to other NeRF methods, this work provides new insights into the shape-radiance ambiguity issue for geometry reconstruction. It is among the first to propose view-dependence normalization to alleviate this problem in a simple plug-and-play manner. The most related works are those improving NeRF geometry, such as via explicit surface representation or external depth supervision. However, they do not focus on the shape-radiance ambiguity. Concurrent works like NeRF-W and GROSS also model view-dependent effects but rely on external guidance. The key novelty of VDN-NeRF is the self-distillation of invariant features within the radiance field to regulate view-dependence and improve geometry.Overall, this paper makes important contributions for training high-quality NeRFs. The proposed view-dependence normalization has the potential to benefit many radiance field methods targeting accurate geometry reconstruction from challenging imaging conditions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are some key future research directions suggested in the paper:- Apply the proposed view-dependence normalization technique to other neural radiance field methods for geometric reasoning tasks in unconstrained real-world scenarios. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness on a variety of datasets, but note there is room for further exploration of applications.- Explore different network architectures and training schemes for the feature function to provide illumination invariant information. The current implementation uses a similar MLP architecture as the radiance function, but other options could be investigated. - Evaluate the robustness of the method on more diverse real-world datasets with complex material properties, lighting conditions, and camera poses. The experiments focus on synthetic data and two real datasets - expanding this could further validate the approach.- Study how the technique could generalize to video-based reconstruction of non-rigid dynamic scenes. The current method targets static scenes, but extending it to model temporal changes could be an interesting direction.- Investigate alternatives to distilling view-invariant features for normalizing view-dependence, beyond using a depth prediction network. Are there other self-supervised approaches to extract useful regularization signals?- Analyze how the minimal shape-radiance ambiguity changes for radiance fields modeled with different network architectures. The coupling effect is demonstrated for MLP networks, but could vary with other choices.In summary, the key suggestions are to explore more applications, network designs, training schemes, datasets, and theoretical analysis to further develop view-dependence normalization for high-quality geometry from neural radiance fields.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes VDN-NeRF, a method to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for better geometry under non-Lambertian surface and dynamic lighting conditions that cause view-dependent variations in radiance. Instead of explicitly modeling the underlying factors causing the view-dependence, the method develops a simple technique to normalize the view-dependence by distilling invariant features already encoded in the learned NeRFs. Specifically, a distillation network is used to extract illumination- and viewpoint-invariant features from rendered images. These normalized features are incorporated into the NeRF training to attain high quality geometry. Experiments show the method effectively minimizes the effect of shape-radiance ambiguity and achieves state-of-the-art geometry on challenging scenes with reflective, textureless surfaces under dynamic lighting. The view-dependence normalization aligns the optimal capacity needed for the view-dependent radiance function to explain variations while avoiding degenerate geometry.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes VDN-NeRF, a method to train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for improved geometry reconstruction under non-Lambertian surface reflectance and dynamic lighting conditions. The core idea is to normalize the view-dependence of radiance fields through self-distillation of invariant depth features. The paper first analyzes how the shape-radiance ambiguity presents a tradeoff between the capacity needed to model view-dependent radiance variations versus avoiding degraded geometry. To resolve this, VDN-NeRF introduces a view-dependence normalization technique. This distills invariant depth features from the radiance field using a pretrained depth prediction network. The normalized features help align the view-dependence across scenes so a single optimal capacity can be used. Experiments show VDN-NeRF significantly improves geometry over baselines on challenging scenes with non-Lambertian effects and moving light sources. The method is simple, effective, and directly compatible with existing radiance field methods.

This view-dependence normalization aligns the capacity needed to explain view-dependent variations across scenes, enabling joint optimization for high quality view synthesis and geometry. Experiments show the method improves geometry while retaining details for novel view synthesis on challenging real and synthetic datasets with non-Lambertian effects and uncontrolled lighting.
