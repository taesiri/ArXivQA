# [Supervised Fine-Tuning as Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12017)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Prevailing approaches for aligning large language models (LLMs) rely on preference datasets from human feedback, which can be noisy and not always available.  
- This paper explores using expert demonstration datasets for LLM alignment, which are more accessible in real applications.

Key Ideas
- Formulates auto-regressive LLM generation as a sequential decision process in a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. This links LLM alignment to reinforcement learning concepts.
- Views LLM alignment as an online imitation learning problem, with access to known generation dynamics (transitions) but not reward (human feedback).
- Shows supervised fine-tuning objectives correspond to trajectory distribution matching using forward KL divergence, explaining their "mass-covering" behavior.
- Discusses using reverse KL and Jensen-Shannon divergence for potential "mode-seeking" alignment behaviors.

Key Contributions  
- Provides new perspective on LLM alignment using imitation learning view.
- Links existing supervised fine-tuning to distribution matching characterization.
- Derives new practical objectives for LLM alignment using expert demonstrations, without needing preference datasets.
- Analyzes pros/cons of different divergence matching strategies for open vs close-ended alignment tasks.

Overall, the paper offers a fresh theoretical perspective on LLM alignment using imitation learning, and introduces new alignment algorithms that do not require potentially noisy or unavailable preference datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a formulation of large language model alignment as an imitation learning problem, drawing connections to inverse reinforcement learning and discussing practical objectives based on matching state-action occupancy measures or trajectory distributions using various divergences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) using insights from adversarial imitation learning rather than the prevailing approaches based on reinforcement learning from human feedback. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Formulating auto-regressive LLM generation as a sequential decision-making process that can be analyzed with Markov decision process and reinforcement learning concepts. 

2) Showing that supervised fine-tuning objectives correspond to trajectory-level distribution matching using the forward KL divergence, explaining their mass-covering behavior.

3) Discussing alternative objectives based on reverse KL divergence or Jensen-Shannon divergence that could lead to mode-seeking behaviors. 

4) Deriving practical adversarial learning objectives for LLM alignment without needing explicit preference datasets.

5) Analyzing the assumptions behind approaches like direct preference optimization and discussing scenarios where different alignment methods are most suitable.

Overall, the main novelty is the proposal of using adversarial imitation learning techniques for LLM alignment as an alternative to prevailing preference learning-based methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that learning from demonstration can be more efficient than preference-based learning when strong general-purpose LLM feedback is available. What are the specific advantages and disadvantages of each approach? Under what conditions would you recommend using one over the other? 

2. The paper links auto-regressive LLM generation to a Markov Decision Process framework. What are the implications and insights gained from formalizing the problem in this way compared to more traditional supervised learning formulations? How does it change the way we think about objectives and algorithms?

3. The paper categorizes LLM alignment as an online inverse reinforcement learning problem due to the accessibility of the generation dynamics model during training. What complexities does this add versus offline settings? How can we take advantage of the online access?

4. The paper shows supervised fine-tuning objectives correspond to trajectory distribution matching using the forward KL divergence. What exactly causes the mass-covering behavior and how can other divergences induce mode-seeking instead? 

5. Objectives based on reverse KL divergence and Jensen-Shannon divergence require estimating the probability of on-policy expert actions. Why is this difficult and how do adversarial methods circumvent this issue? What are the limitations?

6. How exactly do the adversarial imitation learning objectives proposed here differ from existing preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization? What different assumptions are made and what are the pros/cons? 

7. The paper analyzes alignment on both state-action occupancy measures versus complete trajectory distributions. What are the trade-offs and in what situations would you choose one over the other?

8. What other f-divergences beyond KL, reverse KL, and JS could be useful for LLM alignment? What properties would they have and how could the objectives differ? 

9. The assumptions behind common preference dataset modeling using Bradley-Terry are discussed. How could we design better algorithms if we relax these assumptions? What other rating systems could apply?

10. How can we extend the imitation learning perspective in this work to leverage both preference and demonstration datasets jointly during LLM alignment? What are promising directions for combining the strengths of both?
