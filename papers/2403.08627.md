# [Multifidelity linear regression for scientific machine learning from   scarce data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08627)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models, specifically linear regression models, when only a limited amount of expensive high-fidelity training data is available. This is a common challenge in scientific applications where generating high-fidelity training data often requires running expensive physics simulations or experiments. ML models trained on scarce high-fidelity data can have high variance and be sensitive to the particular realizations of data in the training set.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new multifidelity training approach that leverages both expensive high-fidelity data as well as cheaper low-fidelity data to improve model robustness. The key ideas are:

1) Define new multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators for the unknown linear regression coefficients that combine high-fidelity data and control variate corrections based on low-fidelity data. This reduces variance while maintaining unbiasedness w.r.t. the high-fidelity distribution.

2) Analyze different strategies for selecting the control variate coefficients and sample allocations across fidelities. Provide theoretical analysis on optimal choices when model statistics are known.

3) Provide practical recommendations when model statistics are unknown, based on approximations from multifidelity Monte Carlo mean estimation.

Key Contributions:

- New multifidelity linear regression method that combines scarce high-fidelity data and cheaper low-fidelity data 
- Multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators for linear regression coefficients with accuracy guarantees
- Analysis of control variate choices and sample allocation strategies
- Demonstration on analytical & computational examples showing significantly improved model robustness and accuracy compared to standard training on only high-fidelity data

The method allows fitting accurate linear regression models using far fewer high-fidelity samples than standard methods, making it promising for surrogate modeling and scientific machine learning with limited budgets.
