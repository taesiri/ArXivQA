# [ATT3D: Amortized Text-to-3D Object Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07349)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we train a single text-to-3D model that can generalize to generate high quality 3D objects from unseen text prompts without needing additional per-prompt optimization?The key hypothesis appears to be that by training the model on a diverse set of text prompts using amortized optimization, the model will learn to share components and patterns across prompts in a way that enables generalization to new prompts.In summary, the paper is proposing and evaluating a method for amortized text-to-3D generation that aims to avoid the need for costly per-prompt optimization at test time. The central hypothesis is that amortized training will enable generalization to unseen prompts.
