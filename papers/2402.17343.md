# [Enhanced Bayesian Optimization via Preferential Modeling of Abstract   Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an efficient method for optimizing expensive black-box functions, but learns only from data gathered during the optimization process. 
- However, human experts have a lot of valuable knowledge and intuition about the system being optimized that could greatly accelerate BO if incorporated.  
- Experts tend to reason in terms of qualitative comparisons of abstract, unmeasured properties rather than quantitative specifics.
- Eliciting and modeling such expert knowledge in a way that benefits BO remains unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a human-AI collaborative BO method called Bayesian Optimization with Abstract Properties (BOAP).  
- Experts provide qualitative pairwise preferences comparing designs based on unmeasured abstract properties.  
- Separate rank Gaussian processes are used to model each abstract property from the preferences.
- The BO input space is augmented with the estimated property values from the rank GPs.  
- A spatial kernel is used in the main GP to reduce the influence of uncertain property estimates.
- A 2-arm scheme with model selection avoids misleading expert feedback.

Main Contributions:
- A principled approach to incorporate preferential expert knowledge about abstract system properties into BO.
- Flexible framework allowing experts to provide intuitive qualitative comparisons rather than quantitative details.
- Robust 2-arm model selection scheme prevents inaccurate expert feedback from misleading optimization.
- Convergence analysis relating BOAP regret bounds to accuracy of expert augmentation.
- Experiments on synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate substantially improved optimization performance.

In summary, the paper introduces a collaborative human-AI framework that allows BO methods to benefit from an expert's higher-level intuitive understanding of the system, while still safeguarding against inaccurate expert knowledge. This allows BO to achieve significantly better sample efficiency.
