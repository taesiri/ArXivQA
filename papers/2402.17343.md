# [Enhanced Bayesian Optimization via Preferential Modeling of Abstract   Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an efficient method for optimizing expensive black-box functions, but learns only from data gathered during the optimization process. 
- However, human experts have a lot of valuable knowledge and intuition about the system being optimized that could greatly accelerate BO if incorporated.  
- Experts tend to reason in terms of qualitative comparisons of abstract, unmeasured properties rather than quantitative specifics.
- Eliciting and modeling such expert knowledge in a way that benefits BO remains unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a human-AI collaborative BO method called Bayesian Optimization with Abstract Properties (BOAP).  
- Experts provide qualitative pairwise preferences comparing designs based on unmeasured abstract properties.  
- Separate rank Gaussian processes are used to model each abstract property from the preferences.
- The BO input space is augmented with the estimated property values from the rank GPs.  
- A spatial kernel is used in the main GP to reduce the influence of uncertain property estimates.
- A 2-arm scheme with model selection avoids misleading expert feedback.

Main Contributions:
- A principled approach to incorporate preferential expert knowledge about abstract system properties into BO.
- Flexible framework allowing experts to provide intuitive qualitative comparisons rather than quantitative details.
- Robust 2-arm model selection scheme prevents inaccurate expert feedback from misleading optimization.
- Convergence analysis relating BOAP regret bounds to accuracy of expert augmentation.
- Experiments on synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate substantially improved optimization performance.

In summary, the paper introduces a collaborative human-AI framework that allows BO methods to benefit from an expert's higher-level intuitive understanding of the system, while still safeguarding against inaccurate expert knowledge. This allows BO to achieve significantly better sample efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a human-AI collaborative Bayesian optimization framework called BOAP that incorporates expert preferential knowledge about unmeasured abstract properties to accelerate the optimization of expensive black-box functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel human-AI collaborative Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOAP) for incorporating expert pairwise preferences on abstract properties via rank Gaussian processes (GPs). Specifically:

(i) They propose a framework to capture expert qualitative inputs about unmeasured abstract properties in the form of pairwise rankings over designs. These rankings are modeled via separate rank GPs.

(ii) The inputs to the main GP surrogate modeling the objective function are augmented with the predictions from the rank GPs to incorporate the expert knowledge.

(iii) To handle potentially inaccurate expert inputs, they use a two-armed bandit approach with a model selection strategy to choose between an augmented model utilizing expert knowledge versus an unaugmented model at each iteration.

(iv) They provide a theoretical discussion on the convergence behavior of the proposed BOAP algorithm.

(v) They demonstrate the superiority of BOAP over standard Bayesian optimization baselines on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world design optimization tasks from battery manufacturing.

In summary, the key contribution is a human-AI collaborative Bayesian optimization framework that can leverage an expert's qualitative judgments about unmeasured abstract properties to accelerate the search for optima.
