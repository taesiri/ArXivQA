# [Towards Transferable Targeted 3D Adversarial Attack in the Physical   World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Transferable targeted adversarial attacks in 3D domain remain unexplored despite extensive research in 2D domain. Transferable targeted 3D attacks can pose greater security threats due to multi-view robustness and physical realizability.  
- Existing 3D attack methods have limitations in simultaneously ensuring attack performance, transferability, natural appearance and physical feasibility. Mesh-based optimizations easily overfit and lack naturalness.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose TT3D framework to generate transferable targeted 3D adversarial textured meshes from multi-view images, without relying on pre-existing 3D model.
- Performs adversarial fine-tuning by dual optimization strategy targeting both feature grid and MLP parameters in grid-based NeRF space. Avoids overfitting in mesh space.
- Additional vertex coordinate optimization enhances attack performance. Constraints and losses ensure natural appearance. Expectation over Transformation (EOT) handles physical world variations.

Main Contributions:
- First framework for transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks, eliminating previous reliance on 3D meshes. Expands feasible region of attacks.
- Dual optimization strategy perturbs at both feature and decision layers, improving transferability and naturalness. 
- Experiments show strong cross-model, cross-render, cross-task transferability. Physical attacks via 3D printing demonstrate real-world robustness.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework TT3D that generates physically realizable and natural looking 3D adversarial examples that can launch targeted attacks with high transferability across models, tasks and rendering systems. The dual optimization strategy and ability to craft attacks from just multi-view images are the main innovations.
