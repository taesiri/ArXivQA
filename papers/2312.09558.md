# [Towards Transferable Targeted 3D Adversarial Attack in the Physical   World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Transferable targeted adversarial attacks in 3D domain remain unexplored despite extensive research in 2D domain. Transferable targeted 3D attacks can pose greater security threats due to multi-view robustness and physical realizability.  
- Existing 3D attack methods have limitations in simultaneously ensuring attack performance, transferability, natural appearance and physical feasibility. Mesh-based optimizations easily overfit and lack naturalness.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose TT3D framework to generate transferable targeted 3D adversarial textured meshes from multi-view images, without relying on pre-existing 3D model.
- Performs adversarial fine-tuning by dual optimization strategy targeting both feature grid and MLP parameters in grid-based NeRF space. Avoids overfitting in mesh space.
- Additional vertex coordinate optimization enhances attack performance. Constraints and losses ensure natural appearance. Expectation over Transformation (EOT) handles physical world variations.

Main Contributions:
- First framework for transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks, eliminating previous reliance on 3D meshes. Expands feasible region of attacks.
- Dual optimization strategy perturbs at both feature and decision layers, improving transferability and naturalness. 
- Experiments show strong cross-model, cross-render, cross-task transferability. Physical attacks via 3D printing demonstrate real-world robustness.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework TT3D that generates physically realizable and natural looking 3D adversarial examples that can launch targeted attacks with high transferability across models, tasks and rendering systems. The dual optimization strategy and ability to craft attacks from just multi-view images are the main innovations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel framework called TT3D that can rapidly reconstruct multi-view images into transferable targeted 3D adversarial textured meshes with guaranteed naturalness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel framework called TT3D for generating transferable targeted 3D adversarial examples. This is the first work to fill the gap in transferable targeted 3D attacks and eliminates the previous reliance on pre-existing 3D meshes, expanding the feasible region of 3D attacks.

2. It designs a dual optimization strategy within the grid-based NeRF space, which perturbs at both the foundational feature level and more advanced decision-making layers of neural networks. This ensures attack effectiveness and naturalness. 

3. Experimental results demonstrate the method's strong cross-model transferability and adaptability across different renders and vision tasks. The feasibility of physical attacks is also validated through 3D printing.

In summary, the key innovation is the TT3D framework which enables transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks with good naturalness and cross-domain robustness, filling an important vacant niche. The dual optimization strategy and experimental validations are also significant contributions.

The paper proposes a novel framework called TT3D for generating transferable targeted 3D adversarial examples. It performs optimization in the grid-based NeRF space instead of directly manipulating the mesh. The dual optimization targets both the feature grid parameters and MLP parameters in NeRF. EOT is used to enhance robustness for physical attacks. Experiments show cross-model, cross-render and cross-task transferability of the generated examples. 3D printing is used to create physical adversarial objects. The method also maintains naturalness of the adversarial examples compared to other techniques.
