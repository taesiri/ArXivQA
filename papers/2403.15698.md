## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Scene$\mathcal{X}$: Procedural Controllable Large-scale Scene Generation via Large-language Models":

Problem: 
Generating large-scale 3D scenes like cities or landscapes is very time-consuming and requires profound expertise in procedural modeling. Recent learning-based methods for scene generation produce scenes incompatible for deployment in real applications due to lack of clear geometry and textures. There is a need for an automatic scene generation method that can create industry-compatible, controllable, and customizable large-scale scenes rapidly.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Scene$\mathcal{X}$, a framework that can automatically generate high-quality procedural 3D scene assets based on textual descriptions provided by users. The key components are:

1) PCGBench: A large dataset containing procedural modeling plugins, 3D assets, documentation of modeling APIs, and annotations to enable retrieval. 

2) PCGPlanner: An agent-based pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to plan tasks, retrieve suitable assets/APIs from PCGBench, and execute procedural modeling actions to construct 3D scenes incrementally.

Main Contributions:

1) PCGBench provides extensive procedural modeling resources to empower automatic large-scale scene creation.

2) PCGPlanner enables end-to-end controllable procedural scene generation from text descriptions using LLMs, without needing expertise.

3) Scene$\mathcal{X}$ can efficiently generate industry-compatible, customizable, high quality scenes like a 2.5km x 2.5km city in 20 hours instead of weeks by experts.

4) It supports controllable editing by adding/removing objects, changing materials/layouts etc. as per user's textual instructions.

In summary, Scene$\mathcal{X}$ advances automatic controllable large-scale 3D scene generation for industry use by combining procedural modeling with the reasoning capacity of LLMs, requiring only intuitive textual descriptions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SceneX, a framework that uses large language models to drive procedural modeling for automatic controllable large-scale 3D scene generation from textual descriptions, achieving efficiency, diversity, and high visual quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Scene$\mathcal{X}$, a framework for large-scale scene generation that can automatically generate high-quality procedural models according to designers' textual descriptions. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a PCGBench that collects extensive accessible procedural assets and thousands of hand-crafted API documents to achieve efficient and diverse scene generation.

2) Developing a PCGPlanner framework comprising task planning, asset retrieval, and action execution stages to produce executable actions for Blender to generate controllable and precise 3D assets following user instructions. 

3) Demonstrating Scene$\mathcal{X}$'s capabilities in efficient large-scale scene generation, reducing the time from weeks to hours compared to manual work. It also shows controllability for personalized editing like asset placement and season translation.

4) Extensive experiments validate the efficiency, controllability and diversity of Scene$\mathcal{X}$ in generating high-quality large-scale scenes. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate its effectiveness.

In summary, the main contribution is developing the Scene$\mathcal{X}$ framework to achieve efficient, controllable and diverse large-scale scene generation automatically based on textual descriptions. The integration of the PCGBench and PCGPlanner empowers this capability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework called Scene$\mathcal{X}$ for large-scale scene generation. What are the two main components of this framework and what role does each component play?

2. The PCGBench component contains extensive procedural assets and API documents. Why are the API documents necessary, and how do they help in training the language models used in the PCGPlanner component? 

3. The PCGPlanner uses multiple "agents" with specific roles. Explain the different agents used, their responsibilities, and how they work together in the overall workflow. 

4. The retrieval agent uses CLIP for text-to-text and text-to-image retrieval. Why is retrieval needed in this framework, and how does using CLIP embeddings help with the retrieval process?

5. The paper claims the proposed method is efficient, controllable and diverse compared to existing methods. Elaborate on these claims by explaining how the design of Scene$\mathcal{X}$ leads to better efficiency, controllability and diversity.  

6. The task planner consists of a dispatch agent and specialist agent that operate iteratively. Explain why an iterative process with two different agents is beneficial here compared to using a single planner agent.

7. Ablation studies in the paper analyze the impact of different prompt components. What were the most and least impactful prompt components identified? Explain why you think those particular components had high or low impact.

8. The paper shows both natural and urban scene generation results. What particular advantages does the proposed procedural modeling approach offer compared to learning-based methods when it comes to generating realistic, large-scale city scenes? 

9. The paper claims a significant reduction in generation time compared to manual modeling and an existing procedural approach (Infinigen). Quantitatively analyze and explain the extent of time savings demonstrated. 

10. What are some limitations of the current work, and what future research directions are proposed that could help address those limitations?
