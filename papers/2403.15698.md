## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Scene$\mathcal{X}$: Procedural Controllable Large-scale Scene Generation via Large-language Models":

Problem: 
Generating large-scale 3D scenes like cities or landscapes is very time-consuming and requires profound expertise in procedural modeling. Recent learning-based methods for scene generation produce scenes incompatible for deployment in real applications due to lack of clear geometry and textures. There is a need for an automatic scene generation method that can create industry-compatible, controllable, and customizable large-scale scenes rapidly.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Scene$\mathcal{X}$, a framework that can automatically generate high-quality procedural 3D scene assets based on textual descriptions provided by users. The key components are:

1) PCGBench: A large dataset containing procedural modeling plugins, 3D assets, documentation of modeling APIs, and annotations to enable retrieval. 

2) PCGPlanner: An agent-based pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to plan tasks, retrieve suitable assets/APIs from PCGBench, and execute procedural modeling actions to construct 3D scenes incrementally.

Main Contributions:

1) PCGBench provides extensive procedural modeling resources to empower automatic large-scale scene creation.

2) PCGPlanner enables end-to-end controllable procedural scene generation from text descriptions using LLMs, without needing expertise.

3) Scene$\mathcal{X}$ can efficiently generate industry-compatible, customizable, high quality scenes like a 2.5km x 2.5km city in 20 hours instead of weeks by experts.

4) It supports controllable editing by adding/removing objects, changing materials/layouts etc. as per user's textual instructions.

In summary, Scene$\mathcal{X}$ advances automatic controllable large-scale 3D scene generation for industry use by combining procedural modeling with the reasoning capacity of LLMs, requiring only intuitive textual descriptions.
