# [PaSS: Parallel Speculative Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13581)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called Parallel Speculative Sampling (PaSS) to accelerate the decoding speed of large language models. The key idea is to leverage parallel decoding to generate multiple token candidates in one model call, instead of using a separate smaller "drafter" model like in prior speculative sampling techniques. Specifically, the authors introduce learned "look-ahead" embeddings that allow the model to predict several tokens ahead. In the drafting phase, these embeddings are appended to prompt to generate multiple candidates. Then in the validation phase, a second model call checks and potentially accepts the candidates based on target logits. This avoids needing two separate models. Experiments demonstrate PaSS gives up to 30% faster decoding over autoregressive generation on text and code completion, with similar performance. The method only adds a small number of extra parameters for the look-ahead embeddings, making it easy to apply. Key benefits are no quality loss and no second model requirement. Limitations are less speedup than methods with a separate drafter model. Overall, PaSS offers a lightweight way to leverage parallel decoding to accelerate large language model inference.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes Parallel Speculative Sampling (PaSS), a method to speed up decoding from large language models by generating multiple tokens in parallel using additional "look-ahead" embeddings, while preserving generation quality.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Parallel Speculative Sampling (PaSS) to speed up text generation from large language models. The key idea is to leverage parallel decoding to generate multiple candidate tokens in one model call, instead of using a separate "drafter" model like in prior speculative sampling techniques. Specifically, the method introduces learned "look-ahead" embeddings that allow the model to predict several tokens ahead in parallel. It then validates these tokens using the rejection sampling scheme from speculative sampling to guarantee no loss in quality. The method is shown to provide speedups of up to 30% on text and code generation tasks, with minimal overhead from only learning $O(d_{emb})$ new parameters. A key advantage over prior speculative sampling is avoiding the need for a second model by directly using parallel decoding with the target model itself. The paper demonstrates the approach can accelerate decoding from large models without impacting final text quality or model performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Parallel Speculative Sampling (PaSS) to speed up text generation from large language models by generating multiple tokens in parallel, validating them with the target model, and keeping only the valid ones, resulting in faster decoding with no quality loss.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:

How can we accelerate the decoding speed of large language models without needing a separate "drafter" model like in speculative sampling, while still maintaining the same high quality generations?

The key ideas proposed to address this are:

1) Using parallel decoding to generate multiple token candidates directly from the target large language model in one forward pass (the "drafting phase"). This avoids needing a separate drafter model.

2) Validating the drafted tokens by sampling and checking if they match the distribution of the large language model (the "validation phase"). This maintains the same sample quality.

3) Introducing small "look-ahead" embeddings that are tuned on a small dataset to give the model the ability to generate multiple tokens in parallel. This enables parallel decoding without changing the base model.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that you can accelerate decoding by parallel generation from a single model, without quality loss, by using specialized look-ahead embeddings. The method proposed to test this hypothesis is the Parallel Speculative Sampling (PaSS) algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a variant of speculative sampling called Parallel Speculative Sampling (PaSS) for faster decoding from large language models. The key ideas are:

- Use parallel decoding to generate multiple token candidates from a single model in one forward pass, avoiding the need for a separate "drafter" model like in regular speculative sampling. This is done by adding learned "look-ahead embeddings" to the input.

- Guarantee at least one new accepted token per model call, ensuring it is at least as fast as auto-regressive decoding. Additional drafted tokens can provide further speedup. 

- Require only a small number (O(d_emb)) of extra trainable parameters for the look-ahead embeddings, much less than adding a whole separate model.

- Show experimentally that PaSS provides up to 30% faster decoding versus auto-regressive generation on text and code generation tasks, with no degradation in output quality.

So in summary, the main contribution is a way to accelerate decoding from large language models that is simple to implement, has minimal overhead, and preserves output quality.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper compares to other research in speculative sampling and parallel decoding for accelerating language model inference in several key ways:

1. Compared to other speculative sampling methods like Chen et al. and Leviathan et al., this paper does not require a separate "drafter" model. Instead, it uses parallel decoding from a single model to generate draft tokens. This avoids the need to have two models with aligned vocabularies.

2. Compared to other parallel decoding methods like Ghazvininejad et al. and Gu et al., this paper does not require architectural changes to the language model. It simply adds trained "look ahead" embeddings that allow parallel token prediction. This makes it more suitable for accelerating existing pre-trained LMs.

3. Compared to Stern et al. and Medusa, this paper has lower memory overhead by adding embeddings rather than classification heads. It also focuses on general decoding rather than just greedy decoding.

4. Compared to Zhang et al., this paper still uses parallel decoding to accelerate inference rather than just auto-regressive decoding.

5. Overall, this paper combines strengths of both speculative sampling and parallel decoding to accelerate inference from a single pre-trained LM without architectural modifications or a second aligned model. The memory overhead is just O(d_emb) extra parameters for the look ahead embeddings.

In summary, this paper compares favorably to other related work by avoiding downsides like requiring two models or making architectural changes. The parallel speculative sampling method appears simple yet effective for accelerating existing LMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the conclusion section, the authors suggest the following future research direction:

Explore how to improve the quality of parallel generation with look-ahead tokens, as they believe this is the most promising direction to improve performance of the Parallel Speculative Sampling (PaSS) algorithm.

Specifically, the concluding paragraph states:

"In future work, we want to explore how to improve the quality of parallel generation with look-ahead tokens, as we believe this is the most promising direction to improve performance of the PaSS algorithm."

So the main future direction suggested is to find ways to get better parallel generations using the look-ahead tokens idea from their PaSS algorithm. This seems to be where they see the most potential to further speed up decoding while maintaining quality.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Speculative sampling - The core method for accelerating decoding by using a smaller "drafter" model to generate candidate tokens that are validated by the larger target model.

- Parallel decoding - Generating multiple tokens in parallel from a language model, instead of auto-regressively token-by-token. Used in the proposed parallel speculative sampling method. 

- Look-ahead embeddings - Additional input tokens like [LA]_i that are added to parallel decode multiple steps ahead. Require only small overhead to train.

- Inference acceleration - Key goal of speculative sampling and parallel speculative sampling methods. Achieved by parallelizing the decoding process.

- Auto-regressive models - Standard transformer models that normally decode tokens one-by-one. Made parallel through speculative sampling.

- Drafting phase - First phase of the parallel speculative sampling method where multiple tokens are generated in parallel.

- Validation phase - Second phase where the drafted tokens are validated by the target model.

So in summary, the key terms cover speculative sampling, parallel decoding, look-ahead embeddings, inference acceleration, and the drafting and validation phases of the parallel speculative sampling approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Parallel Speculative Sampling (PaSS) as an alternative to existing speculative sampling methods. How exactly does PaSS differ in its approach and what are the key advantages it provides over prior speculative sampling techniques?

2. One of the main ideas behind PaSS is the use of "look-ahead embeddings" for parallel decoding during the drafting phase. Can you explain in detail how these embeddings work and how they enable the model to predict multiple tokens simultaneously? 

3. The paper states that PaSS has a memory overhead of only O(d_emb) compared to existing speculative sampling methods. Walk through the analysis of why the memory overhead is lower with PaSS and quantify the differences in overhead with numerical examples.

4. Explain the drafting and validation phases and how the target language model is called in each phase. What guarantees does this two-phase approach provide in terms of sequence quality and algorithm speed?

5. The acceptance criteria for drafted tokens involves sampling from a uniform distribution and comparing target model probabilities. Derive the mathematical justification behind this acceptance criteria and show formally why it preserves sequence quality.  

6. One downside mentioned is that PaSS requires two model calls per iteration compared to speculative sampling. Propose some ideas/heuristics to reduce the number of required model calls while retaining the benefits of PaSS.

7. The experiments show that PaSS speedups increase as sampling temperature decreases. Intuitively explain this observation and discuss how temperature impacts the token distributions. 

8. The paper evaluates PaSS on text and code generation tasks. Discuss if you expect greater or smaller speedups when applying PaSS to other modalities like images, audio, video etc.

9. The results show diminishing returns in speedup beyond 6 lookahead steps. Diagnose the likely reasons behind this trend and propose ideas to further scale the lookahead.

10. Compared to previous parallel decoding methods like insertion-based decoding, discuss the comparative advantages and disadvantages of using trained lookahead embeddings over inserted mask tokens.
