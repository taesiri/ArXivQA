# [DiffiT: Diffusion Vision Transformers for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02139)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DiffiT, a novel transformer-based architecture for diffusion models in generative image synthesis. The key innovation is a time-dependent self-attention (TMSA) module that enables attention layers to dynamically adapt their behavior over sampling time steps. This allows capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies more effectively throughout the denoising process. The complete architecture, DiffiT, consists of a U-shaped encoder-decoder with TMSA modules in a hierarchical design. For high-resolution image generation, a latent DiffiT model with a pure transformer backbone is introduced. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, including a best FID of 1.73 on ImageNet-256. The visual results showcase DiffiT's ability to generate diverse, high-fidelity images with details at multiple scales. Ablation studies provide insight into optimal dimensionality, effectiveness of components, integration of time embeddings, and analysis of the time-dependent attention maps. Overall, DiffiT sets a new state-of-the-art for transformer architectures in diffusion-based generative models.
