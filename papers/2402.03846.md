# [Efficient Generation of Hidden Outliers for Improved Outlier Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating realistic synthetic outliers is important for improving outlier detection methods. However, most existing outlier generation methods do not create outliers that demonstrate the "multiple views" property common in high-dimensional outliers.
- Hidden outliers exhibit the "multiple views" property by being detectable in some subspaces but not in the full feature space. However, efficiently generating hidden outliers is challenging. The only existing method (Hidden) relies heavily on a tuning parameter that is difficult to set properly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proves an important theoretical result showing that under reasonable assumptions, there always exist hidden outliers between an inlier point and a full-space outlier point. 
- Leveraging this, the paper proposes a new method called Bisect to efficiently generate hidden outliers by searching along the line segment between an inlier and outlier via bisection.
- Bisect does not rely on any tuning parameters and provides guarantees on finding hidden outliers with good time complexity.

Main Contributions:
- Proof of existence of hidden outliers under versatile conditions (Hidden Outlier Existence Proposition)
- New Bisect algorithm to efficiently generate hidden outliers with convergence guarantees and no tuning parameters
- Demonstration of using Bisect-generated outliers to significantly improve outlier detection performance in tasks like one-class classification and supervised outlier detection
- Sharing of code for Bisect implementation and experiments showing performance gains

In summary, the key innovation is an efficient way to generate realistic synthetic outliers (Bisect) along with theory showing such outliers exist and can improve outlier detection. Experiments validate accuracy gains from using Bisect-generated outliers for tasks like one-class classification.
