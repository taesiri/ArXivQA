# [ChatGPT and biometrics: an assessment of face recognition, gender   detection, and age estimation capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02965)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, for various biometric tasks including face recognition, gender detection, and age estimation. As biometric data is sensitive, ChatGPT avoids directly answering prompts about it. Therefore, the authors devised a strategy to bypass ChatGPT's safeguards by emphasizing in the prompts that the facial images were AI-generated. 

The paper evaluates ChatGPT's face recognition abilities using the LFW, AgeDB and CFP-FP datasets. Results show ChatGPT can differentiate between identities with 95.15% accuracy on LFW, comparable to a specialized face recognition model. Performance drops on datasets with more age variation and pose changes. ChatGPT analyzes facial features and shapes to determine matches, sometimes providing persuasive but incorrect explanations on false positives.

For gender detection, ChatGPT achieved 100% accuracy on a dataset of real faces, outperforming DeepFace (99% accuracy). It also correctly classified challenging synthetic faces with blended gender features made using a novel Eyes-to-Face technique. 

On age estimation using the UTKFace dataset, ChatGPT attained 74.25% accuracy by predicting wide age ranges that the true ages fell within. Performance was also strong on synthetic faces. ChatGPT examines skin, wrinkles, hair etc. to estimate ages.

In summary, this paper demonstrates ChatGPT has promising capabilities for biometrics tasks, achieving remarkable performance without any specialized training. The results highlight the potential for LLMs as general foundation models applicable across diverse tasks including biometrics. However, ChatGPT can also generate misleading persuasive explanations, so caution is still warranted in relying on its outputs. The findings open up new research directions on robustness of LLMs and their further applications in biometrics.
