# [LLMs for Relational Reasoning: How Far are We?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09042)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) is important for determining their capability for artificial general intelligence. 
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating reasoning ability like arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, etc. are too simple and insufficient.
- Evaluating performance on more complex reasoning tasks like planning sequential decisions (e.g. blocksworld) shows LLMs still perform poorly.  
- Relational reasoning is another crucial ability closely tied to logical thinking and problem solving. However, LLMs have not been evaluated on this ability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the first comprehensive evaluation pipeline to assess LLMs' relational reasoning ability using inductive logic programming (ILP) benchmarks.
- The pipeline allows evaluating both LLMs and neural program induction models with input/output examples represented as truth value matrices or natural language.
- State-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLama-2 and a neural program induction model (DLM) are evaluated.

Key Findings:
- LLMs achieve high performance on simpler ILP tasks but struggle on more complex ones requiring intricate reasoning logic. Case studies show models make logical errors.  
- DLM with far fewer parameters outperforms LLMs on most tasks, showing superior reasoning ability despite smaller model size.
- LLMs show inconsistent performance with truth value vs natural language prompting across tasks.
- State-of-the-art prompting techniques are unable to consistently improve LLM performance.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive set of benchmarks to evaluate relational reasoning ability of LLMs
- Detailed analysis showing LLMs' reasoning ability is still lacking compared to dedicated models 
- Universal pipeline enabling standardized assessment of reasoning skills for different AI models

In summary, the paper clearly exposes deficiencies in LLMs' reasoning abilities compared to other models, highlighting the need for continued research to achieve more human-like common sense reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a pipeline to evaluate large language models' and neural program induction models' abilities in relational reasoning, finding that current LLMs still underperform compared to specialized neural program induction models on challenging relational reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a general and extensible relational reasoning ability assessment pipeline for evaluating both large language models (LLMs) and neural program induction models. Specifically, the paper:

1) Implements a pipeline that can evaluate relational reasoning ability using both truth value and natural language prompting. This allows comprehensive assessment of different models.

2) Conducts the first in-depth evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs' relational reasoning abilities and compares them to a neural program induction model. 

3) Shows that LLMs still have inferior relational reasoning compared to a much smaller neural program induction model, especially on more complex tasks. Their performance drops significantly when requiring more complex reasoning.

4) Demonstrates that current prompting techniques are not generally effective at improving LLMs' relational reasoning abilities on the benchmarks tested.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an evaluation pipeline to deeply assess and compare LLMs' relational reasoning capacities, revealing they have room for improvement compared to models specializing in this area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with this paper appear to be:

1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
2. Relational Reasoning
3. Program Induction

The paper focuses on evaluating the relational reasoning abilities of Large Language Models by using inductive logic programming benchmarks and comparing with neural program induction systems. So the key concepts/terms revolve around those ideas related to LLMs, the ability to reason about relationships, and inducing logic programs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a universal evaluation pipeline for relational reasoning ability assessment. What are the key components of this pipeline and how do they work together to enable the assessment?

2. The sample generator tool is used to generate random data points represented as truth value matrices. What is the rationale behind using truth value matrices rather than other data representations? What are the advantages and limitations?

3. The paper evaluates performance under IID and OOD settings. Explain what IID and OOD refer to in the context of this work and why evaluating both settings provides a more comprehensive assessment. 

4. For the family tree reasoning tasks, how is the IID test set generated differently from the OOD test set? Explain the rationale behind this.

5. The paper finds the chain-of-thought prompting technique is not generally effective for the relational reasoning tasks evaluated. Analyze the possible reasons why chain-of-thought prompting does not provide benefits for relational reasoning.

6. The neural program induction model DLM outperforms the LLMs on most tasks despite being much smaller. Explain the architectural properties and inductive biases of DLM that make it suitable for program induction.

7. The LLMs struggle with more complex relational reasoning tasks in the benchmark that require longer logic chains. Suggest methods to enhance LLMs to better handle complex relational reasoning.  

8. The GPT models tested have limitations on sequence length. Discuss how this constraint could negatively impact performance on relational reasoning tasks.

9. For the graph reasoning tasks, the LLMs show more consistent performance between natural language prompting and truth value prompting. Provide possible explanations for this observation.

10. The paper focuses on inductive logic programming tasks. Discuss how the evaluation pipeline could be extended to assess performance on other logical reasoning paradigms.
