# [Evaluating Explainable AI: Which Algorithmic Explanations Help Users   Predict Model Behavior?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01831)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Which algorithmic explanations help users best predict model behavior?

The authors evaluate different explanation methods (LIME, Anchor, Decision Boundary, Prototype, Composite) through human subject experiments to see which ones improve people's ability to simulate model predictions on new inputs (forward simulation) and perturbed inputs (counterfactual simulation). Their hypothesis seems to be that combining complementary explanations will improve simulatability, but their results show clear improvements only for LIME on tabular data and the Prototype method on counterfactual tests.

In summary, the key research question is evaluating which explanation techniques actually help users understand and simulate model predictions across different data domains. The experiments aim to provide the first reliable estimates of how explanations influence simulatability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The authors carry out human subject tests to evaluate how well different explanation methods improve the interpretability of machine learning models, as measured by users' ability to simulate model behavior. This is the first study that properly isolates the effect of explanations on simulatability.

2. They test five different explanation methods (LIME, Anchor, Decision Boundary, Prototype, and Composite) across text and tabular classification tasks. 

3. Their results show that only LIME for tabular data and the Prototype method for counterfactual simulation reliably improve simulatability. Other methods do not definitively improve it.

4. They find that subjective user ratings of explanation quality do not predict how helpful the explanations actually are for simulating model behavior. 

5. The authors argue their results indicate we need to be careful about the metrics used to evaluate explanations, and that there is room for improvement in current explanation methods.

In summary, the main contribution is conducting rigorous human subject tests to measure how well explanations from different methods improve the interpretability of models, as assessed by simulatability. This is the first study to properly isolate the effect of explanations themselves. The results show that many current methods do not reliably improve simulatability, highlighting the need for better evaluation metrics and methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on evaluating and comparing this paper to other research in the field of explainable AI:

- The paper presents extensive human subject experiments to directly measure the impact of explanations on model simulatability. This is a strength compared to many papers that only evaluate explanations indirectly or via automatic metrics. The large-scale study provides reliable empirical results.

- The study design isolates the effect of explanations by measuring user performance with and without access to explanations. This allows the authors to quantify the improvements gained specifically from the explanations. Many studies fail to include this control.  

- The paper evaluates multiple explanation methods (LIME, Anchor, Prototype, Decision Boundary, Composite) across two data domains (text and tabular). Evaluating a diverse set of methods makes the results more robust.

- The inclusion of both forward and counterfactual simulation tests provides a comprehensive evaluation of simulatability. Counterfactual evaluation is especially important for measuring how well users can anticipate model behavior on new inputs.

- The use of balanced datasets prevents users from relying on simple heuristics like guessing the true label. This makes the simulation tests more rigorous.

- The analysis of subjective ratings in relation to explanation effectiveness is insightful. The lack of correlation between ratings and test accuracy suggests ratings alone may not indicate helpfulness.

Overall, this paper stands out for its rigorous experimental methodology and design choices that isolate the effect of explanations. The breadth of methods and tasks also strengthens the results. The findings provide valuable guidance for developing better explanation techniques and evaluation procedures.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing better methods for generating counterfactual examples and perturbations for evaluating explanation methods, especially ones that stay within the true data distribution. The authors note some limitations in how they generated counterfactual text examples.

- Exploring ways to improve user memory and learning during the forward simulation tests. The authors observe that having to recall insights from an earlier learning phase made the forward test challenging. Different formats like allowing reference sheets could help.

- Comparing explanation methods in terms of computation time and coverage efficiency. The authors mention that methods like LIME and Anchor have ways to efficiently cover the space of inputs that they did not utilize in this study. 

- Evaluating whether explanation methods lead to fairness, trust, and other benefits. This study focused only on simulatability, but other goals of interpretability could be examined.

- Developing better automatic evaluation metrics for explanations that go beyond just checking effects on counterfactuals. The authors suggest eliciting diverse human judgments on concrete examples is valuable.

- Improving current explanation methods, since the authors found there is significant room for improvement in how well explanations aided understanding across tasks.

In summary, the main future directions highlighted are: better evaluation practices, especially for counterfactuals; improving current tests and explanation methods; and expanding the evaluation to other interpretability desiderata beyond just simulatability.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents human subject experiments to evaluate different explanation methods for machine learning models. The goal is to measure how well explanations help users simulate model behavior, which indicates if the explanations improve interpretability. The authors test five explanation methods (LIME, Anchor, Decision Boundary, Prototype, and Composite) on text and tabular classification tasks. The evaluation uses simulation tests where users first predict model outputs on new data points (forward simulation), then predict outputs on counterfactual versions of data points (counterfactual simulation). Explanations of model behavior on training data are provided in between the simulation tests. The change in user accuracy from the first to second tests measures the effect of the explanations. By isolating explanations as the only difference between tests, the authors can estimate how much each method helps users simulate model predictions. Subjective ratings of explanation quality are also collected. The results indicate LIME improves simulatability on tabular data, and the Prototype method helps on counterfactual tests. In general, combining methods does not improve simulatability. The authors conclude that current explanation methods may not consistently help users understand models, and subjective ratings do not predict explanation effectiveness.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Evaluating Explainable AI: Which Algorithmic Explanations Help Users Predict Model Behavior?" is addressing the problem of how to effectively evaluate different explainable AI methods. Specifically, it is investigating which types of algorithmic explanations actually help users better understand and predict the behavior of machine learning models. 

The key questions the paper seeks to address are:

- How can we isolate and measure the effect of algorithmic explanations on users' ability to simulate model behavior?

- Do current explanation methods like LIME, Anchor, prototype models, etc. definitively improve users' forward and counterfactual simulatability?

- How do subjective user ratings of explanation quality relate to the actual usefulness of explanations for simulating model behavior?

- Can users predict which explanations will be most effective based on subjective quality judgments?

To summarize, the paper is tackling the challenge of rigorously evaluating different explainable AI techniques to determine which ones truly enhance users' understanding and ability to simulate model behavior, as measured through human subject experiments. It aims to uncover which methods work best and whether user perceptions align with actual explanation effectiveness.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents human subject tests evaluating five different explanation methods for machine learning models: LIME, Anchor, Decision Boundary, Prototype, and Composite. The goal is to measure how well these explanations help users predict model behavior on new inputs (simulatability). The authors conduct forward simulation tests, where users predict outputs for new inputs after seeing explained examples, and counterfactual simulation tests, where users predict outputs for edited inputs after seeing explanations for the originals. The results show that LIME improves simulatability for tabular data, and the Prototype method helps for counterfactual tests across text and tabular domains. Otherwise, the methods do not definitively improve simulatability together for any setting. The authors also collect subjective ratings of explanation quality, finding these are not predictive of explanation effectiveness. Overall, the results suggest we must be careful in evaluating methods, and there is room for improvement. The paper presents the first comprehensive human evaluation isolating the effect of explanations on simulatability across methods and data domains.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper evaluates different explanation methods for machine learning models through human subject experiments. The goal is to determine if explanations improve people's ability to predict how a model will behave on new inputs (called simulatability). The authors test five different explanation methods (LIME, Anchor, Decision Boundary, Prototype, and Composite) on text and tabular classification tasks. They conduct carefully designed forward and counterfactual simulation tests with over 2100 responses. The results show that only LIME reliably improves simulatability for tabular data, and the Prototype method helps for counterfactual tests. No single method improves simulatability definitively across tasks. The authors conclude that current explanation methods still have significant room for improvement, and we must be careful in evaluating them. They recommend measuring simulatability directly through human experiments rather than relying on subjective ratings of explanation quality. This is the first comprehensive evaluation isolating the effect of explanations on simulatability across methods and data domains.
