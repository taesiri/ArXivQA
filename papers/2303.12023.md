# [Logical Reasoning over Natural Language as Knowledge Representation: A   Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12023)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question of this paper is: How can natural language be used as knowledge representation for logical reasoning, overcoming challenges with traditional formal representations? 

The key points are:

- Traditionally, logical reasoning in AI uses formal languages like first-order logic as knowledge representation. However, this has faced challenges like brittleness, knowledge acquisition bottleneck, inability to handle raw natural language input, sensitivity to errors, etc. 

- Recently, there is a new paradigm of using natural language as the knowledge representation for logical reasoning instead. Pretrained language models (PLMs) are used as the reasoning engine. 

- This paper provides a comprehensive survey of this new paradigm of "logical reasoning over natural language" (LRNL). It reviews the literature on using LRNL for the three main types of logical reasoning - deductive, inductive and abductive reasoning.

- LRNL has advantages over formal representations like being less brittle, alleviating the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, handling raw text input, and being robust to errors. It also has benefits over pure neural methods like interpretability, controllability, and less catastrophic forgetting.

- The paper summarizes task formulations, datasets, methods, challenges, and future directions for LRNL across deductive, inductive and abductive reasoning. It aims to provide a unified view of using natural language as knowledge representation for logical reasoning.

In summary, the central focus is surveying and analyzing the emerging paradigm of performing logical reasoning by using natural language as knowledge representation instead of formal representations.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions:

- Exploring probabilistic inference: The authors note that in reality, pure deductive reasoning is not always used. Modeling uncertainty through probabilistic inference could be beneficial. 

- Reasoning with incomplete information: Most proof generation work assumes all necessary premises are provided. More work on handling missing premises, as is common in real applications, is needed.

- Inductive reasoning on web corpora: Current inductive reasoning datasets provide curated facts for rule generation. Applying inductive reasoning directly on raw web text could be explored. 

- Abductive reasoning with long theories: Most current abductive reasoning research uses no theory or short synthetic theories. Testing on more realistic long theories (e.g. medical knowledge) could be valuable.

- Interactions between reasoning types: Most work focuses on individual reasoning types. Exploring approaches that combine multiple reasoning types (e.g. using inductive reasoning to build a deductive knowledge base) could be promising.  

- Understanding internal reasoning mechanisms: Current work focuses on task performance. Analyzing the internal reasoning process of models could provide useful insights.

- Applications: Applying logical reasoning over natural language to real world applications like medical diagnosis and legal NLP could demonstrate benefits over traditional symbolic or neural approaches.

In summary, the authors highlight opportunities for more complex and realistic reasoning scenarios, combining reasoning types, analyzing model internals, and applying the paradigm to impactful applications.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes a new paradigm for logical reasoning that uses natural language as the knowledge representation and pretrained language models (PLMs) as the reasoner. Past research in AI has used formal languages like first-order logic for knowledge representation and symbolic reasoners. However, that approach faced challenges like brittleness, knowledge acquisition bottlenecks, inability to handle raw natural language inputs, and sensitivity to label errors. The new paradigm alleviates these issues by leveraging the knowledge contained in PLMs, utilizing natural language corpora for knowledge, and representing concepts as embeddings. 

The paper surveys research on this paradigm for the three main types of logical reasoning - deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning. For each reasoning type, it summarizes the task formulations, datasets, and methods. It also discusses the advantages of the new paradigm over symbolic methods and end-to-end neural methods. Challenges like computational efficiency, reliability, evaluation metrics, and interpretability are outlined. Finally, future directions are suggested, including integrating probabilistic reasoning, reasoning with incomplete information, inductive reasoning from corpora, abductive reasoning with long theories, interactions between reasoning types, and applications. Overall, the survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging research area of logical reasoning over natural language.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a modular framework for deductive reasoning that uses natural language as the knowledge representation and pretrained language models (PLMs) as the reasoner. The framework consists of an inference module that performs deductive reasoning to generate conclusions from premises, a reasoning controller that searches through the knowledge base to select premises for the next inference step, and a verifier module that checks the validity of each generated reasoning step. 

Specifically, the inference module is implemented using a PLM that is finetuned for deductive reasoning. At each step, the reasoning controller selects relevant facts and rules from the knowledge base as premises and passes them to the inference module, which then performs a deductive inference to generate a new conclusion. This conclusion can then be used as a premise for the next inference step. 

The key contribution is the addition of the verifier module, which is another finetuned PLM that scores the plausibility of each reasoning step to ensure it reflects valid deductive logic according to the model's beliefs. By combining deductive inference with explicit verification, the framework can iteratively conduct multi-step deductive reasoning while avoiding invalid reasoning chains.
