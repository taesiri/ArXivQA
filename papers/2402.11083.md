# [VQAttack: Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Visual Question Answering   via Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Investigates the adversarial robustness of Visual Question Answering (VQA) models trained with the prevalent "pre-training & fine-tuning" paradigm. 
- Transferable attacks across distinct models pose challenges due to differences in tasks, datasets, and model structures between pre-trained source and target VQA models.  
- Joint attacks on both image and text modalities are difficult due to continuous vs discrete representations.

Proposed Solution - VQAttack:
- Iteratively generates adversarial image and text perturbations using only the source pre-trained model.
- Includes an LLM-enhanced image attack module to optimize a masked answer anti-recovery loss.
- Triggers a cross-modal joint attack module at specific iterations to update image and text perturbations.
- Text updates utilize learned gradients and synonym substitutions in word embedding space.

Main Contributions:
- First study on adversarial vulnerability of VQA models under "pre-training & fine-tuning" paradigm.
- Proposes VQAttack method with novel modules for joint image and text perturbations.
- Utilizes LLM to generate masked text and enable attacks.
- Experiments on 2 datasets and 5 models validate effectiveness for transferable attacks.
- Reveals security blind spot in current VQA systems.

In summary, the paper performs a novel transferable attack between pre-trained source and target VQA models. The proposed VQAttack generates adversarial image-text pairs using innovative techniques for perturbation enhancement and cross-modal joint attacks. Experiments demonstrate serious vulnerabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes VQAttack, a novel method to generate transferable adversarial image-text pairs using pre-trained models to attack different victim visual question answering models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. This is the first study on the adversarial robustness of the VQA task under the "pre-training & fine-tuning" paradigm. It probes the potential security concern under a realistic scenario where attacks are generated from a pre-trained source model and transferred to unknown victim models.

2. It proposes VQAttack, a novel method to generate adversarial image-text pairs using pre-trained vision-language models. VQAttack has two key modules - the LLM-enhanced image attack module and the cross-modal joint attack module - to iteratively update perturbations on images and text.

3. Experiments conducted on two VQA datasets with five validated models demonstrate the effectiveness of VQAttack for transferable attacks, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art attack baselines. The results reveal a blind spot regarding robustness in the prevalent "pre-training & fine-tuning" learning paradigm on VQA tasks.

The paper focuses on investigating the adversarial vulnerability of VQA models trained under the prevalent "pre-training & fine-tuning" paradigm. It proposes a new attack model called VQAttack that can generate transferable adversarial image-text pairs using only a source pre-trained model to effectively attack different target VQA models. The key components of VQAttack include using LLMs to enhance image attacks and performing iterative cross-modal joint attacks on images and text. Overall, the key theme relates to assessing and improving the robustness of VQA systems to adversarial inputs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces two key challenges (C1 and C2) for the transferable adversarial attack problem. Can you elaborate on why addressing these two challenges is critical for generating effective attacks? 

2. The LLM-enhanced image attack module incorporates masked language modeling with an LLM to enhance image perturbations. What is the intuition behind using MLMs in this way, and how does it improve transferability?

3. The cross-modal joint attack module updates perturbations sequentially for images and text. Why is attacking both modalities simultaneously sub-optimal? What are the key differences in how perturbations are updated for each modality?

4. What motivated the design choice of only triggering text perturbations periodically instead of every iteration? What potential issues could arise from perturbing text too frequently?

5. The paper leverages latent gradients and word embeddings for text perturbation. How do these two components complement each other? What are their individual strengths and weaknesses?  

6. How does the proposed masked answer anti-recovery loss enhance transferability compared to only using latent feature distortions? What role does the ground truth answer play?

7. What modifications would be needed to extend the framework to other multimodal tasks beyond VQA, such as image captioning or multimodal translation?

8. The threat model assumes black-box access to victim models. How could white-box access change the attack methodology and potentially improve effectiveness?

9. The paper demonstrates impressive attack success rates across models. What defenses could potentially mitigate this vulnerability? Are there promising research directions?

10. What are the broader implications of the demonstrated vulnerability on the prevalence of "pre-training & fine-tuning" in vision-language research? How should the community address this?
