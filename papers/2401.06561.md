# [Intention Analysis Prompting Makes Large Language Models A Good   Jailbreak Defender](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06561)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-stage intention analysis prompting method to enhance the safety of large language models against jailbreak attacks during inference while maintaining helpfulness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces IAPrompt, a novel method that uses a two-stage process to identify user query intentions and generate safe, aligned responses from large language models (LLMs). 

2. IAPrompt functions at the inference stage and does not require further training of the LLM, thus providing an immediate, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM safety.

3. The method has been empirically validated to reduce harmfulness in LLM outputs to nearly 0%, across diverse models and attack methods, while preserving overall helpfulness.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating a simple yet highly effective strategy called IAPrompt to leverage LLMs' abilities to analyze intentions and ensure alignment, in order to defend against varying jailbreak attacks without compromising general helpfulness.

The paper introduces a new method called "Intention Analysis Prompting" (IAPrompt) to defend large language models against varying types of jailbreak attacks during inference, while maintaining model helpfulness. The key idea is to leverage LLMs' abilities to analyze intentions and self-correct through a two-stage prompting approach. Experiments showed IAPrompt significantly reduced attack success rates across models and datasets. So the core focus is on improving safety through intention analysis and self-correction, without additional model training. Key terms reflect this focus, as well as the variety of jailbreak attacks addressed and metrics used to measure performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Intention Analysis Prompting (IAPrompt) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a two-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism for intention analysis. Can you explain more about why explicitly separating the stages of intention analysis and policy-aligned response generation is important? Does consolidating them into a single stage impact performance?

2. How exactly does the intention analysis instruction guide the language model to identify safety, ethics and legality concerns in the user query? Does it simply tell the model to analyze for these or are there any specific techniques employed? 

3. The intention analysis stage avoids directly responding to the user query. What is the motivation behind this? Would allowing a direct response after analyzing intention undermine the safety objectives?

4. The paper shows the method is robust to different specific prompt expressions for intention analysis. Does this indicate the language model is analyzing intentions in an abstract, generalizable manner? Or is it sensitive to the way the analysis task is framed?

5. For the policy-aligned response stage, how does the method ensure strict adherence to safety standards? Does it rely on the model's own understanding of ethics or are additional constraints imposed?

6. The analysis shows that smaller 7B models are sufficiently capable for accurate intention analysis. Is there a lower bound below which performance starts degrading rapidly? 

7. How does the computational overhead of the two-stage approach compare to single-stage methods? Is there a efficiency vs safety tradeoff involved?

8. The confusion matrix analysis reveals high correlation between successful intention analysis and harmless response generation. Does this implicitly validate the model's understanding of ethics?

9. Can the intention analysis capability be isolated and employed for other interpretability objectives beyond safety, such as analyzing persuasiveness or creativity of prompts?

10. The human evaluation results showcase high agreement with model-based harm assessments when using GPT-3.5. Would this hold for other models too? How can calibration be ensured?
