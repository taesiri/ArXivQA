# [Self-Supervised Behavior Cloned Transformers are Path Crawlers for Text   Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04657)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-based games require agents to take sequential actions to accomplish goals, but generating supervised training data is expensive. 
- Reinforcement learning agents struggle to explore large action spaces effectively.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a self-supervised behavior cloning transformer that automatically generates its own training data by crawling trajectories (sequences of actions) in text games.
- Group trajectories into "path groups" based on similar macro-action sequences. Evaluate path groups by training small T5 models on them and testing on unseen game variations.
- Iteratively extend high-scoring path groups by further crawling until the full game is solved.

Contributions:
- Demonstrate generating self-supervised training data via crawling, grouping and evaluating game trajectories. 
- Use performance of rapidly-trained compact models on unseen games as a self-supervision signal.
- Develop methods to align and merge training data to reduce search space and training costs.

Results:
- Self-supervised transformer achieves ~90% performance of supervised transformer, significantly outperforms RL baseline, and is comparable to GPT-4 despite being much smaller.
- Identified self-supervised trajectories closely match human gold standard trajectories.
- Analysis provides insights into data efficiency, effect of training set noise, and limitations.

Overall, the paper presents a method to automatically generate training data for text game agents, reducing the need for expensive human annotations. The self-supervision approach enables small models to explore effectively and match the performance of much larger models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a self-supervised behavior cloning transformer for text games that automatically generates training data by exploring and evaluating trajectories that lead to reward.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating a method for generating self-supervised training data for behavior cloning transformer models applied to text games. Specifically, the paper shows how to:

1) Automatically crawl, group, and evaluate candidate paths (sequences of actions) that can serve as useful and generalizable training data for solving text games. 

2) Use the performance of small, rapidly trained models on unseen development games as a self-supervision signal to guide further path crawling and discover high-quality training data.  

3) Develop heuristic methods to align and merge training data from multiple path groups to reduce the task search space and training costs.

The paper validates this approach on three benchmark text games, showing the self-supervised model achieves about 90% of the performance of a supervised model trained on human demonstrations, without needing any labeled training data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a self-supervised behavior cloning transformer for text games. Can you elaborate on why text games are good benchmarks for evaluating multi-step reasoning and how the proposed method addresses key challenges?

2. The paper extracts game trajectories using a path crawler. What heuristics are used to limit the search space and make this tractable? How does the path crawler deal with large action spaces or sparse rewards?

3. Path groups are created by abstracting trajectories into parameterized macro-action sequences. What is the intuition behind this abstraction and how does it help assess path generalizability? Are there limitations to this approach?

4. Small T5 models are rapidly trained on path groups and evaluated on unseen development games. What is the rationale behind using model performance as a self-supervision signal? What are the tradeoffs?

5. Path crawling is performed incrementally up to the next reward signal. How does this segmentation help reduce the search space? When would this approach struggle?

6. The method merges high-performing path groups when no single group solves all variations. Can you elaborate on the specific procedure used and why naively combining groups performs poorly?

7. Figure 3 shows task performance increases linearly with more training examples. Why might certain games require more examples than others? How can this inform the practical use of this approach?

8. How robust is the path grouping compared to randomly sampled trajectories (Figure 4)? What explanations are provided and what may be other factors? 

9. The paper compares to DRRN and GPT-4 baselines. Can you analyze the limitations of these models and why the self-supervised transformer achieves stronger performance?

10. What are the broader limitations of this work? How may it generalize to more complex games or action spaces? What biases need to be considered when applying this approach more broadly?
