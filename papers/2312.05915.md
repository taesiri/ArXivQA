## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Diffusion for Natural Image Matting":

Problem:
Natural image matting aims to accurately extract foreground objects from images by estimating the alpha matte. Existing deep learning methods for this task focus heavily on utilizing contextual information but lack ability to capture fine details. Directly applying diffusion models can enhance texture details but faces challenges of high computational cost and inconsistent sampling between training and inference. 

Methods:
This paper proposes DiffMatte to effectively integrate diffusion models into matting. It has two main contributions:

1. Lightweight diffusion decoder: A separate lightweight decoder is designed to conduct diffusion iterations. This avoids repeatedly passing images through the heavy encoder network, reducing computational cost.

2. Self-aligned training strategy: A new strategy called self-aligned training with uniform time intervals is proposed. It replaces ground truth alpha with model's own predictions during training to mimic inference conditions. This aligns distributions over all time steps and maintains performance as steps increase.

DiffMatte can flexibly couple with different matting encoders like ResNet, Swin Transformers, ViT. It iteratively refines mattes focusing on texture details.

Results: 
Experiments show DiffMatte brings significant gains over baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art on Composition-1k benchmark. It also generalizes better to other datasets like Distinctions-646 and Semantic Image Matting. Qualitative results demonstrate it captures finer details than previous methods. Ablations validate the effectiveness of proposed strategies.

Conclusion:
The paper successfully migrates diffusion models to natural image matting and sets new performance records. The flexible diffusion framework can keep optimizing alpha mattes iteratively with marginal computation increase. Further exploration of interactive matting is promising future work.
