# [Provable Multi-Party Reinforcement Learning with Diverse Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods assume a single reward function can represent preferences of all users. However, users often have heterogeneous and conflicting preferences. Learning a single reward fails to capture diverse viewpoints and balance preferences across different individuals. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a multi-party RLHF framework to explicitly model rewards and preferences of multiple individuals using concepts from social choice theory. Key ideas:

1) Use meta-learning to efficiently learn individual reward functions by assuming they share an underlying low-dimensional representation. 

2) Aggregate multiple learned reward functions using social welfare functions like Nash, Utilitarian and Leximin to balance heterogeneous preferences. Nash bargaining is invariant to scaling of rewards and introduces "individual zeros" to avoid dominance.

3) Adopt a pessimistic estimation approach to construct lower confidence bounds on learned rewards. Maximize a pessimistic value function to obtain conservative policies that are provably close to optimal.

4) Provide theoretical guarantees on sample complexity and efficiency. Learned policies are approximately Pareto efficient and satisfy Pigou-Dalton transfer principle to promote fairness.

5) Extend framework to a reward-free setting using pessimistic variants of von Neumann winner based on preference distributions.


Main Contributions:

- Initiates theoretical study of multi-party RLHF with diverse human preferences
- Establishes fundamental limitations of single reward assumption 
- Proposes meta-learning based approach to efficiently learn multiple rewards
- Integrates social welfare functions like Nash bargaining for preference aggregation
- Provides sample complexity bounds and welfare guarantees for learned policies
- Generalizes to reward-free setting using von Neumann winner

The key insight is that explicitly modeling diversity is crucial for alignment, and tools from social choice can help balance conflicting preferences.
