# [Recursive Joint Simulation in Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper explores how the ability for AI agents to simulate each other changes strategic interactions between them. Specifically, it considers "recursive joint simulation", where agents can run a joint simulation of their interaction, including the possibility to recursively run nested simulations inside the simulation. A key assumption is that the agents cannot distinguish between being in a simulation versus reality. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper formally models recursive joint simulation games and shows they are strategically equivalent to infinitely repeated games with exponential discounting. This allows transferring existing folk theorem results about cooperation in repeated games. For example, in a recursive simulation of the Prisoner's Dilemma, agents can achieve mutual cooperation using a "grim trigger" strategy that starts out cooperating but defects forever if the opponent ever defects in any simulation level.

Main Contributions:

- Defines a formal model of "recursive joint simulation games", where agents jointly simulate their strategic interaction, including recursively nested sub-simulations

- Proves that these games are strategically equivalent to infinitely repeated games with discounting, allowing to inherit cooperative outcomes from folk theorems

- This opens the door to better cooperation between AI agents by leveraging the ability to accurately simulate them 

- Discusses extensions like voluntary simulation, variable simulation probability over time, limited simulation budget 

- Links the setting to philosophical questions of self-locating beliefs and indistinguishability between reality and simulation

In summary, the paper provides a rigorous analysis showing how recursive simulation between AI agents introduces new considerations but also enables more cooperative outcomes to be achieved in games like the Prisoner's Dilemma. The framework connects topics in AI safety and formal epistemology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper shows that a game between AI agents who have access to recursive joint simulation of themselves is strategically equivalent to an infinitely repeated version of the original game, inheriting properties like the folk theorem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is formally defining and analyzing a game model called "recursive joint simulation games". Specifically:

- The paper introduces the recursive joint simulation (RJS) game model, where AI agents have access to a device that can simulate interactions between the agents, including running nested simulations recursively. 

- It shows that RJS games with a fixed simulation probability at each level are strategically equivalent to infinitely repeated games with exponential discounting. This allows results like folk theorems for repeated games to be transferred to RJS games.

- The paper discusses several extensions and generalizations of the basic RJS game model, like making simulation voluntary, allowing the simulation probability to vary over levels, and limiting the simulation budget. It shows these variants have analogues in other types of repeated games.

- The relationship between beliefs an agent should have "from within" an RJS game and beliefs in repeated games is analyzed. With regular methods of belief updating, these beliefs correspond.

So in summary, the key contribution is formally introducing and analyzing this recursive joint simulation game model, establishing its connections to repeated games, and exploring its properties and variations. The hope is understanding interactions in this novel setting can eventually allow more cooperative outcomes between AI agents.

- Self-locating beliefs
- Program equilibrium

The paper explores the scenario where AI agents have access to joint simulation of the strategic situation they are facing, including the possibility of running nested simulations recursively. It shows the equivalence of this recursive joint simulation setup to discounted infinitely repeated games. This allows the authors to leverage existing results like folk theorems to characterize cooperative outcomes in the recursive simulation setting. The paper also discusses how agents should form beliefs about the depth of simulation when reasoning from within the recursive simulation scenario. Overall, the key ideas revolve around using simulation and recursion to facilitate cooperation between self-interested AI agents.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper establishes an equivalence between recursive joint simulation games and infinitely repeated games. However, infinitely repeated games allow for many undesirable equilibria, like extortionate outcomes. How might the framework be extended to rule out such extortionary equilibria in recursive joint simulation games?

2. The paper mostly focuses on recursive joint simulation enabling cooperative outcomes. But could the framework also enable better coordination in games like the stag hunt or battle of the sexes? What challenges might arise?

3. Proposition 4 shows an equivalence to finitely repeated games when there is a limited simulation budget. Could cryptographic tools like secure multi-party computation enable recursively jointly simulating without a strict budget limit? What are some research directions there?  

4. The paper does not deeply address agents having certainty about the simulation probability $p$. What if agents have differing subjective estimates of $p$? Could some agent benefit by pretending to have a different belief about $p$?

5. Do the results extend to recursive joint simulation between more than 2 agents? What additional complexities arise there both technically and game-theoretically?  

6. The paper focuses on recursive simulation of normal-form games. What about extending it to extensive-form games? Would imperfect or asymmetric information create issues?

7. Proposition 1 discusses self-locating beliefs. How sensitive are the results of this paper to the choice of technique for self-locating beliefs when reasoning from within a playthrough?  

8. Section 5 discusses some practical limitations around indistinguishability between simulation and reality. What are some research directions around formally characterizing classes of environments where indistinguishability seems feasible?

9. Could recursive joint simulation enable agents to learn to cooperate across many different games, rather than just a fixed game G? What are challenges there?

10. The paper leaves open what happens when simulation actions incur costs. Intuitively, costs should aid cooperation by deterring over-simulation. Can this intuition be formalized?
