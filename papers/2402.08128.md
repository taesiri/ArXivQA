# [Recursive Joint Simulation in Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper explores how the ability for AI agents to simulate each other changes strategic interactions between them. Specifically, it considers "recursive joint simulation", where agents can run a joint simulation of their interaction, including the possibility to recursively run nested simulations inside the simulation. A key assumption is that the agents cannot distinguish between being in a simulation versus reality. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper formally models recursive joint simulation games and shows they are strategically equivalent to infinitely repeated games with exponential discounting. This allows transferring existing folk theorem results about cooperation in repeated games. For example, in a recursive simulation of the Prisoner's Dilemma, agents can achieve mutual cooperation using a "grim trigger" strategy that starts out cooperating but defects forever if the opponent ever defects in any simulation level.

Main Contributions:

- Defines a formal model of "recursive joint simulation games", where agents jointly simulate their strategic interaction, including recursively nested sub-simulations

- Proves that these games are strategically equivalent to infinitely repeated games with discounting, allowing to inherit cooperative outcomes from folk theorems

- This opens the door to better cooperation between AI agents by leveraging the ability to accurately simulate them 

- Discusses extensions like voluntary simulation, variable simulation probability over time, limited simulation budget 

- Links the setting to philosophical questions of self-locating beliefs and indistinguishability between reality and simulation

In summary, the paper provides a rigorous analysis showing how recursive simulation between AI agents introduces new considerations but also enables more cooperative outcomes to be achieved in games like the Prisoner's Dilemma. The framework connects topics in AI safety and formal epistemology.
