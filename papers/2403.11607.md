# [AGRNav: Efficient and Energy-Saving Autonomous Navigation for Air-Ground   Robots in Occlusion-Prone Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11607)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous navigation for air-ground robots (AGRs) in complex environments with occlusions and unknown regions is challenging. Existing mapping-based methods cannot perceive obstacles in occluded areas, leading to higher collision risk and unnecessary aerial paths resulting in suboptimal energy consumption. Existing learning-based methods struggle to balance accuracy and inference speed - heavyweight networks are slow while lightweight networks lack contextual understanding.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose AGRNav, a novel framework for efficient and energy-saving navigation of AGRs. It contains two key components:

1) SCONet - A lightweight semantic scene completion network to accurately predict obstacle distribution and semantics in occluded regions. It uses depthwise separable convolutions for efficiency along with two self-attention mechanisms (Criss-Cross Attention and MobileViT Attention) to capture contextual information while remaining lightweight.

2) Hierarchical Path Planner - Utilizes a query-based method to achieve low-latency occupancy updates on the grid map based on predictions from SCONet. Subsequently searches energy-efficient aerial and ground paths on the updated map containing scanned and predicted obstacles.  

Main Contributions:

- Efficiency - 98% success rate in occlusion environments while being low-latency in updating predictions 

- Energy Savings - Unnecessary aerial paths reduced by 50% compared to baseline by predicting obstacles in advance

- Accuracy & Speed - SCONet enables real-time (20 FPS) and accurate (IoU 56.12) scene completion, outperforming state-of-the-art on SemanticKITTI benchmark

The system is validated in simulated environments and complex real-world scenarios with a custom AGR platform, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.
