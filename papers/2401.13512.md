# [Can GPT-3.5 Generate and Code Discharge Summaries?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13512)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical document coding (assigning diagnosis codes from medical ontologies like ICD-10) is important but labor intensive. Automated coding with machine learning is challenging due to data sparsity for rare codes.  
- Recent large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 have potential for generating synthetic patient data to augment rare labels, but their capabilities need validation.

Methods:
- Used GPT-3.5 to generate 9,606 synthetic discharge summaries for 114 rare ICD-10 codes in MIMIC-IV, based on label descriptions.  
- Augmented the MIMIC-IV training set with the synthetic summaries and trained neural coding models (CAML, LAAT, Multi-Res CNN) on baseline vs augmented data.
- Evaluated model performance on full test set, generation codes, and code families using micro/macro F1 scores and hierarchical metrics. 
- Tested GPT-3.5's own ability to code real and synthetic discharge summaries.
- Had clinicians evaluate correctness, informativeness and authenticity of generated summaries.

Results:
- Augmentation improved macro F1 and family-level metrics but decreased overall micro F1. Reduced out-of-family errors for generation codes.  
- GPT-3.5 showed mediocre coding ability for real summaries, decent for synthetic.  
- Generated summaries were reasonably correct but lacked coherence, support information and authenticity.  

Conclusions:
- Augmentation benefits rare label families but real examples still crucial. GPT-3.5 alone unsuitable for coding real summaries.  
- Generated summaries state prompted concepts adequately but lack variety, support information and clinical validity in narratives.
- Future work could explore retrieval-augmented generation or chronological prompting for more realistic synthetic summaries.

The key contributions are:
1) A methodology using GPT-3.5 to generate synthetic discharge summaries for augmenting rare ICD-10 codes.
2) Quantitative analysis demonstrating improvements in rare code prediction from augmentation.
3) Insights into limitations of LLMs for coding real summaries and generating coherent clinical narratives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

GPT-3.5 can generate clinically correct but incoherent and unnatural discharge summaries from label prompts and partially code diagnoses when provided explicit in-text descriptions, but performs poorly on unaided coding of real clinical notes and is unsuitable for clinical deployment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Investigating the ability of GPT-3.5 to generate and code medical discharge summaries for augmenting training data of local neural models, especially for rare/low-resource labels. 

2) Assessing GPT-3.5's performance in automatically coding diagnoses in real clinical notes from MIMIC-IV as well as synthetic notes it generated.

3) Evaluating the clinical acceptability of GPT-3.5 generated discharge summaries by having clinical experts review and rate them on dimensions like correctness, informativeness, authenticity and overall acceptability. 

In summary, the paper explores using GPT-3.5 for both automated medical coding and synthetic clinical text generation to address data sparsity issues, tests its coding ability, and evaluates the clinical credibility of the generated text - which are novel contributions around leveraging large language models in this application area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this work are:

ICD Coding, Data Augmentation, Large Language Model, Clinical Text Generation, Evaluation by Clinicians, GPT-3.5, MIMIC-IV, Automated Medical Coding, Synthetic Data Generation, Low-Resource Labels, Hierarchical Evaluation, Clinical Note Generation

The paper explores using the large language model GPT-3.5 for automated ICD coding of medical documents, specifically through generating synthetic discharge summaries to augment training data for neural network models, especially for low-resource labels. It evaluates GPT-3.5's ability to generate clinically acceptable discharge summaries as well as perform ICD coding itself. The evaluation involves hierarchy-aware metrics as well as reviews by clinical professionals. The key terms reflect this focus on using large language models to synthesize medical text for augmenting automated medical coding systems and evaluation techniques tailored for these hierarchical label spaces.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors used GPT-3.5 to generate discharge summaries. What are some key advantages and limitations of using GPT-3.5 versus other language models for this task? How might the choice of model impact the quality and usefulness of the generated summaries?

2. The authors selected a specific subset of codes from MIMIC-IV to generate summaries for. What was the rationale behind choosing this subset? How might changing the selection criteria impact the model's ability to generate useful synthetic summaries? 

3. The authors specified several requirements in the prompt to guide the generation, such as length, inclusion of social/family history, anonymization etc. Why were these specifications important? How might modifying them change how well the model performs?

4. The authors evaluated model performance using both standard and hierarchical evaluation metrics. What are the benefits of using hierarchical methods like CoPHE for this task? What key insights do they provide that simpler metrics may miss?

5. The clinical evaluation highlighted several shortcomings in the generated summaries, such as lack of coherence and authenticity. What techniques could help address these issues? How can we better guide or constrain models to produce more realistic narratives?  

6. While augmentation improved performance on low-resource codes, zero-shot performance was inconsistent. What factors may have contributed to this? How can zero-shot performance be improved in future work?

7. GPT-3.5 struggled with coding real discharge summaries. Why do you think directing the model with explicit code descriptions worked better? What are the key challenges in getting models to reliably code real clinical text?

8. What role could retrieval-augmented generation play in improving synthetic summary quality? What benefits and challenges exist with incorporating retrieved examples?

9. The authors suggest restructuring prompts to present diagnoses chronologically. Do you think this could enhance coherence and authenticity? What other prompt structuring ideas may help?

10. What other evaluation methods beyond clinician review could provide insight into the quality and usefulness of generated summaries for augmentation? Are there any quantitative metrics that may correlate with acceptability?
