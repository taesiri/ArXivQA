# [BESA: Pruning Large Language Models with Blockwise Parameter-Efficient   Sparsity Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16880)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA have demonstrated impressive performance on various natural language tasks. However, their vast number of parameters leads to high memory usage and slow inference speed, making deployment difficult. Prior LLM pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda operate layer-wise, minimizing the pruning error per layer. This causes rapid error accumulation and requires meticulous tuning of layer-wise pruning rates.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel LLM pruning technique called Blockwise Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Allocation (BESA). In contrast to prior layer-wise approaches, BESA has two key features:

1) It minimizes the overall pruning error with respect to transformer blocks rather than individual layers. This reduces error accumulation.

2) It allocates layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner allowing joint optimization of all layer pruning rates. This avoids meticulous tuning.  

BESA represents pruning masks using a small set of learnable parameters. The pruning probability for weights is modeled such that less important weights have higher probability of being pruned. This reduces the optimization difficulty. BESA can be jointly optimized with weight quantization in a differentiable manner.

Contributions:
1) Proposes BESA, the first differentiable pruning algorithm for LLMs that optimizes layer-wise pruning rates.

2) BESA is parameter-efficient, enabling efficient compression of LLMs with up to 180B parameters on a single A100 GPU.

3) Experiments on LLAMAS show BESA achieves state-of-the-art results, pruning up to 50% of LLaMA2-70B in 5 hours on A100 with only 0.16 higher perplexity on WikiText2 over SparseGPT.

4) Simulations using ViTCoD accelerator demonstrate the potential for speeding up sparse matrix multiplications in the pruned LLMs by up to 1.98x.

In summary, BESA enables efficient automated pruning of massive LLMs by minimizing block-wise error and differentiably learning optimal layer-wise sparsity. Experiments validate the state-of-the-art results and acceleration potential.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel large language model pruning technique called BESA that minimizes block-wise reconstruction error and dynamically allocates layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner to efficiently compress models with reduced performance degradation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel LLM pruning technique called blockwise parameter-efficient sparsity allocation (BESA). BESA has two key advantages:

1) It targets the overall pruning error with respect to individual transformer blocks, rather than minimizing the pruning error layer-by-layer. This reduces the accumulation of errors across layers. 

2) It allocates layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner, allowing the layer-wise pruning rates to be optimized using gradient descent. This ensures reduced performance degradation after pruning.

In summary, BESA is the first differentiable pruning algorithm for LLMs that operates on transformer blocks and learns optimal per-layer sparsity rates. Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art performance in pruning large models like LLaMA1 and LLaMA2.
