# [Switchable Representation Learning Framework with Self-compatibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08289)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

How can we learn feature representations from multiple models with different capacities such that the features are compatible/aligned, allowing the models to collaborate effectively for visual search tasks across platforms with varying resource constraints? 

The key hypothesis appears to be that by resolving conflicts between sub-models during joint training, in terms of both gradient magnitude and direction, it is possible to achieve effective feature alignment and compatibility among a series of models with different capacities.

In summary, the paper proposes a method called Switchable Representation Learning Framework with Self-Compatibility (SFSC) to address the need for feature compatibility across models with varying capacities, in order to enable effective model deployment and collaboration across platforms with diverse resource limitations.
