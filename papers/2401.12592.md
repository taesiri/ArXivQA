# [RGBD Objects in the Wild: Scaling Real-World 3D Object Learning from   RGB-D Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing real-world 3D object datasets only provide RGB data, lacking depth information. This limits their use for tasks like novel view synthesis, 3D reconstruction, etc. 
- Existing RGB-D object datasets are limited in scale and diversity - they have few objects/categories, clean backgrounds or cover limited views.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper collects a large-scale RGB-D video dataset called WildRGB-D with real-world tabletop objects.
- It has around 8,500 objects across 46 categories captured in 20K videos using iPhones to go around objects in 360 degrees.
- Videos have 3 setups - single object, multi-object and object with static hand to cover common real-world scenarios.
- The dataset has object masks, camera poses, and point clouds automatically annotated using state-of-the-art methods.

Main Contributions:
- WildRGB-D is the largest real-world RGB-D object-centric video dataset with diverse cluttered background and occlusion.
- It provides high quality annotations to enable tasks like novel view synthesis, reconstruction, pose estimation etc.
- Benchmarking of various algorithms is done on 4 tracks - single scene novel view synthesis, generalizable view synthesis, camera pose estimation and 6D object pose estimation. 
- Experiments show RGB-D data and large scale help advance state-of-the-art in these areas.
- The dataset has potential to further progress in RGB-D based 3D object understanding.

In summary, the paper collects a large-scale and diverse RGB-D object dataset with applications in multiple 3D understanding tasks, where it shows promising benchmarking results.

The paper introduces a new large-scale RGB-D object dataset called WildRGB-D containing around 8,500 objects and 20,000 videos across 46 categories, annotated with masks, camera poses and point clouds, and benchmarks performance on tasks like novel view synthesis, pose estimation, and reconstruction to demonstrate its potential to advance 3D object learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new large-scale RGB-D object dataset called WildRGB-D. Specifically:

- WildRGB-D contains around 8,500 recorded objects and nearly 20,000 RGB-D videos across 46 common object categories. The videos capture 360 degree views of the objects.

- The videos come in three types: single object, multi-object, and hand-object. This covers diverse real-world scenarios.

- The dataset has sensor-based depth information, allowing for better 3D annotations and downstream applications compared to RGB-only datasets. 

- It is annotated with object masks, real-world scale camera poses, and reconstructed point clouds from the RGB-D data.

- The paper benchmarks performance on tasks like novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, object reconstruction, and 6D pose estimation. This demonstrates the potential of the dataset to advance 3D object learning.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and benchmarking of a large-scale, sensor-captured RGB-D object dataset with rich annotations to facilitate future research in 3D deep learning for objects.
