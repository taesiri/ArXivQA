# [FusionSF: Fuse Heterogeneous Modalities in a Vector Quantized Framework   for Robust Solar Power Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05823)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate solar power forecasting is critical for integrating solar plants into the electric grid, but faces challenges due to reliance on weather conditions and lack of historical data for new plants. Current methods rely mainly on historical solar power data or numerical weather predictions in single modalities, lacking fusion of complementary multi-modal information.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FusionSF, a multi-modality fusion framework, to integrate historical power data, numerical weather predictions (NWP), and satellite images for robust solar forecasting. The key aspects are:

1) Vector Quantization (VQ) framework that aligns modalities and reduces noise. VQ layers help normalize distributions for better fusion and denoise signals.

2) Strong zero-shot forecasting capability by leveraging data from multiple plants, allowing new plants with limited historical data to still achieve accurate predictions. 

3) Transformer-based architecture with temporal modules to process time series data and vision modules to process satellite images. Cross attention fuses the modalities.

4) Multi-Modal Solar Power (MMSP) dataset with solar power, satellite, and NWP data collected from 88 plants over 1.5 years released to promote research.

Main Contributions:

1) FusionSF outperforms SOTA models by 30.6% and deployed baseline by 9.5%, showing the value of multi-modality fusion.

2) In-depth analysis of VQ layers shows they align distributions and reduce noise for better fusion.

3) Zero-shot experiments demonstrate potential for new plants with limited data. Multi-modality provides robustness single modalities lack.  

4) Analysis shows fusion is still beneficial even with highly accurate NWP data, highlighting need for complementary modalities.

5) Real-world deployment on 300+ plants validating effectiveness. MMSP dataset enabling further research.

In summary, the paper presents a Transformer-based multi-modality fusion approach using VQ to integrate complementary data sources for advancing solar forecasting accuracy and zero-shot capabilities.
