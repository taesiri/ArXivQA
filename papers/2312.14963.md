# [Optimizing Mario Adventures in a Constrained Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of optimizing gameplay strategies for Super Mario Bros (SMB) in a constrained environment. The goal is to develop Mario agents that can efficiently collect coins, traverse long distances, and complete levels within minimal time while adhering to constraints on gameplay duration, number of lives, etc. This is a complex constrained optimization problem suitable for evolutionary algorithms.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes and compares two approaches - Mario Genetic Algorithm (MarioGA) and Mario NeuroEvolution (MarioNE). 

MarioGA: Uses a genetic algorithm to evolve sequences of actions (genotypes) that determine Mario's gameplay behavior (phenotype). The fitness function rewards coin collection, distance traveled and penalizes time taken, guiding evolution. Tournament selection, one-point crossover and random mutation are used to evolve the population over generations.

MarioNE: Employs NEAT algorithm to optimize neural network controllers for Mario. Networks take game state as input and determine actions. Fitness evaluation is similar to MarioGA. NEAT evolves network weights and topology over generations through selection, crossover and mutation to enhance gameplay.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of Super Mario Bros gameplay optimization as a constrained problem with clear objectives related to coins, distance and time.

- Implementation and detailed analysis of a genetic algorithm (MarioGA) and neuroevolution approach (MarioNE) for this problem.

- Extensive empirical evaluation over multiple levels and folds comparing performance of the two proposed methods. MarioGA converged faster and achieved 94% level completion rate compared to 8% for MarioNE.

- Investigation into dynamics of local optima, effects of tuning fitness function, runtime performance, etc. 

- The work provides a robust platform for further research into optimizing game-playing agents under constraints using evolutionary and neural approaches.

In summary, the paper proposes and thoroughly evaluates two methods for constrained optimization of Super Mario Bros gameplay, making several contributions around formulation, implementation and analysis. The genetic algorithm approach outperforms neuroevolution and provides a strong foundation for future work.
