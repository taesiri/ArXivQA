# [GaussianAvatar: Towards Realistic Human Avatar Modeling from a Single   Video via Animatable 3D Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02134)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in this paper:

GaussianAvatar introduces a novel animatable 3D Gaussian representation to model highly-realistic human avatars from a single video. Compared to implicit neural radiance fields or explicit mesh/point-based methods, the proposed 3D Gaussians can efficiently represent detailed human surfaces while supporting flexible topology and real-time rendering. They augment the Gaussians with dynamic pose-dependent properties, predicted by a dynamic appearance network conditioned on a UV positional map of the underlying SMPL model. To capture coarse global appearance and reduce overfitting to the limited training poses, they also optimize an appearance feature tensor in an end-to-end manner. 

Additionally, leveraging the differentiable nature of the animatable Gaussians, they propose joint optimization of the avatar appearance and estimated body motions from the input video. This helps refine inaccurate motions and improves modeling of cloth wrinkles and deformations. Evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate superior novel view synthesis, ability to handle complex poses, and realism of rendered avatars compared to state-of-the-art monocular human reconstruction techniques. The proposed representation and joint optimization strategy effectively addresses key challenges in creating animatable avatars from monocular inputs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 GaussianAvatar introduces animatable 3D Gaussians augmented with dynamic properties to model realistic human avatars from monocular videos, enabling joint optimization of motion and appearance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing animatable 3D Gaussians for realistic human avatar modeling from a single video. The explicit 3D Gaussian representation can fuse appearances more efficiently and consistently from 2D observations.

2. Augmenting the animatable 3D Gaussians with dynamic properties to support pose-dependent appearance modeling. A dynamic appearance network and optimizable feature tensor are designed to learn the motion-to-appearance mapping. 

3. Proposing to jointly optimize the motion and appearance during avatar modeling. This enables correcting misalignments in initial motion estimates and improving the final appearance quality.

In summary, the main contribution is using an animatable 3D Gaussian representation along with joint motion and appearance optimization to achieve high-quality avatar reconstruction from a single monocular video. The method demonstrates improved efficiency, consistency, and accuracy compared to previous implicit volume or mesh-based approaches.
