# [GaussianAvatar: Towards Realistic Human Avatar Modeling from a Single   Video via Animatable 3D Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02134)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in this paper:

GaussianAvatar introduces a novel animatable 3D Gaussian representation to model highly-realistic human avatars from a single video. Compared to implicit neural radiance fields or explicit mesh/point-based methods, the proposed 3D Gaussians can efficiently represent detailed human surfaces while supporting flexible topology and real-time rendering. They augment the Gaussians with dynamic pose-dependent properties, predicted by a dynamic appearance network conditioned on a UV positional map of the underlying SMPL model. To capture coarse global appearance and reduce overfitting to the limited training poses, they also optimize an appearance feature tensor in an end-to-end manner. 

Additionally, leveraging the differentiable nature of the animatable Gaussians, they propose joint optimization of the avatar appearance and estimated body motions from the input video. This helps refine inaccurate motions and improves modeling of cloth wrinkles and deformations. Evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate superior novel view synthesis, ability to handle complex poses, and realism of rendered avatars compared to state-of-the-art monocular human reconstruction techniques. The proposed representation and joint optimization strategy effectively addresses key challenges in creating animatable avatars from monocular inputs.
