# [ImFace++: A Sophisticated Nonlinear 3D Morphable Face Model with   Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04028)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents ImFace++, a novel 3D morphable face model based on implicit neural representations (INRs) that captures intricate facial shape variations and high-frequency details. The model employs disentangled deformation fields to explicitly model complex deformations related to identities and expressions. It establishes dense correspondence across different individuals by deforming them to a shared template space. To capture subtle personalized details like wrinkles and pores, ImFace++ incorporates a refinement displacement field tailored to the dynamic nature of human faces by encoding details in the stable template space using correspondences. Additionally, a Neural Blend Field is introduced to decompose the learning into semantic subregions for enhanced detail modeling. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in face reconstruction and correspondence modeling. Both qualitative and quantitative results showcase ImFace++'s exceptional ability to represent fine-grained nonlinear deformations and high-frequency geometric nuances. The compact disentangled latent space also enables intuitive editing of expression and identity attributes. Overall, ImFace++ significantly advances 3D face modeling using innovations in implicit neural representations.
