# [ControlVideo: Adding Conditional Control for One Shot Text-to-Video   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17098)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/goals of this paper are:1. How can we enhance the fidelity and temporal consistency of text-driven video editing, such that the edited videos faithfully preserve the content of the source video and maintain coherence between frames?2. How can text-to-image diffusion models and control methods be adapted for faithful and consistent one-shot text-driven video editing?3. What architectural modifications and fine-tuning strategies are most effective at improving faithfulness and consistency when tuning a video diffusion model on a single source video-text pair?Specifically, the paper aims to develop a novel approach called ControlVideo that incorporates additional visual control signals, transforms spatial self-attention to key-frame attention, and adds temporal attention modules to guide a pretrained diffusion model to generate videos that align with target text prompts while remaining faithful to the source video and temporally consistent. The key hypotheses are:- Incorporating visual control signals like edge maps will enhance faithfulness by providing stronger guidance from the source video structure.- Aligning all frames to a key frame via transformed self-attention will improve temporal consistency. - Adding temporal attention initialized from spatial self-attention weights will further boost faithfulness and consistency.- Carefully designed fine-tuning strategies for the attention modules can prevent overfitting during tuning on a single video-text pair.The paper includes ablation studies and comparisons to analyze the individual and combined effects of ControlVideo's components and demonstrate its capabilities for text-driven video editing.
