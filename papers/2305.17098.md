# [ControlVideo: Adding Conditional Control for One Shot Text-to-Video   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17098)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/goals of this paper are:1. How can we enhance the fidelity and temporal consistency of text-driven video editing, such that the edited videos faithfully preserve the content of the source video and maintain coherence between frames?2. How can text-to-image diffusion models and control methods be adapted for faithful and consistent one-shot text-driven video editing?3. What architectural modifications and fine-tuning strategies are most effective at improving faithfulness and consistency when tuning a video diffusion model on a single source video-text pair?Specifically, the paper aims to develop a novel approach called ControlVideo that incorporates additional visual control signals, transforms spatial self-attention to key-frame attention, and adds temporal attention modules to guide a pretrained diffusion model to generate videos that align with target text prompts while remaining faithful to the source video and temporally consistent. The key hypotheses are:- Incorporating visual control signals like edge maps will enhance faithfulness by providing stronger guidance from the source video structure.- Aligning all frames to a key frame via transformed self-attention will improve temporal consistency. - Adding temporal attention initialized from spatial self-attention weights will further boost faithfulness and consistency.- Carefully designed fine-tuning strategies for the attention modules can prevent overfitting during tuning on a single video-text pair.The paper includes ablation studies and comparisons to analyze the individual and combined effects of ControlVideo's components and demonstrate its capabilities for text-driven video editing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting ControlVideo, a novel approach for faithful and consistent text-driven video editing. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. ControlVideo incorporates additional visual conditions such as edge maps and depth maps through ControlNet to provide structure guidance from the source video. This helps enhance the faithfulness of the edited video.2. ControlVideo transforms the spatial self-attention in diffusion models into key-frame attention, which aligns all frames to a selected key frame. This improves temporal consistency. 3. ControlVideo carefully incorporates temporal attention modules in the diffusion model using pre-trained spatial self-attention weights as initialization. This further enhances faithfulness and temporal consistency.4. The paper conducts a systematic empirical study to analyze the optimal design choices for the key components of ControlVideo - the attention mechanisms and control guidance. This provides useful insights to inform future research into optimizing video diffusion backbones for one-shot tuning tasks.5. Extensive experiments demonstrate ControlVideo substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for text-driven video editing in terms of faithfulness and consistency while aligning well with the target text prompt. It also shows appealing ability to generate videos with high visual realism and fidelity.Overall, by carefully designing control guidance and attention modules, ControlVideo presents an effective approach to enhance faithfulness and consistency for text-driven one-shot video editing based on diffusion models. The empirical study also provides useful design guidelines.
