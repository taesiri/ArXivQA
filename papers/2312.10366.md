# [Fusing Conditional Submodular GAN and Programmatic Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
Programmatic weak supervision (PWS) methods generate noisy pseudo labels to train models without manual labeling. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can generate synthetic images to augment limited datasets. However, training conditional GANs requires accurate class labels. Recently, WSGAN proposed combining PWS with InfoGAN to simultaneously train a label model and generate class-conditional images. However, InfoGAN's disentangled representations may not be class-specific, hurting the label model's accuracy. Also, noisy pseudo labels can make GAN training unstable. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes fusing a conditional GAN with an encoder-based PWS label model using a noise-aware weakly supervised classifier. To handle noisy pseudo labels, the classifier uses a symmetric cross-entropy loss and is trained adaptively as the label model improves. 

Additionally, a subset selection method based on submodular maximization with a knapsack constraint is proposed to select the most representative and diverse examples with minimal label uncertainty for classifier training. This formulation helps reduce noise and improves results.

The conditional GAN uses the classifier's predictions to generate class-conditional images. The classifier and label model are iteratively refined using each other's outputs in an adaptive fashion. Subset selection further helps improve image quality and label accuracy.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes a technique to fuse a conditional GAN with an encoder-based PWS label model using a noise-aware weakly supervised classifier
2) Presents a subset selection approach for PWS by identifying the most diverse and representative examples via submodular maximization, reducing uncertainty  
3) Investigates the impact of subset selection on the label model performance and quality of generated images

The method shows improved image quality, label model accuracy and data augmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques like WSGAN. The subset selection is shown to further boost performance on several tasks and datasets.
