# [Acceptance and Trust: Drivers' First Contact with Released Automated   Vehicles in Naturalistic Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Studies on acceptance and trust of automated driving systems have largely been conducted in simulated environments. Real-world validation with actual automated driving systems is lacking.  
- The launch of Mercedes-Benz's Drive Pilot, the first approved Level 3 automated driving system (ADS) in Germany, provides a new opportunity to study human interactions with ADS in everyday use.

Objective:
- Evaluate how first-hand experience with the Level 3 Drive Pilot system affects drivers' acceptance, trust, usability ratings and user experience. 

Methodology: 
- 30 participants with no prior experience with Level 3 systems took test drives in a Mercedes-Benz EQS vehicle equipped with Drive Pilot on a German highway.
- Questionnaires measured acceptance, trust, usability and user experience before and after experiencing the system.
- A post-drive interview captured additional qualitative feedback.

Key Findings:
- Acceptance and trust in the ADS significantly increased after experiencing the system in real-world conditions. Factors like performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and intention to use improved.
- The system was rated highly on usability and user experience, especially for attractiveness and dependability.
- Communication gaps were noticed when the system deactivated itself without clear reasons. Mode confusion with lower automation levels poses hazards.
- No significant impact of general affinity for technology on acceptance/trust was found, likely due to mostly tech-savvy participants.

Major Contributions:
- Confirms findings from simulated ADS studies regarding acceptance and trust improvements after first-hand experience.
- Validates that unclear system behaviors don't negatively impact acceptance or trust. 
- Reveals communication issues as an area for improvement to prevent misuse or confusion.
- Highlights need for more diverse participant samples, including low-tech affinity groups.

In summary, this pioneering real-world study largely aligns with and validates prior simulator research, while also identifying communication and mode confusion challenges to guide future development.
