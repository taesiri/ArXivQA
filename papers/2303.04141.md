# [Toward Defining a Domain Complexity Measure Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI systems developed in simulated/closed environments struggle when transitioned to open-world real-world domains due to increased complexity and out-of-distribution data. 
- There is a need for quantitative, domain-independent measures of complexity to predict the difficulty posed to AI systems when transitioning between domains or facing novelty.

Proposed Solution:
- Define a framework to estimate domain complexity levels in a domain-independent way, distinguishing between intrinsic (environment) complexity and extrinsic (agent-dependent) complexity.
- Intrinsic complexity comprises the environment space (objects, agents, relationships etc) and task solution space (possible paths to solve task).
- Extrinsic complexity comprises agent performance, goals, planning and skills spaces.  
- Complexity can be measured along dimensions like dimensionality, sparsity, heterogeneity. 
- Use state transition graphs to represent planning domains and feature spaces for perception domains.

Main Contributions:
- Identification of key components that make up domain complexity.
- Distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic complexity.
- Domain-independent framework to estimate complexity levels across diverse domains.
- Discussion of key complexity measures like dimensionality, sparsity, heterogeneity.
- State transition graphs and feature spaces as standard representations.
- Basis to predict difficulty of novelty detection and accommodation when transitioning across domains.

In summary, the paper proposes a systematic domain-independent framework to quantify the complexity levels of different domains which can serve as a basis to predict the difficulty AI systems will face when transitioning from simple to more open-world complex domains.
