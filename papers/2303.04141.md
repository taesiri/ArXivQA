# [Toward Defining a Domain Complexity Measure Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI systems developed in simulated/closed environments struggle when transitioned to open-world real-world domains due to increased complexity and out-of-distribution data. 
- There is a need for quantitative, domain-independent measures of complexity to predict the difficulty posed to AI systems when transitioning between domains or facing novelty.

Proposed Solution:
- Define a framework to estimate domain complexity levels in a domain-independent way, distinguishing between intrinsic (environment) complexity and extrinsic (agent-dependent) complexity.
- Intrinsic complexity comprises the environment space (objects, agents, relationships etc) and task solution space (possible paths to solve task).
- Extrinsic complexity comprises agent performance, goals, planning and skills spaces.  
- Complexity can be measured along dimensions like dimensionality, sparsity, heterogeneity. 
- Use state transition graphs to represent planning domains and feature spaces for perception domains.

Main Contributions:
- Identification of key components that make up domain complexity.
- Distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic complexity.
- Domain-independent framework to estimate complexity levels across diverse domains.
- Discussion of key complexity measures like dimensionality, sparsity, heterogeneity.
- State transition graphs and feature spaces as standard representations.
- Basis to predict difficulty of novelty detection and accommodation when transitioning across domains.

In summary, the paper proposes a systematic domain-independent framework to quantify the complexity levels of different domains which can serve as a basis to predict the difficulty AI systems will face when transitioning from simple to more open-world complex domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for estimating domain complexity levels in a domain-independent way by distinguishing between intrinsic, agent-independent complexity and extrinsic, agent-dependent complexity across multiple component spaces including environment, task solution, performance, goals, planning, and skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework for defining the components to consider when estimating a domain's complexity level in a domain-independent way. The key ideas are:

1) Distinguishing between intrinsic (agent-independent) and extrinsic (agent-dependent) complexity. 

2) Organizing the components that impact complexity into different "spaces" - environment space, task solution space, performance space, goal space, planning space, and skills space. 

3) Providing both classical AI and data science perspectives on representing domains and measuring complexity using concepts like state transition graphs, feature spaces, dimensionality, sparsity, and heterogeneity.

4) Arguing that having standardized methods for characterizing domain complexity can help predict the difficulty of transitioning AI systems between different environments and enable robustness when facing novelty.

5) Outlining future research directions related to connecting complexity and difficulty, applying the complexity measures to complex systems, and distinguishing complexity for infinite state/action spaces.

In summary, the main contribution is a proposed common framework for estimating domain complexity levels in a domain-independent way to support AI development and transfer across diverse tasks and environments.

The paper proposes a framework for defining domain complexity in a domain-independent way, distinguishing between intrinsic complexity that is inherent to the domain itself, and extrinsic complexity that depends on the agent and task. Different "spaces" are identified that characterize different aspects of complexity. The paper also discusses representations like state transition graphs and feature spaces that can be used to quantify complexity, along with measures like dimensionality, sparsity, and heterogeneity. The motivation is to help predict the difficulty of open-world learning tasks like detecting and responding to novelty when transitioning agents between domains.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the methods proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes representing domain complexity using state transition graphs and feature spaces. What are some limitations of using these representations to capture all aspects of a domain's complexity? Could there be important complexity factors that are not well characterized by these tools?

2) Section 5 lists many components that contribute to domain complexity, divided into environment space, task solution space, performance space, etc. Is the division of components into these categories optimal? Could some complexity factors span multiple spaces? How would you validate the completeness of this framework?

3) Heterogeneity is proposed as a driver of complexity. However, heterogeneity could emerge in many forms across the spaces listed in Section 5. What specific types of heterogeneity in each space are most important? How would you measure heterogeneity in a rigorous way? 

4) The paper claims domain-independent complexity measures are necessary. However, task performance depends greatly on the match between agent capabilities and domain requirements. Could agent-specific complexity measures be more insightful? How would you design experiments to compare these two approaches?

5) Sparsity and dimensionality are proposed as key complexity drivers. However, are high dimensionality and sparsity always negative factors? Could they simplify problems in some cases? How would you determine optimal values along these dimensions?

6) Section 6 proposes complexity can be measured using minimal agent complexity to achieve set performance thresholds. This is an extrinsic approach. How well could intrinsic measures alone predict difficulty? How would you design experiments to compare intrinsic versus extrinsic approaches? 

7) The framework integrates novelty hierarchy levels like objects and relations as complexity components. However, novelty can emerge in other forms not listed. How would you expand the framework to account for all possible novelty types? How could the expanded set be validated?

8) The paper claims transitioning agents between domains is challenging when complexity changes. However, agents can adapt. Under what conditions could agents quickly adapt to more complex target domains? How would you measure adaptability? 

9) Domain complexity levels are proposed to be useful for predicting transfer difficulty. However, task and agent details also impact transfer. What experiments could rigorously test the predictive power of complexity alone? What factors would need to be controlled?

10) Overall, few concrete algorithms are proposed for measuring complexity components. What specific mathematical frameworks or models would you propose to quantify the key complexity factors identified? How would you validate the accuracy of measurements?
