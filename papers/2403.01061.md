# [Reading Subtext: Evaluating Large Language Models on Short Story   Summarization with Writers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01061)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can summarize long, nuanced narrative text is challenging because most narratives are either in the public domain (and in LLM training data) or copyrighted. Additionally, holistically evaluating summary quality is difficult without reliable automatic metrics or expensive human evaluation. 

Solution: The authors work directly with 9 experienced creative writers to obtain 25 unpublished short stories up to 10,000 tokens long. They generate summaries with GPT-4, Claude-2.1, and Llama-2-70B, and have the writers evaluate the summaries of their own stories on coherence, faithfulness, coverage, and analysis.

Key Findings:
- All 3 models make faithfulness mistakes in over 50% of summaries and struggle with difficult subtext 
- At their best, the models provide thoughtful thematic analysis 
- Most common faithfulness errors are in interpreting character feelings and reactions
- Unreliable narrators are challenging for the models
- GPT-4 and Claude summarize short and long stories equally well
- LLM judgments of summary quality do not match writer judgments

Contributions:
1) A methodology for evaluating LLMs on unseen data using writers as partners
2) Informed ratings showing even best models make errors in ~50% of summaries 
3) Analysis grounded in narrative theory revealing struggles with subtext

The paper demonstrates LLMs can understand long narrative but reliable interpretation, especially of feelings, remains a key challenge. Collaborating with writers ensures evaluation on unseen data and informed human judgments of quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates large language models on summarizing unseen short stories from writers and finds strengths in thematic analysis but remaining challenges in reliably interpreting subtext and narrative voice.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A characterization of LLM narrative understanding based on narrative theory, resulting in directions for future research. 

2. A methodology for evaluating LLM summaries when the lines between test and training data have blurred, as well as a demonstration that LLM judgments cannot replace skilled human evaluators for this task.

3. Informed ratings of faithfulness and the interpretive quality of LLM summaries using experienced creative writers and unseen short stories.

So in summary, the paper provides an analysis of LLM narrative understanding through an evaluation methodology using unseen short stories and ratings from the authors of those stories. It also shows that LLM self-evaluations are not reliable replacements for human judgments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs): GPT-4, Claude-2.1, LLama-2-70B. Evaluated on their ability to summarize short stories.

- Narrative summarization: Summarizing fiction short stories. Challenging due to nonlinear timelines, subtext, creative language. 

- Faithfulness: Accuracy of the summary in representing details from the original story. Biggest category of errors was misinterpreting feelings and reactions of characters.

- Analysis: Ability of the summary to provide interpretation and thematic analysis of the story. Models surprisingly good at times.

- Methodology: Work directly with writers, use their unpublished stories unseen by models, get expert evaluation from the writers themselves on dimensions like faithfulness and analysis.

- Narrative theory: Use concepts like unreliable narrator, discourse structure to analyze impact on summarization. Unreliable narrators challenging.

- Limitations: Small number of stories and writers, restricted prompting strategies, inability to deeply evaluate model training.

So in summary, key terms cover the models evaluated, the narrative summarization task and associated challenges, the evaluation methodology and dimensions, the involvement of writers, findings around faithfulness and analysis errors, and limitations around scale and visibility into model training.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper employs a unique methodology of working directly with creative writers to obtain high-quality, unpublished short stories as test data. What are some of the key challenges and limitations associated with recruiting and compensating professional writers for such a study? How might the methodology be improved or expanded in future work?

2. The paper evaluates summarization models on attributes like faithfulness and thematic analysis using ratings from the writers themselves. What are some potential issues with having authors evaluate summaries of their own stories? How could the evaluation approach account for potential biases?  

3. The study finds that large language models struggle with interpreting difficult subtext and character feelings even in their best summaries. What specific approaches could help models better understand nuanced details related to emotion, motivation, and unreliable narrators?

4. The error analysis reveals that most faithfulness mistakes relate to incorrectly capturing character feelings. Why might this be such a persistent challenge for language models? What theories of mind and narrative could better inform future work on modeling emotional arcs and internal states?

5. The methodology demonstrates that language model judgments of summary quality do not reliably match expert human evaluation. What specific gaps might exist between the models' understanding of coherence, faithfulness, etc. and human perspective on those attributes? How can we characterize and address this disparity?

6. The study analyzes the impact of stylistic elements like unreliable narrators and detailed subplots on summarization quality. What other intrinsic characteristics of narrative text could substantially affect a model's interpretive capabilities? How can we systematically study such linguistic variables?  

7. The paper establishes that long-context language models can summarize lengthy stories as capably as short ones. What modifications would enable extending the approach to even longer forms of fiction like novellas and novels? What new challenges might emerge at such scales?

8. How robust are the findings to factors like prompt design, temperature sampling, model architecture, and date of access? What specific prompts and experimental controls could help verify the consistency of observations across conditional generations? 

9. The paper demonstrates mutual benefit in collaborating with writer communities. What other domains might benefit from a participatory methodology where practitioners help directly construct and evaluate test datasets? What ethical considerations exist regarding compensation, ownership, and privacy?

10. The study focuses solely on English fiction. How might the difficulties observed translate to or diverge from those in non-English literary traditions? What multivariate analyses could reveal interactions between linguistic and cultural variables in narrative understanding?
