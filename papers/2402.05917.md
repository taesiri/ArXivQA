# [Point-VOS: Pointing Up Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current video object segmentation (VOS) methods rely on dense mask annotations for training and testing, which is very costly and limits the scale of VOS datasets. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new point-based VOS (\pointvos) formulation that uses only sparse point annotations instead of masks, reducing annotation effort.

- A semi-automatic annotation pipeline is proposed to efficiently annotate videos with points. It starts from an initial localization and uses an interactive segmentation model and a VOS model to automatically generate point candidates on objects, which are then verified by annotators.

- Two large-scale \pointvos datasets are introduced: \pointvos Oops with 13K objects in 8K videos, and \pointvos Kinetics with 120K objects in 24K videos. Together they contain 19M point annotations.

- A \pointvos benchmark is launched where methods are trained on points and evaluated on points or pseudo-masks. Strong baselines are developed by adapting STCN to points and by training STCN on pseudo-masks.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel \pointvos task with sparse point supervision that substantially reduces annotation cost

2) Efficient semi-automatic annotation pipeline to collect two very large-scale multi-modal \pointvos datasets

3) New benchmark to evaluate VOS methods on point supervision during both training and inference

4) Adaptations of STCN to point supervision as strong baselines, showing performance close to the fully supervised setup

5) Demonstrates usefulness of new annotations by improving vision-language models for the Video Narrative Grounding task

In summary, the paper proposes a paradigm shift in VOS to point-based formulation, enabling more efficient annotation of much larger datasets. This is shown to push vision-language models while retaining most of the performance of the costly fully supervised VOS task.
