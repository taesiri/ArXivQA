# [Point-VOS: Pointing Up Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current video object segmentation (VOS) methods rely on dense mask annotations for training and testing, which is very costly and limits the scale of VOS datasets. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new point-based VOS (\pointvos) formulation that uses only sparse point annotations instead of masks, reducing annotation effort.

- A semi-automatic annotation pipeline is proposed to efficiently annotate videos with points. It starts from an initial localization and uses an interactive segmentation model and a VOS model to automatically generate point candidates on objects, which are then verified by annotators.

- Two large-scale \pointvos datasets are introduced: \pointvos Oops with 13K objects in 8K videos, and \pointvos Kinetics with 120K objects in 24K videos. Together they contain 19M point annotations.

- A \pointvos benchmark is launched where methods are trained on points and evaluated on points or pseudo-masks. Strong baselines are developed by adapting STCN to points and by training STCN on pseudo-masks.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel \pointvos task with sparse point supervision that substantially reduces annotation cost

2) Efficient semi-automatic annotation pipeline to collect two very large-scale multi-modal \pointvos datasets

3) New benchmark to evaluate VOS methods on point supervision during both training and inference

4) Adaptations of STCN to point supervision as strong baselines, showing performance close to the fully supervised setup

5) Demonstrates usefulness of new annotations by improving vision-language models for the Video Narrative Grounding task

In summary, the paper proposes a paradigm shift in VOS to point-based formulation, enabling more efficient annotation of much larger datasets. This is shown to push vision-language models while retaining most of the performance of the costly fully supervised VOS task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new point-based video object segmentation task and annotation scheme using sparse point supervision, and demonstrates its value by annotating large datasets and adapting methods to this weaker supervision signal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a new point-based video object segmentation (VOS) task called Point-VOS, which uses spatially and temporally sparse point annotations instead of dense masks during training and test time. This substantially reduces annotation effort.

2) It introduces an efficient semi-automatic annotation pipeline to collect point annotations on videos. Using this, the authors annotate two large-scale datasets - Point-VOS Oops and Point-VOS Kinetics - which contain multi-modal (vision and language) annotations.

3) It establishes a benchmark for Point-VOS and presents baseline methods by adapting state-of-the-art VOS models like STCN to work with point supervision. The results demonstrate that the point annotations are valuable for VOS.

4) It shows the usefulness of the multi-modal annotations collected in Point-VOS datasets by using them to improve performance on the Video Narrative Grounding task which connects vision and language.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Point-VOS task and annotation pipeline to collect point annotations more efficiently, using them to create large-scale multi-modal datasets, and showing their utility for VOS and vision-language tasks.
