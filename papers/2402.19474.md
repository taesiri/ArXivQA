# [The All-Seeing Project V2: Towards General Relation Comprehension of the   Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19474)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to comprehend relations between objects in images and are prone to hallucinations when answering relation-based questions. 
- Lack of appropriate modeling methods and training data tailored for relation comprehension.
- No systematic benchmark to evaluate relation comprehension abilities of MLLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel task called Relation Conversation (ReC) which unifies text generation, object localization and relation comprehension. ReC links all mentioned objects and predicates to image regions.
- Construct All-Seeing Dataset v2 (AS-V2) of 127K high-quality ReC samples to unlock ReC ability of MLLMs.
- Propose Circular-based Relation Probing Evaluation (CRPE) benchmark to quantitatively evaluate relation comprehension of MLLMs.
- Introduce All-Seeing Model v2 (ASMv2) trained on AS-V2 and other corpora, which demonstrates powerful relation comprehension and state-of-the-art performance on tasks like open-ended scene graph generation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel ReC task and AS-V2 dataset to enhance relation comprehension of MLLMs while maintaining grounding and referring capabilities.
- CRPE benchmark to systematically evaluate relation comprehension ability of MLLMs. 
- ASMv2 model which excels in perceiving all objects in images and comprehending relations between them, significantly outperforming MLLMs like LLaVA on CRPE.
- State-of-the-art performance of ASMv2 on open-ended scene graph generation and other vision-language tasks, demonstrating its general capabilities.

The paper introduces effective solutions for improving relation comprehension in MLLMs, backed by new datasets, models and evaluation benchmarks. This can facilitate future research towards artificial general intelligence.
