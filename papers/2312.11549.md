# [Label-Free Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Traditional anomaly detection methods for multivariate time series (MTS) rely on training datasets consisting of only normal data under one-class classification. However, in practical situations, it is difficult and costly to guarantee that the entire training data is clean (anomaly-free). Such cases can degrade anomaly detection performance of existing methods that fit normal training data as a distribution.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes MTGFlow and MTGFlow_cluster, unsupervised anomaly detection methods for MTS that estimate density of all training data and determine anomalies based on the density of test data within the fitted distribution. This relies on the assumption that anomalies occur in sparse/low-density regions compared to normal data. 

- MTGFlow utilizes a dynamic graph structure learning module to model complex and evolving interdependencies among different entities (time series) over time. This is combined with an RNN module to capture temporal correlations.

- An entity-aware normalizing flow module is used to map each entity's time series to a unique target distribution based on its characteristics. MTGFlow_cluster additionally clusters similar entities and maps them to a common target distribution.

Main Contributions:
- Propose unsupervised methods for MTS anomaly detection without needing anomaly-free training data.

- Model interdependencies among entities as a dynamic graph to capture complex and evolving relationships.  

- Introduce entity/cluster-aware normalizing flow for fine-grained density estimation that handles diverse characteristics of entities.

- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple MTS datasets, outperforming previous methods by 4-5% AUROC on certain datasets.

- Demonstrate robustness to anomaly contamination and generalizability to both unsupervised and one-class classification settings.
