# [Learning Triangular Distribution in Visual World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18605)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Triangular Distribution Transform (TDT) to establish a linear mapping between visual feature differences and corresponding label differences for vision regression tasks. The key idea is to transform nonlinearly correlated image features into linearly correlated ones using parameter-free TDT. This allows a simple linear model to map features to labels while preserving their differences. TDT is optimized using a symmetry-related loss and commutativity-related loss to learn the triangular distribution. Experiments on facial age estimation, aesthetic assessment, and illumination estimation demonstrate that simply plugging TDT into existing models boosts performance. On age estimation, TDT with DAA achieves state-of-the-art results on MegaAge-Asian and FG-NET datasets. For aesthetic assessment, TDT+SAAN ranks 2nd on TAD66K. On illumination estimation, TDT significantly improves angular error over prior arts on Color Checker dataset. Ablations verify that the proposed losses are necessary for TDT. Overall, TDT provides an effective and portable way to inject linear discriminability into CNN features for better regression.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Triangular Distribution Transform (TDT) to establish a linear mapping between feature differences and label differences for vision regression tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It analyzes and lays the theoretical foundation for the Triangular Distribution Transform (TDT), which enables feature discrepancy to explain label difference in a linear way. 

2. It shows that with the proposed symmetry-related loss and commutativity-related loss, TDT can be learnt by mainstream backbone networks.

3. TDT outperforms other methods on facial age estimation, aesthetics estimation, and illumination estimation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

In summary, the paper proposes TDT, a general and simple framework to establish a mathematical connection between image features and labels. TDT transforms non-linear features into linearly correlated ones for label distribution learning. Experiments show TDT achieves on-par or better performance compared to prior arts when used as a plug-in module in mainstream networks.
