# [VidProM: A Million-scale Real Prompt-Gallery Dataset for Text-to-Video   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06098)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-video diffusion models like Sora heavily rely on prompts to generate videos, but there is no publicly available prompt dataset to support research in this area. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces VidProM, the first large-scale dataset with 1.67 million unique text-to-video prompts collected from real users. 
- The dataset contains 6.69 million videos generated from the prompts using 4 state-of-the-art diffusion models. 
- Prompts are embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model and have NSFW probabilities assigned.
- A subset named VidProS with over 1 million semantically unique prompts is also provided.

Comparison with Existing Datasets:
- Compared to the image prompt dataset DiffusionDB, VidProM has more unique prompts collected over a longer period, uses a better embedding method, and focuses specifically on video generation which requires more complex prompts.

Key Observations:  
- Analysis shows video prompts exhibit different distributions and semantics compared to image prompts, highlighting the need for a specialized text-to-video prompt dataset.  
- The prompts show user preference for topics like humans, sci-fi, animals indicating scope for better generative models.

Main Contributions:
- The first large-scale text-to-video prompt dataset to accelerate research.  
- In-depth analysis on the differences between image and video prompts.
- Outlines new research directions enabled such as prompt engineering, efficient generation, fake detection and copy detection for videos.

The paper makes the VidProM dataset publicly available to support the text-to-video generation research community.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How did the authors collect the source HTML files containing the text-to-video prompts from Pika's Discord channels? What tools did they use and what was the total time period of collection?

2. What was the process used to extract the prompts and timestamps from the HTML files? Were any filters or deduplication applied at this stage? 

3. Why did the authors choose to use the OpenAI text-embedding-3-large model to embed the prompts? What are the specific advantages of this model for embedding long and complex text-to-video prompts?

4. What toolkit was used to assign the NSFW probabilities to each prompt? How many different NSFW categories were assigned probabilities for and what thresholds were set for filtering?

5. How was the video generation workload distributed across servers? Detail the total number of servers, GPUs per server, and estimated overall GPU hours consumed.

6. What specific criteria were used to define semantically unique prompts in the VidProS subset? Explain how the threshold for maximum cosine similarity between prompts was set.

7. Compare and contrast at least 3 major differences between the prompts in DiffusionDB versus VidProM. How do these differences demonstrate the need for a specialized text-to-video prompt dataset?

8. Analyze the most frequently occurring topics and words in the prompts based on the visualizations. What inferences can be made about user preferences for text-to-video generation?

9. Explain at least 3 new research directions inspired by the introduction of the VidProM dataset, highlighting how VidProM can catalyze progress in each.

10. What steps could be taken in future work to enrich the diversity and size of the VidProM dataset? Are there any potential limitations of the current dataset that still need to be addressed?
