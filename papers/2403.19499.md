# [Client-supervised Federated Learning: Towards One-model-for-all   Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing personalized federated learning (PerFL) methods require extra model adaptation steps on each client's local data. This leads to practical challenges during model deployment and test time. The goal of this paper is to develop a PerFL method that can learn a single robust global model achieving competitive performance to personalized models without needing extra fine-tuning.

Proposed Solution - Client-Supervised Federated Learning (FedCS):
The key idea is that a single global model can achieve personalization if it can recognize client-specific biases. FedCS introduces a representation alignment (RA) module that projects instances into a latent space indicating client biases. A downstream decision module leverages both the bias representations and shared knowledge to make personalized predictions. 

A client-supervised optimization method is proposed to learn the RA module in a federated manner. An inductive bias assumes data from similar clients have similar representations. The alignment is posed as an eigenvalue problem and decomposed into local update steps that clients can optimize collaboratively.

Main Contributions:
1) First PerFL method based on a one-model-for-all strategy without needing extra fine-tuning during deployment. Personalization is achieved via learned latent representations indicating client bias.

2) A novel RA module that projects instances into a space embedding client-specific properties. Downstream modules can leverage this for personalization.

3) A client-supervised optimization framework that enables collaborative alignment of the latent space under federated constraints.

Experiments show FedCS can learn a robust global model achieving comparable or better performance versus PerFL methods needing adaptation, even on unseen test clients. The key advantage is avoiding extra on-device tuning.
