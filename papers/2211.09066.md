# Teaching Algorithmic Reasoning via In-context Learning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions and hypotheses seem to be:- How can we improve large language models' ability to learn algorithmic reasoning skills through in-context learning? - Can we teach LLMs complex algorithmic reasoning tasks through a curriculum of progressively more complex prompts that build on simpler skills?- What are the key capabilities required for LLMs to learn algorithmic skills through in-context learning? The paper identifies four key stages: (1) Teaching an algorithm as a skill (2) Skill accumulation (learning multiple skills) (3) Skill composition (building complex skills from simpler ones) (4) Using skills as tools.- Algorithmic prompting, which involves providing detailed step-by-step explanations of algorithms with examples, can significantly improve LLMs' systematic generalization on algorithmic reasoning tasks compared to existing prompting approaches.- LLMs can learn multiple algorithms simultaneously via a single prompt without significant interference.- LLMs have the capability to compose simple algorithmic skills learned via prompting to solve more complex algorithmic tasks.- Learned algorithmic skills can be utilized by LLMs as tools to improve performance on broader reasoning tasks, although issues like interference need to be addressed.In summary, the central hypothesis is that algorithmic reasoning can be taught to LLMs through in-context learning by using a curriculum of increasingly complex algorithmic prompts. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability and analyze the key stages involved in acquiring algorithmic skills through prompting.
