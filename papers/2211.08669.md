# [Addressing the issue of stochastic environments and local   decision-making in multi-objective reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08669)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on the challenge of learning optimal policies in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) problems with stochastic state transitions. Specifically, it examines the factors that influence the ability of MORL algorithms to reliably find policies that maximize the expected utility over multiple executions (scalarised expected return - SER) when using a non-linear utility function. 

The paper first establishes that existing MORL algorithms that rely solely on the accumulated rewards within an episode often fail to find the SER-optimal policies in stochastic environments. It replicates these baseline results on a simple MOMDP called Space Traders. Four approaches are then investigated to try to address this limitation:

1) Reward engineering: Modifying the original reward signal in Space Traders yielded some improvement, with the desired policy being found 50% of the time compared to 5% originally. But this approach was not robust when tested on a variant of the problem.

2) Augmenting state with global statistics (MOSS algorithm): Maintaining counts of state visits and estimating the probability/rewards associated with unvisited states allowed MOSS to outperform the baseline on the original Space Traders. However it still failed on variant environments.  

3) Options learning: By having the agent commit to a full policy rather than making single-step action selections, options learning reliably found the optimal policies. However it does not scale due to the curse of dimensionality.

4) Decaying learning rate: Across all methods, decaying the learning rate stabilized learning by reducing the impact of noise in the estimated Q-values, enabling reliable convergence. But the core SER issue remained unaddressed.

The key contributions are:
- Demonstrating the extent to which noisy Q-value estimates had previously interfered with evaluating MORL methods under SER criteria
- Clearly showing that none of the implemented approaches solve the fundamental problem of local decision making under stochastic transitions with non-linear utility functions
- Providing guidance as to productive areas for future research, such as policy gradient methods or distributional MORL.

The implications are that developing MORL algorithms for real-world problems involving uncertainty and complex preferences remains an open challenge. Hybrid approaches may hold promise for progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper empirically evaluates factors influencing the ability of multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms to find optimal policies under stochastic environments and nonlinear scalarization functions for the scalarised expected return criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) It identifies and demonstrates that existing multi-objective Q-learning algorithms may fail to find the scalarised expected return (SER) optimal policy in stochastic environments when using a non-linear scalarisation function like the thresholded lexicographic ordering (TLO). 

2) It explores several methods aimed at addressing this issue, including:
- Modifying the reward signal 
- Augmenting the state with global statistics (in the MOSS algorithm)
- Using options to encapsulate sequences of actions

3) A key finding is the extent to which noisy Q-value estimates impact the ability to learn optimal policies. Using a decaying learning rate is shown to help mitigate this.

4) The results show that none of the investigated methods are able to fully solve the identified issues in the general case. The paper concludes by identifying some potential directions for future research, including using policy-based methods or distributional reinforcement learning.

In summary, the paper clearly identifies and demonstrates a previously under-appreciated issue regarding multi-objective reinforcement learning in stochastic environments, provides an initial investigation of some methods aimed at addressing it, and lays out a research agenda for developing reliable multi-objective learning methods for this context.

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
- Scalarised expected return (SER) 
- Stochastic environments
- Value-based methods
- Q-learning algorithms
- Noisy Q-value estimates
- Options framework

The paper focuses on analyzing what factors influence the ability of value-based MORL Q-learning algorithms to find the SER optimal policy in stochastic environments when using non-linear scalarization functions. It empirically evaluates different approaches like modifying the reward signal, augmenting state with global statistics, and using options to address this challenge. A key finding is the impact of noisy Q-value estimates in preventing convergence to the optimal policy. Overall, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of challenges in applying MORL techniques to stochastic sequential decision problems with multiple conflicting objectives.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using global statistics to augment the state representation in MOQ-learning. What are some of the key challenges in estimating these statistics accurately, especially in complex stochastic environments? How might the approach be improved to get better estimates?

2. The two-phase variant of MOSS separates data gathering and learning phases. What are some ways the exploration strategy could be improved during data gathering to ensure trajectories associated with the optimal policy are properly represented? 

3. Could eligibility traces be useful during the data gathering phase to assign credit to rarely visited states that are part of optimal trajectories? How might this be implemented effectively?

4. What are some ways the length of the data gathering and learning phases could be automatically adapted based on measures of learning progress? Are there risks of overfitting with prolonged data gathering?

5. Option learning requires pre-defining all options. What are some ways options could be learned automatically to scale up the approach? Could hierarchies of options be beneficial? 

6. The paper identifies the issue of noisy Q-value estimates. What enhancements could be made to MOQ-learning to produce more stable value estimates over time?

7. What mechanisms could make MOQ-learning less sensitive to thresholds when scalarization functions like TLO are used? Could fuzzy thresholds help?

8. What modifications would be needed to apply the MOSS algorithm in a continuing task rather than episodic setting? How might average reward formulations be integrated?

9. Could model-based enhancements such as learned environment models be integrated with MOSS to improve data efficiency and handle partial observability? What challenges might arise?

10. The goal here is finding SER optimal policies - what changes would be needed to optimise for ESR instead? Would the same methods apply or would new approaches be needed?
