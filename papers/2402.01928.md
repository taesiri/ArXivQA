# [Robust Counterfactual Explanations in Machine Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01928)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Robust Counterfactual Explanations in Machine Learning: A Survey":

Problem:
Counterfactual explanations (CEs) are increasingly used to provide recourse and explainability for machine learning models. However, recent work has shown that state-of-the-art CE generation methods lack robustness - meaning the CEs they provide can easily become invalid under small changes in the model or environment. This is a major issue since invalid or unstable CEs would provide unreliable recourse, negatively impacting end users. 

Solution:
This paper provides the first comprehensive literature review of techniques for generating robust CEs. The authors identify and analyze four key categories of robustness being studied:

1. Robustness against model changes: Requires the CE to remain valid even if the model is retrained or updated.

2. Robustness against model multiplicity: Requires the CE to be valid across an ensemble of near-equally performing models. 

3. Robustness against noisy execution: Requires the CE to tolerate small perturbations at execution time.

4. Robustness against input changes: Requires CEs for similar inputs to also be similar.

For each category, the paper summarizes the problem formulation, evaluation metrics, algorithms, and results. Key techniques include robust optimization, increasing class score margins, formal verification methods, plausibility constraints, and diversity requirements.

Contributions:
- First comprehensive survey and taxonomy of research on robust CEs
- Analysis and classification of existing techniques by robustness type
- Discussion of limitations and open challenges, including robustness-cost tradeoffs, connections between robustness categories, links to fairness, and the need for standardized benchmarking.

The paper helps crystallize this emerging research area and provides a solid foundation for future work on reliable and trustworthy counterfactual explanations.
