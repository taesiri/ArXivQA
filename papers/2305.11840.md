# [SeeGULL: A Stereotype Benchmark with Broad Geo-Cultural Coverage   Leveraging Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11840)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research goals of this paper are:1. To develop a methodology to generate a large-scale, broad-coverage stereotype evaluation benchmark dataset using LLMs. 2. To demonstrate the utility of this benchmark dataset called SeeGULL for more comprehensive evaluation of stereotyping harms in NLP models compared to existing stereotype datasets.3. To capture the contextual and regional sensitivity of stereotypes by getting annotations from geographically diverse raters. 4. To quantify the offensiveness of stereotypes about different identity groups across regions.In particular, the authors aim to leverage the few-shot generative capabilities of large language models like PaLM, GPT-3 and T0 to automatically generate a broad set of stereotype candidates through prompting. They then get these candidates validated by situating the annotations in different geographic contexts using a globally diverse pool of raters. This allows them to create a benchmark dataset called SeeGULL that contains stereotypes about 179 identity groups across 178 countries and 8 regions. The key hypotheses seem to be:- LLMs can generate a broader coverage of stereotype candidates through few-shot prompting compared to purely manual collection.- Situating stereotype annotation in different geographic contexts will capture variation in perceptions about the same groups. - The resulting benchmark SeeGULL will enable more comprehensive evaluation of stereotyping harms in NLP models compared to existing, smaller datasets.The authors demonstrate the utility of SeeGULL for evaluating three NLP models on an NLI task, and find it uncovers more embedded harms, especially for understudied regions. They also collect offensiveness ratings for stereotypes and show variation across regions.
