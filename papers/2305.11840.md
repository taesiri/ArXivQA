# [SeeGULL: A Stereotype Benchmark with Broad Geo-Cultural Coverage   Leveraging Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11840)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research goals of this paper are:

1. To develop a methodology to generate a large-scale, broad-coverage stereotype evaluation benchmark dataset using LLMs. 

2. To demonstrate the utility of this benchmark dataset called SeeGULL for more comprehensive evaluation of stereotyping harms in NLP models compared to existing stereotype datasets.

3. To capture the contextual and regional sensitivity of stereotypes by getting annotations from geographically diverse raters. 

4. To quantify the offensiveness of stereotypes about different identity groups across regions.

In particular, the authors aim to leverage the few-shot generative capabilities of large language models like PaLM, GPT-3 and T0 to automatically generate a broad set of stereotype candidates through prompting. They then get these candidates validated by situating the annotations in different geographic contexts using a globally diverse pool of raters. This allows them to create a benchmark dataset called SeeGULL that contains stereotypes about 179 identity groups across 178 countries and 8 regions. 

The key hypotheses seem to be:

- LLMs can generate a broader coverage of stereotype candidates through few-shot prompting compared to purely manual collection.

- Situating stereotype annotation in different geographic contexts will capture variation in perceptions about the same groups. 

- The resulting benchmark SeeGULL will enable more comprehensive evaluation of stereotyping harms in NLP models compared to existing, smaller datasets.

The authors demonstrate the utility of SeeGULL for evaluating three NLP models on an NLI task, and find it uncovers more embedded harms, especially for understudied regions. They also collect offensiveness ratings for stereotypes and show variation across regions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel approach to create a large-scale stereotype evaluation benchmark dataset using a partnership between large language models (LLMs) and human annotators. 

2. The resulting dataset, called SeeGULL, which contains 7750 stereotypes about 179 identity groups spanning 178 countries across 8 regions and 6 continents, as well as state-level identities in the US and India.

3. Demonstrating SeeGULL's utility in detecting stereotyping harms in natural language inference models, with major gains in coverage for identity groups in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.

4. Obtaining fine-grained offensiveness ratings for the stereotypes in SeeGULL, showing identity groups in Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, and Latin America have the most offensive stereotypes. 

5. Using a geographically diverse annotator pool to demonstrate regional variations in stereotype perceptions about the same groups.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a scalable approach to create a broad-coverage stereotype evaluation benchmark by combining the generative capabilities of LLMs and situated human validation. The resulting SeeGULL dataset advances evaluation of AI models for stereotyping harms, especially for understudied global contexts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces SeeGULL, a new benchmark dataset containing over 7,750 stereotypes about 179 identity groups spanning 178 countries and 50 US states, generated using large language models and validated by globally diverse annotators to provide broad coverage of stereotypes with regional sensitivity and offensiveness ratings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper presents SeeGULL, a new dataset for evaluating stereotypes in language models. It is much larger and more diverse than existing stereotype evaluation datasets like StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs. SeeGULL covers 179 identity groups across 178 countries and 8 regions worldwide, whereas previous datasets focused mainly on Western contexts.

- The paper utilizes large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 in a novel way - to generate candidate stereotypes which are then validated by human raters. Most prior work relied solely on manual crowdsourcing to construct evaluation datasets. Leveraging LLMs allows for broader coverage of potential stereotypes.

- The dataset includes annotations about offensiveness of stereotypes and regional variability in stereotype perceptions. This provides richer contextual information compared to other datasets that only look at whether a statement is a stereotype. 

- Experiments demonstrate SeeGULL allows for more comprehensive evaluation of potential harms than existing benchmarks. Models exhibit more stereotyping on SeeGULL, especially for non-Western groups neglected by previous datasets.

- The approach of leveraging LLMs and getting socially situated validation from diverse annotators is extensible to other types of identities and evaluation datasets beyond stereotypes.

Overall, SeeGULL pushes forward the goal of broader, more culturally aware evaluation of AI systems. The coverage and contextual detail exceeds prior benchmarks constrained by manual crowdsourcing. The hybrid LLM-human approach could enable better datasets across other domains as well. This looks like an impactful contribution to the field of fair and socially-aware NLP.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Expanding the methodology to cover more dimensions beyond nationality/geography, such as race, gender, religion, etc. The approach proposed here can be extended to generate and validate stereotypes along other dimensions.

- Developing multilingual versions of the benchmark. The current work focuses on English, but they suggest expanding it to include stereotypes in multiple languages. 

- Incorporating more nuanced contextual information around stereotypes. The current work captures some regional differences in stereotype perceptions, but does not fully capture the context. Adding contextual details could be an area for future work.

- Exploring differences in out-region stereotypes using other reference regions beyond North America. The choice of North America as reference introduces some limitations, so comparing to other regions could reveal additional insights.

- Combining this data-driven approach with more participatory methods engaging directly with communities. The authors suggest complementing the current approach with community-engaged efforts for even broader coverage.

- Expanding the downstream tasks evaluated using SeeGULL. The authors demonstrate it on NLI, but suggest it could also be beneficial for QA, document classification, and other tasks.

- Developing mitigation strategies leveraging the broader set of stereotypes. The dataset could help develop more comprehensive interventions to mitigate stereotype biases.

In summary, the key directions are: expanding coverage across dimensions, languages, and contexts; combining data-driven and participatory approaches; evaluating on more tasks; and leveraging the data for bias mitigation. The authors present the current work as an initial step toward more comprehensive evaluation and measurement of stereotype harms.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents SeeGULL, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating stereotypes in natural language systems. The authors use large language models like GPT-3 to generate a broad set of potential stereotypes about national, state, and regional identity groups across the globe. They then have these stereotype candidates validated by crowdsourced annotators who are situated in the corresponding geographic and cultural contexts. This results in a benchmark containing over 7,750 stereotypes covering 179 identity groups across 178 countries and 8 global regions. The paper demonstrates how SeeGULL provides more comprehensive evaluation of stereotyping harms in tasks like natural language inference, uncovering significantly more issues than prior benchmark datasets which had limited coverage. SeeGULL also includes offensiveness ratings for the stereotypes, showing regional variation, as well as separate annotations capturing the sensitivity of stereotypes to geographic context. Overall, the work illustrates a novel methodology to leverage large language models and crowdsourcing to create richer, more diverse datasets for evaluating social biases in AI systems. The benchmark supports more rigorous testing of model fairness and safety in global deployments.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SeeGULL, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating stereotypes in natural language processing models. The authors generate candidate stereotype sentences using large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM. They then have the candidates validated by human annotators to identify which ones reflect real-world stereotypes. SeeGULL contains over 7,000 validated stereotype sentences covering 179 identity groups across 178 countries and 8 global regions. It also includes stereotypes for US states and Indian states. A key contribution is the broad coverage of geographic identities and the situating of stereotypes, with annotations from people living both within and outside each region. 

SeeGULL is shown to be useful for evaluating stereotype biases in models. By constructing an entailment dataset using SeeGULL stereotypes, the authors demonstrate it uncovers more biases in natural language inference models compared to prior datasets like StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs. Other analyses explore regional differences in stereotype perceptions and offensiveness ratings of stereotypes. Limitations include being English-only and relying on seed sets, but the methodology could extend to other languages and dimensions like race and religion. Overall, by generating candidates with LLMs and validating with globally diverse annotators, SeeGULL takes a novel approach to benchmark creation that provides broader coverage of identities and social nuance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach to create a broad-coverage stereotype evaluation benchmark by leveraging the few-shot generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like PaLM, GPT-3, and T0. First, they select seed stereotype examples from existing sources to provide as prompts to the LLMs to generate new potential stereotype candidates. The models are prompted with combinations of a few seed stereotypes and generate many new candidate tuples associating identities (like nationalities or US/Indian states) and descriptive attributes. These candidates are then scored for salience using TF-IDF to determine how uniquely the attribute describes the identity. The most salient candidates are validated by getting annotations from geographically diverse human raters on whether the association reflects a prevalent stereotype in their region. By combining LLM generation with situated human validation, the method obtains a large dataset of 7,750 validated stereotype tuples covering 179 identity groups across 6 continents and 50 US states. The method also captures regional variation in stereotypes by comparing annotations from within vs. outside the identity's region.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Large language models (LLMs) like BERT and GPT-2 have been shown to exhibit and propagate social biases and stereotypes. However, existing datasets for evaluating stereotypes in LLMs have limitations like small size, limited coverage of subgroups, lack of offensiveness ratings, and assumption of universal stereotypes. 

- The authors propose a new approach to create a large-scale, broad-coverage stereotype evaluation dataset called SeeGULL. It contains stereotypes about 179 identity groups across 178 countries and 8 global regions, as well as state-level stereotypes for the US and India.

- They use the generative capabilities of LLMs like PaLM, GPT-3 and T0 to automatically generate a large set of potential stereotype candidates through few-shot prompting. These candidates are then validated by a globally diverse pool of human annotators.

- SeeGULL captures offensiveness ratings for stereotypes and demonstrates differences in stereotype perception between annotators within vs outside the stereotyped region. It provides more comprehensive evaluation of embedded stereotypes in tasks like natural language inference.

- The key research problem is the lack of large, diverse, and socially-situated stereotype evaluation benchmarks. SeeGULL aims to address this by using LLMs and global annotators to create broad, contextual stereotype data at scale. The goal is better evaluation and mitigation of stereotyping harms in AI systems, especially as they expand globally.

In summary, the paper tackles the need for better global stereotype evaluation resources in AI using an LLM-human hybrid approach to generate and validate stereotype data across cultures at scale. The SeeGULL dataset enables more rigorous testing for stereotyping harms in NLP models.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces SeeGULL, a novel broad-coverage stereotype benchmark dataset created through an innovative partnership between large language models (LLMs) and human annotators. The authors leverage the few-shot generative capabilities of LLMs like PaLM, GPT-3, and T0 to produce candidate stereotypes about 179 identity groups spanning 178 countries across 8 geo-political regions and 6 continents. To validate the LLM-generated candidates as societally prevalent stereotypes, the authors recruit a globally diverse pool of human annotators situated within the respective identity group contexts. This results in 7750 validated stereotypes covering a significantly wider breadth of identities and geo-cultural contexts compared to prior benchmarks like StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs that rely solely on manual curation. The paper also captures multi-faceted aspects of stereotypes, including regional variations in their perception as well as ratings of their offensiveness. Through experiments on Natural Language Inference datasets constructed using SeeGULL, the authors demonstrate its usefulness in uncovering greater stereotyping harms in models, especially for previously under-represented regions like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, by generatively expanding stereotype coverage and situating their validation, SeeGULL enables more rigorous and holistic evaluations of AI systems to mitigate representation harms. The multi-faceted benchmark highlights the subjective situated nature of stereotypes and sets up frameworks for their nuanced study.
