# [PEARL: Prompting Large Language Models to Plan and Execute Actions Over   Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces PEARL, a framework for reasoning over long documents with large language models via planning and executing compositional actions. The central hypothesis is that decomposing complex reasoning tasks over long documents into a sequence of simpler executable actions can improve the performance of large language models on these tasks compared to standard prompting techniques like zero-shot prompting or chain-of-thought. Specifically, the paper proposes that prompting the LLM to generate a plan of actions for answering a question, and then executing that plan step-by-step can enable more accurate and comprehensive reasoning compared to directly prompting the LLM for an answer. The key research questions addressed are:1) Can large language models effectively generate reasonable action plans for answering questions that require complex reasoning over long documents? 2) Does executing the generated plans lead to more accurate answers compared to standard prompting baselines?3) Does each component of the PEARL framework (action mining, plan generation, plan execution) contribute positively to the overall performance?4) How does PEARL compare to other related prompting techniques like chain-of-thought when applied to complex reasoning over long documents?The central hypothesis is tested through experiments on a subset of the QuALITY dataset requiring reasoning over long narrative texts. The results show PEARL outperforms the baselines, supporting the hypothesis that decomposing via planning and execution is beneficial for this task. Ablations and comparisons to other techniques provide evidence that each component contributes positively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the main contributions of this paper:- The paper proposes PEARL, a new framework for improving reasoning over long documents with large language models (LLMs). PEARL has three main stages:1. Action mining: An LLM is prompted to generate a set of "actions" (functions for reasoning, like SUMMARIZE or FIND_EVENT) from training data. This allows the action set to be customized for the task.2. Plan formulation: Given a question, the LLM generates an executable plan consisting of a sequence of actions. This decomposes the complex reasoning task into smaller steps. 3. Plan execution: The LLM executes the plan step-by-step, using a prompt template filled with information from previous steps. This stage includes the long document.- PEARL is evaluated on a challenging subset of the QuALITY reading comprehension dataset requiring reasoning over long articles. It outperforms both zero-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting baselines.- Ablation experiments demonstrate the importance of each stage of PEARL - removing plan execution, reducing the number of actions, or removing plan refinement hurts performance.- Human evaluation of a sample of PEARL's plans finds them to be reasonable, though some contain unnecessary steps or miss key information.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating PEARL, a new prompting framework to improve complex reasoning over long documents. PEARL demonstrates the promise of strategically decomposing the task and leveraging LLMs for each stage.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a framework called PEARL that improves the ability of large language models like GPT-4 to reason over long documents by decomposing questions into plans consisting of executable actions which are then carried out over multiple passes through the document to arrive at more accurate and comprehensive answers compared to directly prompting the model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief comparison of this paper to other related work on reasoning over long documents with large language models:- This paper proposes a novel framework called PEARL that decomposes complex reasoning over long documents into three key stages - action mining, plan formulation, and plan execution. The idea of decomposing the reasoning process into executable modules/actions is unique compared to prior work like chain-of-thought prompting or self-asking. - Most prior work has focused on simpler reasoning tasks over short contexts rather than long documents. In contrast, PEARL is designed for and evaluated on complex QA over narratives of several thousand tokens, showing strong improvements over baselines.- Unlike Toolformer or ReACT which rely on predefined modules/tools, PEARL mines task-specific actions directly from the training data using an LLM, allowing it to adapt to new domains. The idea of learning a discrete action space is novel.- Compared to Plan-and-Solve which also uses planning, PEARL executes the LLM-generated plan step-by-step rather than just feeding the plan back into the LLM. The iterative execution is shown to be important.- Self-correction and self-refinement of the generated plans helps address potential errors. Human evaluation confirms the plans are mostly reasonable.Overall, PEARL's approach of decomposing reasoning into mineable actions, formulating executable plans, and iteratively executing the plans is unique compared to prior work. The results demonstrate PEARL's effectiveness on complex QA over long documents where most existing techniques are not directly applicable. It is an intriguing first step towards leveraging LLMs for long document reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring different variants and refinements of the PEARL framework, such as using different action spaces or incorporating additional stages like plan refinement. The authors mention trying PEARL on new datasets as an interesting direction.- Incorporating additional human feedback at different stages of PEARL, such as verifying the quality of model-generated plan demonstrations. This could further improve the framework.- Evaluating PEARL on even longer document QA datasets and analyzing its limitations. The authors are interested in pushing the capabilities of PEARL for complex reasoning over longer texts.- Studying the interpretability and faithfulness of the generated plans through further analysis and human evaluation. More analysis on where the plans go wrong could provide insights. - Developing better automatic evaluation metrics and datasets for long-form open-ended question answering, which remains a challenge. - Exploring the application of PEARL-like frameworks to other domains beyond reading comprehension that also require reasoning over long contexts.- Comparing PEARL to other related prompting techniques like Tree-REG on long document QA tasks.- Incorporating external knowledge or tools into the different components of PEARL, akin to approaches like Toolformer and Chameleon.In summary, the authors suggest further work on refining PEARL itself, evaluating it on more complex and longer documents, enhancing interpretability, developing better benchmarks, and extending the approach to other domains that require long context reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called PEARL for improving the ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to reason over long input documents in order to answer complex questions. PEARL has three main stages - action mining, plan formulation, and plan execution. In the action mining stage, the LLM generates a set of "actions" like SUMMARIZE or FIND_EVENT from training data. In the plan formulation stage, given a question, the LLM creates a plan consisting of a sequence of these actions. Finally, in the plan execution stage, the LLM executes the plan step-by-step on the long document via prompting templates to generate the final answer. Experiments on a subset of the QuALITY dataset requiring reasoning over narrative texts show that PEARL outperforms zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting baselines. The paper demonstrates the promise of using prompting and planning techniques to improve reasoning over long documents with LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a framework called PEARL for prompting large language models to reason over long documents. PEARL has three main stages - action mining, plan formulation, and plan execution. In the action mining stage, the language model is prompted to generate a set of "actions" or functions that can be used to solve questions in the dataset. These actions are formatted as functions with arguments like FIND_EVENT(article, event) that find and summarize event in the article. The next stage is plan formulation where for a given question, the model generates a plan consisting of a sequence of these action functions. The plan allows the output of one action to be fed as input to future actions to enable complex composition. Finally, in the plan execution stage, the model executes the plan action-by-action via prompts filled with the document and previous outputs. PEARL is evaluated on a subset of the QuALITY QA dataset requiring reasoning over long articles and is shown to outperform zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting baselines. Overall, PEARL demonstrates a way to decompose complex long document QA into more manageable components.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a framework called \compact for prompting large language models (LLMs) to reason over long documents. \compact has three main stages - action mining, plan formulation, and plan execution. In the action mining stage, the LLM is prompted to generate a set of "actions" or reasoning steps that can be applied to answer questions about documents, based on training data. For a new question, the LLM then generates a plan consisting of a sequence of actions from this set. Finally, the LLM executes each step of the plan on the long document via a prompt template, with the output of one step fed as input to later steps. So \compact allows decomposing complex reasoning into more manageable executable actions, while using the LLM's own capabilities to construct the action set and plans. This method is evaluated on a subset of the QuALITY reading comprehension dataset requiring reasoning over long narratives, and is shown to outperform baseline prompting techniques.
