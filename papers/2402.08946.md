# [Measuring Sharpness in Grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper focuses on the recently discovered machine learning phenomenon of "grokking", where models exhibit a delay between achieving high accuracy on the training set and validation/test sets. 

- While previous work has studied the delay (gap) in grokking, little attention has been paid to studying the "sharpness" (suddenness) of the accuracy jumps. Understanding sharpness is important for explaining the mechanisms behind grokking.

- The paper therefore aims to introduce techniques for reliably quantifying grokking properties like sharpness and gap, toward better understanding differences across models and tasks.

Methods
- The paper assumes training and validation accuracy curves follow the same general S-shape which can be fit by a function like the error function (erf). 

- Fitting such a function provides robust measures of sharpness via the maximum slope, and delay via the curve midpoint location. Relative measures can also be defined, enabling standardized comparisons.

- Two experimental settings are used to study trends between the relative grokking gap and sharpness: a theoretical linear student-teacher model from recent work, and a simple MLP model with engineered grokking.

Results
- In both settings, as the relative delay (gap) increases, the relative and absolute sharpness measures tend to decrease. 

- Initial explanations are provided for the MLP via a regularisation-based argument, and for the linear setting through an analytical sketch. But further work is required to fully explain the observed correlations.

Contributions
- Main contributions are introducing the use of functional fits to quantify sharpness/delay, empirically demonstrating decreasing sharpness with increasing gap, and making progress toward explaining this relationship to further understand mechanisms behind grokking.

Limitations and Future Work
- Several limitations are outlined, like extending empirical fits to more exotic curves, testing universality of S-shapes, and unifying terminology. Ongoing work looks to address these and strengthen links between theory and practice.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a technique to quantify the sharpness of transitions in training and validation accuracy during neural network grokking by fitting an error function, and uses this to investigate trends between relative grokking gap and measures of sharpness in both a theoretical linear framework and an MLP trained on concealed parity prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a robust technique for measuring grokking based on fitting an appropriate functional form to model the transitions in training and validation accuracy. The paper then uses this technique to investigate the sharpness of grokking transitions in two settings: a theoretical linear student-teacher framework and an MLP trained on concealed parity prediction. The key findings are that trends between relative grokking gap and measures of sharpness are similar in both settings, providing a step toward explaining common mechanisms influencing grokking sharpness across models and tasks. Overall, the paper demonstrates the utility of fitting error functions to quantify and compare properties of grokking.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Grokking - The phenomenon where a model achieves good performance on a validation set well after achieving the same on the training set. The paper focuses on measuring and analyzing this phenomenon.

- Sharpness - How sudden or sharp the transition is in performance between training and validation. The paper proposes methods to quantify sharpness of grokking. 

- Relative grokking gap - A measure of how delayed the validation performance is compared to training, defined in the paper. One of the key trends explored.

- Fitting functional forms - The paper fits error functions to the accuracy curves to get robust, mutually consistent measures of timing and sharpness of performance jumps.

- Linear student-teacher model - One of the two settings analyzed, with closed-form expressions for training dynamics. Allows controlling relative grokking gap.

- MLP for parity prediction - The second setting, where grokking gap is controlled by adding random "concealed" bits to the input.

- Relative and absolute sharpness - Two proposed measures of sharpness based on accuracy gradient that are analyzed against relative grokking gap.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper for measuring sharpness in grokking:

1) The paper assumes a shared functional form (Error function) between training and validation accuracy curves during grokking. Is there theoretical justification for why this specific functional form would emerge? Could other forms also work to quantify sharpness?

2) The relative sharpness measure relies on taking the ratio of derivatives of the accuracy curves. How sensitive is this measure to noise in the accuracy measurements during training? Could smoothing techniques make the sharpness estimates more robust?

3) For the absolute sharpness measure, the maximum slope is used. But the maximum slope will be sensitive to outliers. Could alternative summary statistics like the median slope also be reasonable sharpness measures? 

4) The error function fitting is done at the midpoint accuracy, since this aligns with the point of maximum slope. But could fitting at other accuracy thresholds also provide insight into the sharpness? How does the choice of threshold impact the sharpness trends?

5) The method currently relies on visually fitting the error function to accuracy curves. Could an automated fitting procedure be designed to systematically estimate the sharpness across tasks and models? What loss function should be optimized in the fit?

6) The method uses the relative grokking gap, defined based on epoch times for fixed accuracy. Could a similar framework be developed using wall-clock time instead of epochs? Would the trends in sharpness still hold?

7) For the MLP experiment, what specifically in the concealment strategy causes the sharpness to decrease with increased grokking gap? Can this be formally proven based on properties of the optimization landscape?

8) In the linear model, the equations permit an analytical relationship between sharpness and grokking gap. Does this provide any theoretical evidence for the mechanism behind the decreasing absolute sharpness? 

9) The method currently only examines two measures of sharpness on two specific setups. Could the framework be expanded to additional tasks and models where grokking occurs to validate universality?

10) The error function fits the central region of accuracy jumps well, but fails at the tails. Could the framework be expanded to quantify early and late stages of learning in addition to the sudden transition?
