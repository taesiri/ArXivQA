# [Multi-metrics adaptively identifies backdoors in Federated learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06601)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: how can we successfully leverage distance metrics to discriminate hostile updates from benign ones in order to defend against backdoor attacks in federated learning without sacrificing model performance? 

The authors identify two key limitations with existing distance-based defense methods:

1. Euclidean distance suffers from the "curse of dimensionality" and fails to discriminate between malicious and benign gradients in high-dimensional space. 

2. A single distance metric is insufficient since backdoor attacks have diverse characteristics and defenders have no knowledge of the underlying data distributions.

To address these limitations, the authors propose using multiple distance metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Cosine similarity) cooperatively with dynamic weighting to identify diverse types of malicious gradients. They aim to design an efficient defense that:

1) Is effective at identifying and eliminating malicious updates 

2) Preserves the benign performance of the global model

3) Is independent of specific attack strategies or data distributions

Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate that their multi-metric defense with dynamic weighting maintains high robustness and benign performance even against stealthy backdoor attacks that evade prior defenses.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that using multiple, adaptively weighted distance metrics will enable more successful discrimination of malicious updates to defend against diverse backdoor attacks in federated learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel defense method against backdoor attacks in federated learning using multi-metrics and dynamic weighting. 

2. It shows that Manhattan distance is more meaningful than Euclidean distance in high dimensions for discriminating between malicious and benign gradients.

3. It utilizes multiple metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Cosine similarity) cooperatively to identify diverse malicious gradients brought by different attacks and environments. 

4. It applies a whitening transformation and generates dynamic weights to handle non-IID data distributions and different scales of metrics.

5. Through comprehensive experiments, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in maintaining high robustness while preserving benign performance, especially against stealthy backdoor attacks that evade prior defenses. 

6. The proposed defense is shown to be applicable under generic adversary models without assumptions on attack strategies or data distributions.

In summary, the key innovation is using multi-metrics with dynamic weighting to adaptively identify backdoors in federated learning. By introducing Manhattan distance and leveraging multiple metrics cooperatively, the defense becomes more effective against stealthy attacks and varying environments. The dynamic weighting also makes the defense robust under non-IID data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new defense method for federated learning using multiple distance metrics with dynamic weighting to identify and exclude malicious backdoor updates, showing improved robustness against stealthy attacks without sacrificing model performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares with other related research in the field of defending against backdoor attacks in federated learning:

- Previous defenses based on statistical differences (e.g. scoring or distance metrics) are often limited against stealthy attacks where the malicious gradients are similar to benign ones, or under non-IID data distributions. This paper proposes improvements by using multiple metrics with dynamic weighting to identify diverse malicious gradients.

- Differential privacy-based defenses can resist stealthy attacks but significantly degrade model performance and convergence speed. In contrast, this paper aims to achieve high robustness without sacrificing benign performance. 

- The paper introduces Manhattan distance for the first time to alleviate the issues with Euclidean distance becoming meaningless in high dimensions. It theoretically proves and empirically validates Manhattan distance as more meaningful than Euclidean distance.

- Most existing methods make strong assumptions about attack strategies or data distributions. A key contribution here is developing a defense that is assumption-independent and adaptive to different environments.

- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate this defense maintains both high robustness and benign accuracy under challenging stealthy attacks like Edge-case PGD, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main novelty lies in the adaptive multi-metric approach to identify diverse backdoor attacks, the introduction of Manhattan distance, and achieving robustness without sacrificing performance or making limiting assumptions. The empirical results validate the effectiveness over a wide range of scenarios.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing more robust and adaptive defenses against backdoor attacks in federated learning. The paper proposes a new multi-metrics based defense, but suggests more work could be done to make defenses more universally effective against different types of attacks and data distributions.

- Exploring other distance metrics beyond Euclidean and Manhattan distance for distinguishing between malicious and benign model updates in federated learning. The authors show Manhattan distance is better than Euclidean in high dimensions, but suggest evaluating other metrics as well.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why certain distance metrics work better than others for backdoor defense in high dimensional spaces like neural network parameters. The authors provide some empirical analysis but suggest more theoretical work could be useful.

- Evaluating the effectiveness of multi-metric defenses on a wider range of federated learning tasks, datasets, and models. The authors demonstrate results on image classification but suggest expanding the evaluation to other domains.

- Exploring privacy-preserving techniques for backdoor defenses that avoid inverting or reconstructing user data from model updates. The authors mention some existing defenses violate privacy requirements.

- Developing adaptive methods to set the hyperparameters like the fraction of benign updates selected for aggregation in each round of federated learning. The authors use a fixed fraction but suggest adaptive selection could help.

- Reducing the computational overhead of multi-metric backdoor defenses to improve efficiency and scalability. The authors acknowledge their method incurs some additional costs.

In summary, the main directions are developing more adaptive, efficient, and universal backdoor defenses, evaluating on more diverse tasks, establishing better theory, and preserving privacy. The authors propose multi-metrics as a promising approach but suggest lots of potential for future work in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new defense method against backdoor attacks in federated learning. It first discusses limitations of prior defenses, namely the curse of dimensionality making Euclidean distances ineffective and single metrics being unable to handle diverse attacks. To address this, the defense uses multiple metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Cosine similarity) as features to identify malicious gradients, claiming Manhattan is more meaningful in high dimensions. It also applies a whitening process for dynamic weighting to handle varying data distributions and attacks. Experiments across datasets, models and attacks show the defense maintains high robustness and performance. Particularly, it achieves the lowest backdoor accuracy under challenging edge-case PGD attacks that evade prior methods. The defense is shown to work invariantly across varying non-IID degrees and attack frequencies. Ablations justify the multi-metric design. By adaptively leveraging multiple metrics with dynamic weighting, the defense resists diverse attacks without assumptions on data distribution or attack strategy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new defense method against backdoor attacks in federated learning. Backdoor attacks aim to manipulate the behavior of the trained model on specific inputs without affecting overall performance. Existing defenses rely on assumptions about data distributions or attack strategies, making them vulnerable to more advanced attacks. To address this, the paper presents a multi-metric defense that adapts to different attacks and environments. 

First, the Manhattan distance metric is introduced which is more meaningful than Euclidean distance in high dimensions like neural networks. Second, multiple metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Cosine similarity) are used cooperatively to identify diverse malicious gradients. A dynamic weighting method handles correlations between metrics and adapts to different distributions. Experiments show this defense maintains high accuracy while resisting advanced backdoor attacks that bypass prior defenses. The key novelty is using adaptive multi-metrics to identify malicious gradients without assumptions, providing an effective and robust defense.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel defense against backdoor attacks in federated learning using multi-metrics and dynamic weighting. The key ideas are 1) Using Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean distance to better discriminate malicious gradients in high dimensions. 2) Leveraging multiple metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Cosine similarity) cooperatively to identify malicious gradients with diverse properties under different attacks. 3) Applying a whitening transformation and generating dynamic weights to handle the variability of gradients caused by non-IID data distributions. Specifically, the defense first defines a gradient feature using the three metrics. It then computes a dynamic weight matrix through whitening to handle correlations and variability. After that, each gradient is scored based on its divergence from an ideal gradient. Finally, only gradients with high scores are aggregated using FedAvg while malicious ones are discarded. Experiments show this defense maintains high robustness and benign accuracy against challenging backdoor attacks like Edge-case PGD.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem addressed in this paper are:

- Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across distributed devices without exchanging local data. However, FL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks where adversaries manipulate the model's behavior on specific inputs.

- Existing defenses against backdoor attacks have limitations:
    - Scoring-based defenses make assumptions about attack strategies or data distributions, which can be bypassed by advanced attacks.  
    - Differential privacy-based defenses can resist stealthy attacks but significantly degrade model performance.

- Two key limitations of distance-based defenses:
    1) Euclidean distance loses sensitivity in high dimensions ("curse of dimensionality").
    2) A single distance metric cannot handle diverse malicious gradients from different attacks and environments.

- The main research questions posed are:
    - Can we defend against stealthy backdoor attacks without sacrificing model performance?
    - How to successfully leverage distance metrics to distinguish malicious updates from benign ones?

- To address these questions, the authors propose a multi-metric distance-based defense with dynamic weighting that can identify diverse backdoor attacks and adapt to different data distributions.

In summary, the paper aims to develop a robust distance-based defense for federated learning that maintains high model utility while providing strong backdoor attack resistance without assumptions on the attacks.
