# [Are aligned neural networks adversarially aligned?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: Are aligned neural network models "adversarially aligned"?In other words, the paper investigates whether neural network models that have been trained or fine-tuned to be "helpful and harmless" (aligned) remain robustly aligned when presented with adversarial examples - inputs that are intentionally designed to cause the model to produce harmful or toxic outputs. The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Existing NLP attack methods may not be powerful enough to reliably evaluate the adversarial robustness of aligned language models. The paper provides evidence that current attacks often fail to find adversarial inputs even when it's possible to guarantee their existence.2) Aligned multimodal text-vision models can be more easily attacked by perturbing the input image. The paper shows these models can be induced to generate toxic or harmful outputs through small adversarial image perturbations. 3) The failure of current NLP attacks does not prove text-only models are adversarially aligned; the conjecture is that improved attacks may succeed in inducing harmful behaviors.So in summary, the central research question is evaluating whether aligned models remain robustly aligned under adversarial attacks, especially focused on limitations of current NLP attacks and vulnerabilities in multimodal models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper studies the adversarial robustness of large language models (LLMs) that have been aligned to be helpful and harmless, especially in response to user interactions. The main contributions are:1. It shows that existing NLP optimization attacks often fail to generate adversarial examples causing aligned LLMs to emit harmful content, even when solutions are known to exist. This suggests current attacks are not powerful enough to properly evaluate adversarial robustness.2. It demonstrates successful adversarial attacks on multimodal (text + image) aligned LLMs by perturbing the image input. This indicates potential vulnerabilities exist even in aligned LLMs. 3. Based on the results, it conjectures that improved future NLP attacks may be able to induce harmful behaviors in text-only aligned LLMs as well. It calls for more research into stronger attacks to properly evaluate adversarial robustness.4. The results suggest current alignment techniques may not make models robustly aligned under adversarial conditions. More foundational work on attacks/defenses is needed to develop techniques that remain reliable against adversarial inputs.In summary, the key contribution is highlighting limitations in current methods for evaluating and ensuring adversarial robustness of aligned LLMs, especially against optimized malicious inputs. The results motivate further research into stronger attacks and defenses for robust alignment.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper studies whether aligned language models trained to be helpful and harmless via techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback are still aligned when presented with adversarial examples, finding existing NLP attacks fail but image attacks easily trick multimodal models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper seems to make several novel contributions to the field of adversarial machine learning and AI alignment research:1. It is one of the first works to specifically study adversarial robustness in the context of aligned AI systems. Most prior work on adversarial attacks focuses on traditional ML tasks like image classification or QA, but does not consider broader alignment goals. This paper nicely unifies these two areas.2. The paper provides evidence that existing NLP attacks may not be sufficiently powerful to evaluate alignment techniques. While prior works have speculated on this, this paper constructs explicit test cases to confirm the attacks' limitations. Their failure even on cases where a solution is guaranteed to exist is an important result.3. The paper demonstrates a new vulnerability in multimodal AI systems, showing they can be easily attacked via perturbations to the image. While multimodality has been proposed as a way to make models more robust, this paper suggests the opposite and is one of the first works revealing this specific threat vector.4. Based on the ease of attacking multimodal models, the paper makes an intriguing conjecture that stronger attacks could induce similar adversarial behavior in text-only models. This novel hypothesis helps connect insights across modalities and sets an agenda for future work.Overall, I think this paper makes several valuable contributions at the intersection of two important topics. The results on limitations of current attacks and vulnerability of multimodal models appear quite novel. The writing generally does a good job situating the work in the context of prior literature, and sets up interesting open questions for future work to explore. This seems like a useful advance for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading, the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing stronger NLP optimization attacks to enable more comprehensive adversarial robustness evaluations of aligned LLMs. The attacks should be able to pass the proposed test cases to be considered reliable. This will help improve defenses against adversarial examples.- Studying whether existing attack and defense insights from the adversarial machine learning literature will transfer well to the domain of aligned language models. Having a solid foundation of understanding attacks is critical for designing robust defenses.- Using the foundational work on attacks and defenses to inform the development of improved model alignment techniques that remain reliable even in adversarial environments. The goal is to design adversarially aligned language models.- Exploring the cause of increased vulnerability in multimodal models and using this knowledge to create more robust implementations. Different design choices significantly affect attack success rates.- Investigating if improved NLP attacks can induce harmful outputs in otherwise aligned language models, as conjectured based on evidence presented. Resolving this open question requires developing substantially stronger text attacks.In summary, the key directions are: stronger attacks for evaluation, transferring insights from adversarial ML, improving alignment techniques, understanding multimodal vulnerabilities, and resolving if aligned models are adversarially aligned. The end goal is more robustly aligned models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper studies whether neural networks that have been aligned to be helpful and harmless (such as through reinforcement learning from human feedback) remain robustly aligned when presented with adversarially chosen inputs. They find that existing NLP optimization attacks fail to reliably attack text-based aligned models, even when adversarial examples are known to exist via brute force search. However, they show that multimodal models which accept both text and images can be easily attacked by providing adversarial perturbations to the image. Based on this, they conjecture that improved attacks focused on text may also succeed in attacking text-only models as well. Overall, the paper argues that adversarial robustness remains an open question for aligned models, both text-only and multimodal. More work is needed to develop stronger attacks to properly evaluate alignment techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:Paragraph 1: This paper studies the adversarial robustness of aligned neural networks. Aligned neural networks refer to models that have been fine-tuned to be "helpful and harmless." The authors evaluate existing NLP attacks on aligned chatbots and find they are largely ineffective, but it is unclear if this is due to the attacks being weak or the defenses being robust. They then show that multimodal models which accept both text and images are easily attacked by adding small perturbations to the input image. Based on this, they conjecture that improved attacks may be able to find adversarial text examples as well. They argue that understanding potential vulnerabilities is key to designing truly robust defenses.Paragraph 2: The paper first provides background on large language models and techniques to align them. It then evaluates prior adversarial text attacks on aligned chatbots and finds they often fail, even with more tokens of control. To determine if this is due to weak attacks or robust defenses, the authors construct test cases with guaranteed solutions and show current attacks still fail on these. Next, the paper demonstrates successful attacks on multimodal models by perturbing the input image. The perturbations reliably induce toxic and otherwise harmful outputs. The authors posit that similar attacks may succeed on text-only models, calling for more research into stronger text attacks and defenses. Overall, the paper concludes that while aligned models appear mostly harmless today, their true adversarial robustness remains an open question.
