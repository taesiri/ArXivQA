# [Generating Explanations to Understand and Repair Embedding-based Entity   Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04877)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents ExEA, the first framework for generating explanations of embedding-based entity alignment (EA) models and using those explanations to repair EA results. Given an EA pair predicted by a model, ExEA first matches the triples surrounding the two entities to build a semantic matching subgraph that serves as a local explanation. It then constructs an alignment dependency graph to provide an abstract understanding of how the EA pair influences and depends on other aligned entities. Finally, ExEA leverages the graph to detect and resolve three types of EA conflicts: relation alignment conflicts arising from incompatible relations, one-to-many conflicts violating entity distinctiveness, and low-confidence conflicts indicating potentially erroneous alignments. Experiments on five datasets show that ExEA generates high-fidelity explanations efficiently and effectively repairs EA results, significantly improving alignment accuracy. For instance, with ExEA's repair, even a simple model like MTransE can surpass state-of-the-art accuracy on some datasets. The paper demonstrates the value of ExEA's model-agnostic framework for explaining and refining embedding-based entity alignment.

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a definition of explanation for embedding-based entity alignment (EA), which considers the fidelity of EA results.

2. It proposes ExEA, an extensible framework that is able to generate high quality explanations for a given EA model. ExEA can also repair the entity alignment results. It can be applied to any embedding-based EA model.  

3. It incorporates four representative EA models into ExEA and evaluates their effectiveness on benchmark datasets.

4. It makes several findings on embedding-based EA:
(a) Simple models can also achieve high accuracy by effectively repairing alignment conflicts. 
(b) The one-to-many alignment is the most common and most influential conflict.
(c) There are some alignments that cannot be identified based on structures in the benchmark.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the ExEA framework for generating explanations and repairing results for embedding-based entity alignment models. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and generalization ability.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generating Explanations to Understand and Repair Embedding-based Entity Alignment":

Problem:
Entity alignment (EA) is an important task that seeks to find identical entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs). Recent embedding-based EA models have achieved high accuracy but they lack explanations for their alignment decisions. Providing explanations is important to understand model behaviors, judge result reliability, and reveal model differences. However, explaining embedding-based EA is challenging due to the lack of prior work, model complexity, and the need to utilize explanations for result repair.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a framework called ExEA that can generate explanations for embedding-based EA models and leverage the explanations to repair alignment results. The key idea is to match neighborhood subgraphs of aligned entity pairs as explanations. Specifically, ExEA first finds aligned neighbor entities and matches their relation paths to build a semantic matching subgraph. It then constructs an alignment dependency graph (ADG) to quantify the influence of different explanation components on the alignment confidence. Finally, ExEA detects and resolves three types of EA conflicts: relation alignment conflicts, one-to-many conflicts, and low-confidence conflicts. The repair is conducted by revising problematic alignments based on explanation confidence.

Main Contributions:
- Provides the first definition of EA explanation based on fidelity to model predictions
- Proposes the ExEA framework that can generate explanations and repair results for any embedding-based EA model
- Incorporates four representative EA models into ExEA and shows significant performance gains
- Makes findings on embedding-based EA: (1) Simple models can also achieve high accuracy via repair (2) One-to-many conflict is the most common and impactful (3) Some alignments cannot be identified from structures in the dataset

The paper demonstrates the ability of ExEA to generate high-quality explanations efficiently and repair EA results effectively. The framework exhibits strong generalization ability across models and robustness against data noise.
