# [Generating Explanations to Understand and Repair Embedding-based Entity   Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04877)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents ExEA, the first framework for generating explanations of embedding-based entity alignment (EA) models and using those explanations to repair EA results. Given an EA pair predicted by a model, ExEA first matches the triples surrounding the two entities to build a semantic matching subgraph that serves as a local explanation. It then constructs an alignment dependency graph to provide an abstract understanding of how the EA pair influences and depends on other aligned entities. Finally, ExEA leverages the graph to detect and resolve three types of EA conflicts: relation alignment conflicts arising from incompatible relations, one-to-many conflicts violating entity distinctiveness, and low-confidence conflicts indicating potentially erroneous alignments. Experiments on five datasets show that ExEA generates high-fidelity explanations efficiently and effectively repairs EA results, significantly improving alignment accuracy. For instance, with ExEA's repair, even a simple model like MTransE can surpass state-of-the-art accuracy on some datasets. The paper demonstrates the value of ExEA's model-agnostic framework for explaining and refining embedding-based entity alignment.
