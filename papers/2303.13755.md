# [Sparsifiner: Learning Sparse Instance-Dependent Attention for Efficient   Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13755)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we design a sparse attention mechanism for vision transformers (ViTs) that is efficient, flexible, and captures the instance-dependent distribution of semantic information in images? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Learning sparse, unstructured attention patterns in a content-dependent way will allow more efficient use of the limited attention budget compared to fixed sparse patterns like in prior work. 2) Pruning individual attentional connectivities instead of whole tokens will give greater flexibility to reduce FLOPs in early layers without hurting accuracy.3) Reconstructing a sparse full-rank attention matrix guided by a learned connectivity mask will better preserve the information in the full attention matrix compared to using a low-rank attention matrix directly.In summary, the main research goals seem to be developing an efficient attention mechanism that is adaptive to image content and avoids restrictions on model accuracy and flexibility found in prior sparse ViT methods. The paper proposes a new approach called Sparsifiner to achieve these goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called Sparsifiner to learn instance-dependent sparse attention patterns for efficient vision transformers (ViTs). The key ideas are:- They propose a lightweight connectivity mask predictor module to estimate the connectivity scores between token pairs. Two tokens will have high connectivity if they are relevant semantically or spatially. - The connectivity masks are binarized and very sparse. This allows accelerating the network via sparse computations in the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) module.- Instead of using fixed/structured sparse attention patterns like prior works, Sparsifiner learns sparse unstructured attention patterns that are dependent on the input image content. This is more flexible and better approximates the full attention.- They show Sparsifiner produces superior trade-off between computation and accuracy compared to token pruning methods on ImageNet classification. It reduces MHSA FLOPs by 48%-69% with minimal accuracy drop.- Sparsifiner is complementary to token pruning methods. Combining both techniques can reduce overall ViT FLOPs by over 60%.- They propose distillation-based training to learn Sparsifiner efficiently from pretrained ViTs within few epochs.In summary, the main contribution is an efficient and flexible way to learn sparse instance-dependent attention patterns for ViTs, instead of using fixed sparse patterns like prior works. This leads to better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.
