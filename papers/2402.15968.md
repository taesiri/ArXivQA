# [CoDream: Exchanging dreams instead of models for federated aggregation   with heterogeneous models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning models across decentralized data by aggregating model parameters at a central server. However, existing FL approaches have limitations in terms of flexibility, scalability, and privacy. They require consensus on the model architecture across clients, have communication costs that scale with model size, and can potentially leak private information during model sharing. 

Proposed Solution - CoDream:
The paper proposes a novel framework called CoDream that allows clients to collaboratively synthesize "dreams" - representations of the global data distribution. Instead of sharing model updates, clients share gradients computed on these randomly initialized "dreams" during federated optimization. This allows heterogeneous model architectures across clients, has fixed communication costs independent of model size, and provides privacy through two levels of abstraction from raw data.

Key Contributions:

1. A new perspective for FL - sharing "knowledge" extracted from models instead of model parameters themselves. This knowledge aggregation in input data space enables model agnostic learning.

2. The collaborative optimization framework addresses scalability issues in FL regarding communication, allowing large models to be used.

3. Sharing updates of "dreams" provides privacy benefits through data abstraction and compatibility with secure aggregation techniques. 

4. Extensive empirical validation including comparison to baselines on image datasets and ablation studies to analyze design choices.

In summary, the key innovation is a collaborative data synthesis approach for privacy-preserving and flexible knowledge sharing across decentralized silos, overcoming limitations in existing FL techniques. The model-agnostic optimization of "dreams" offers new capabilities for collaborative learning in domains with heterogeneous systems and strict privacy requirements.
