# [Randomness Is All You Need: Semantic Traversal of Problem-Solution   Spaces with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of exploring innovation problem and solution spaces in order to generate creative ideas. Typically, innovators struggle to systematically traverse prior innovations to find inspiration for new ideas. Manual searches are limited and reviewing previous works is time-consuming. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on an internal database of prior innovations to map problem statements to solution statements and vice versa. By semantically traversing this bi-directional tree of problems and solutions, they generate related and refined problem statements which can spark creative ideation.

Key aspects of the solution:

- Fine-tune LLMs to learn problem-to-solution and solution-to-problem mappings 
- Control semantic traversal and idea exploration using temperature tuning of LLMs
- Recursively traverse the tree by mapping problems to solutions and solutions back to problems 
- At each step, also retrieve nearest-neighbor problems from the database
- Flexibly traverse depth and breadth of tree to ideate on related concepts

Key Results:
- Show LLMs can maintain semantic fidelity in mapping problems to solutions and back
- Demonstrate increasing novelty and creativity of generated text with higher temperature 
- Develop algorithm and Python API for automated or user-guided traversal
- Implement interactive Slackbot to demonstrate real-world application

Main Contributions:
- Novel method for using LLMs to traverse and expand on problem/solution spaces 
- Techniques to control semantic diversity and creativity via temperature and traversal
- Application to innovation ideation and refinement of problem statements
- Proof-of-concept integration with Slack to assist real innovators

In summary, the paper presents a way to leverage LLMs to explore chains of related innovations in order to ideate on creative solutions or refinements to problems. Both the technical approach and real-world applicability to supporting innovators are key contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel approach to exploring innovation problem and solution domains using large language model fine-tuning with a custom idea database to semantically traverse bi-directional problem-solution spaces at different temperature levels, achieving high diversity in solution edit distance while remaining close to the original problem statement semantically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel approach to exploring innovation problem and solution domains using large language model (LLM) fine-tuning with a custom idea database. Specifically:

- They propose semantically traversing a bi-directional problem and solution tree at different temperature levels to achieve high diversity in solution edit distance while still remaining close to the original problem statement semantically. This allows finding a variety of solutions to a given problem as well as refining and clarifying the problem statement.

- They demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation by creating a Slack bot innovation assistant that can explore related problems and solutions to a given problem using fine-tuned LLMs. 

- They evaluate their approach on a dataset of company problem/solution descriptions, showing the model can maintain semantic fidelity when traversing the solution and problem spaces. They also show temperature plays a role in controlling the semantic deviation.

In summary, the main contribution is using fine-tuned LLMs for targeted idea exploration and semantic traversal of custom innovation problem/solution domains to assist human innovators.
