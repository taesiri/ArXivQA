# [Propagate And Calibrate: Real-time Passive Non-line-of-sight Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to perform real-time passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) tracking of a moving object or person using only a camera observing a relay wall, without any active illumination or additional equipment. 

Specifically, the key questions/goals are:

- How can we extract useful motion and position information from the subtle changes in the relay wall images over time as a person moves in the hidden scene?

- How can we effectively leverage both dynamic (motion) and static (position) information from the video frames for accurate and stable NLOS tracking?

- How can we integrate motion continuity priors into the tracking algorithm to get coherent trajectories instead of jittery frame-by-frame locations? 

- How can we build a network that propagates and calibrates latent states using raw frames and difference frames in an alternating manner for robust tracking?

- How to create a realistic dataset with ground truth trajectories to support research on this task?

In summary, this paper introduces a new purely passive NLOS tracking method called PAC-Net, which processes difference frames and raw frames in alternation to leverage motion and position messages. It also provides a new dataset of passive NLOS videos to facilitate future research.
