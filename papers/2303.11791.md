# [Propagate And Calibrate: Real-time Passive Non-line-of-sight Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to perform real-time passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) tracking of a moving object or person using only a camera observing a relay wall, without any active illumination or additional equipment. 

Specifically, the key questions/goals are:

- How can we extract useful motion and position information from the subtle changes in the relay wall images over time as a person moves in the hidden scene?

- How can we effectively leverage both dynamic (motion) and static (position) information from the video frames for accurate and stable NLOS tracking?

- How can we integrate motion continuity priors into the tracking algorithm to get coherent trajectories instead of jittery frame-by-frame locations? 

- How can we build a network that propagates and calibrates latent states using raw frames and difference frames in an alternating manner for robust tracking?

- How to create a realistic dataset with ground truth trajectories to support research on this task?

In summary, this paper introduces a new purely passive NLOS tracking method called PAC-Net, which processes difference frames and raw frames in alternation to leverage motion and position messages. It also provides a new dataset of passive NLOS videos to facilitate future research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes and formulates the purely passive NLOS tracking task, which avoids the use of expensive active illumination equipment. This could enable promising and valuable applications in fields like robotic vision and medical imaging. 

2. It proposes PAC-Net, a network architecture that is capable of utilizing both dynamic and static visual information from raw frames and difference frames in an alternating manner. This allows it to maintain good trajectory continuity and achieve high tracking accuracy.

3. It introduces difference frames as carriers of clean motion information that avoids introducing extra noise from other time periods.

4. It establishes the first passive NLOS trajectory tracking dataset called NLOS-Track. This contains thousands of video clips with varied realistic scene settings to facilitate research on passive NLOS tracking.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing the passive NLOS tracking task, the PAC-Net architecture that leverages both motion and position cues, the use of difference frames, and the creation of a new dataset to enable further research in this area. The method is shown to achieve good real-time tracking accuracy on realistic indoor scenes.
