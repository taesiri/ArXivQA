# [Propagate And Calibrate: Real-time Passive Non-line-of-sight Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to perform real-time passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) tracking of a moving object or person using only a camera observing a relay wall, without any active illumination or additional equipment. 

Specifically, the key questions/goals are:

- How can we extract useful motion and position information from the subtle changes in the relay wall images over time as a person moves in the hidden scene?

- How can we effectively leverage both dynamic (motion) and static (position) information from the video frames for accurate and stable NLOS tracking?

- How can we integrate motion continuity priors into the tracking algorithm to get coherent trajectories instead of jittery frame-by-frame locations? 

- How can we build a network that propagates and calibrates latent states using raw frames and difference frames in an alternating manner for robust tracking?

- How to create a realistic dataset with ground truth trajectories to support research on this task?

In summary, this paper introduces a new purely passive NLOS tracking method called PAC-Net, which processes difference frames and raw frames in alternation to leverage motion and position messages. It also provides a new dataset of passive NLOS videos to facilitate future research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes and formulates the purely passive NLOS tracking task, which avoids the use of expensive active illumination equipment. This could enable promising and valuable applications in fields like robotic vision and medical imaging. 

2. It proposes PAC-Net, a network architecture that is capable of utilizing both dynamic and static visual information from raw frames and difference frames in an alternating manner. This allows it to maintain good trajectory continuity and achieve high tracking accuracy.

3. It introduces difference frames as carriers of clean motion information that avoids introducing extra noise from other time periods.

4. It establishes the first passive NLOS trajectory tracking dataset called NLOS-Track. This contains thousands of video clips with varied realistic scene settings to facilitate research on passive NLOS tracking.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing the passive NLOS tracking task, the PAC-Net architecture that leverages both motion and position cues, the use of difference frames, and the creation of a new dataset to enable further research in this area. The method is shown to achieve good real-time tracking accuracy on realistic indoor scenes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a passive non-line-of-sight tracking method called PAC-Net that utilizes difference frames to extract motion information and alternates between propagating and calibrating the hidden state using raw frames and difference frames to achieve coherent, accurate real-time tracking of humans walking in unseen rooms.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) tracking:

- Most prior NLOS tracking methods rely on active illumination like lasers or pulsed light. This paper proposes a purely passive approach using only ambient illumination and a conventional RGB camera. This avoids the need for specialized equipment.  

- Many previous papers focused on simplified experimental setups with static scenes or objects. This paper tackles more realistic dynamic scenes with humans walking in unknown indoor environments. The new NLOS-Track dataset reflects this.

- A lot of prior work locates objects independently per frame without considering motion continuity over time. This can cause jittery trajectories. This paper introduces difference frames and the PAC-Net architecture to leverage both motion and positional information for smoother tracking.

- Existing passive NLOS methods often use background subtraction, which can introduce extraneous noise. The local difference frames in this paper provide cleaner motion signals without mixing in other temporal information.

- Most NLOS tracking datasets are focused on active imaging modalities. The NLOS-Track dataset provides more realistic passive tracking data.

Overall, this paper pushes passive NLOS tracking towards more practical real-world conditions compared to previous controlled settings. The proposed methods and dataset enable tracking humans in unseen dynamic environments using only ambient illumination. This could open up new applications in areas like security, autonomous vehicles, etc.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the method to 3D tracking in more diverse real-world scenes. The current work focuses on 2D indoor tracking, but the authors suggest expanding it to 3D settings like autonomous driving, which would require collecting and labeling more complex 3D data. 

- Extending the method to multi-object tracking. The current pipeline focuses on single object tracking. The authors mention that analyzing multi-object tracking will be more difficult as the motion information does not combine linearly.

- Developing self-supervised or semi-supervised techniques. The authors suggest that developing techniques like this could help improve the generalization ability of models for NLOS tracking.

- Exploring different components like feature extractors, RNN cells, etc. The current work focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of the overall PAC-Net architecture rather than optimizing individual components. The authors suggest further exploration of different choices for these components.

- Improving realism and diversity of datasets. The authors created a new dataset NLOS-Track but mention there are still limitations in terms of realism and diversity. Expanding the data could further facilitate data-driven passive NLOS techniques.

In summary, the main future directions revolve around expanding the method to more complex 3D scenes, multi-object tracking, using self/semi-supervised learning to improve generalization, exploring model components, and continuing to improve the datasets. The core ideas seem to be increasing real-world applicability and leveraging data-driven techniques.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a purely passive method to track a person walking in an invisible room by only observing a relay wall with an RGB camera, without any additional equipment.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) tracking method to reconstruct trajectories of moving objects outside the line-of-sight using only a conventional RGB camera. The key idea is to leverage both dynamic motion information and static position information from the video of a relay wall to perform accurate and continuous tracking. 

The authors first introduce difference frames which represent temporally local motion information by subtracting consecutive raw frames. Then they propose PAC-Net, consisting of Propagation and Calibration cells, to process difference and raw frames alternately. This allows integrating motion continuity priors into the tracking algorithm. PAC-Net can achieve centimeter-level precision in real-time tracking. The authors also build the NLOS-Track dataset with over 1500 video clips to facilitate research in this area. Both synthetic and real data are included with paired wall videos and ground truth trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the value of using both motion and position information for passive NLOS tracking.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) tracking method called PAC-Net that can track the trajectory of a person walking in a hidden room by only observing subtle changes in the diffuse reflection on a visible relay wall. PAC-Net introduces 'difference frames' which are obtained by subtracting consecutive raw video frames and convey motion information. It then processes the raw frames and difference frames in an alternating manner through its Propagation-Cell and Calibration-Cell modules. The Propagation-Cell propagates the hidden state using the motion information from difference frames while the Calibration-Cell calibrates the state using positional information from raw frames. This alternating workflow allows PAC-Net to maintain continuity and accuracy in tracking. PAC-Net is trained end-to-end on video clips paired with ground truth trajectories. It achieves centimeter-level precision in tracking humans walking in unseen indoor scenes using only a conventional RGB camera without any active illumination or additional equipment.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of passively tracking the trajectory of a moving object or person in a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario, where the object is occluded from the camera's direct view. The key questions the paper aims to tackle are:

- How to perform real-time NLOS tracking of a moving object using only passive illumination (no active lighting like lasers)? This avoids the need for expensive equipment.

- How to effectively leverage both dynamic motion information and static position information for accurate tracking from only subtle changes in the observed images?
