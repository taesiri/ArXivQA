# [FemtoDet: An Object Detection Baseline for Energy Versus Performance   Tradeoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06719)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How to design an object detection model that achieves a good tradeoff between energy efficiency and performance for deployment on edge devices? 

The key points are:

- Most prior work on efficient object detection focuses on reducing parameters or speeding up inference time, which are not well correlated with energy efficiency. 

- The authors systematically analyze various CNN components like activation functions, convolution operators, and feature fusion structures to identify what impacts energy cost.

- They propose a lightweight detector called FemtoDet that is designed for energy efficiency using their findings.

- To further improve FemtoDet, they propose an instance boundary enhancement module and a recursive warm restart training strategy. 

- Experiments show FemtoDet can achieve competitive performance on VOC and other datasets with very low energy cost and high inference speed on a CPU.

So in summary, the main research goal is to develop an object detector tailored for energy-constrained edge devices by carefully designing the model architecture and training strategy. Energy efficiency is the key optimization criteria rather than just parameter size or latency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides guidelines for designing low-energy architectures for object detection models by exploring the energy costs of various CNN components like activation functions, convolution operators, and detector necks. 

2. It proposes a lightweight and low-energy object detection baseline called FemtoDet that is built using the identified energy-efficient components. FemtoDet has only 68.77k parameters and 1.1W power consumption.

3. To improve the optimization capability of lightweight models like FemtoDet, it introduces two techniques:

- An instance boundary enhancement (IBE) module that improves convolution optimization by capturing object boundary cues to overcome feature obfuscation caused by limited model capacity.

- A recursive warm restart (RecWR) training strategy that helps escape suboptimal solutions by gradually reducing augmentation strength across training stages.

4. Experiments on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and TJU-DHD datasets demonstrate that FemtoDet optimized with IBE and RecWR achieves competitive detection performance compared to other state-of-the-art lightweight detectors, while having significantly lower energy consumption.

In summary, the key contribution is providing systematized guidelines and optimizations to develop high-performance yet extremely efficient object detectors suitable for edge devices with strict energy constraints. The proposed FemtoDet serves as a strong baseline for future energy-oriented detector design.
