# [FemtoDet: An Object Detection Baseline for Energy Versus Performance   Tradeoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06719)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How to design an object detection model that achieves a good tradeoff between energy efficiency and performance for deployment on edge devices? 

The key points are:

- Most prior work on efficient object detection focuses on reducing parameters or speeding up inference time, which are not well correlated with energy efficiency. 

- The authors systematically analyze various CNN components like activation functions, convolution operators, and feature fusion structures to identify what impacts energy cost.

- They propose a lightweight detector called FemtoDet that is designed for energy efficiency using their findings.

- To further improve FemtoDet, they propose an instance boundary enhancement module and a recursive warm restart training strategy. 

- Experiments show FemtoDet can achieve competitive performance on VOC and other datasets with very low energy cost and high inference speed on a CPU.

So in summary, the main research goal is to develop an object detector tailored for energy-constrained edge devices by carefully designing the model architecture and training strategy. Energy efficiency is the key optimization criteria rather than just parameter size or latency.
