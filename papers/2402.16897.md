# [Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most previous multi-view learning methods assume the data across views is strictly aligned. However, real-world multi-view data often contains low-quality, conflictive instances that show inconsistent or conflicting information across views.  
- Previous methods mainly focus on eliminating the conflictive data, but real-world applications require making decisions for such data.
- The paper introduces a new problem setting called Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning (RCML) which requires providing decision results and attached reliabilities for conflictive multi-view instances.

Proposed Solution - Evidential Conflictive Multi-View Learning (ECML):

- View-specific Evidential DNNs collect "evidence" (support for each category) from each view. Evidence is used to construct "opinions" consisting of belief vector and reliability.

- A conflictive degree metric based on opinion entropy is proposed to measure conflicts between views. Minimizing this encourages consistency between views during training.  

- A novel conflictive opinion aggregation strategy is developed for fusion. It models relation between common and view-specific reliabilities. An average pooling layer implements the fusion.

- Theoretical analysis shows the uncertainty (inverse of reliability) increases when aggregating conflicting opinions, unlike most prior fusion methods where uncertainty always decreases after fusion.

Main Contributions:

- Identifying the importance of providing decisions and reliabilities for conflictive multi-view data.

- The proposed conflictive opinion aggregation strategy and accompanying proofs that show it can accurately model relation between multi-view common and view-specific reliabilities.

- Extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrating improved accuracy, reliability estimation and robustness over state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods.

In summary, the key novelty is appropriately handling conflictive data instead of eliminating it, by reliably fusing decisions and quantifying uncertainty from different views. Theoretical analysis and results validate effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Evidential Conflictive Multi-view Learning method that provides decision results and attached reliabilities for conflictive multi-view data by learning view-specific evidence, constructing view-specific opinions, and aggregating opinions through a conflictive fusion strategy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Recognizing the importance of explicitly providing decision results and associated reliabilities when dealing with conflicting multi-view data. This is formulated as the Reliable Conflictive Multi-view Learning (RCML) problem.

2. Developing a conflictive opinion aggregation strategy and theoretically proving it can exactly model the relation of multi-view common and view-specific reliabilities. 

3. Proposing the Evidential Conflictive Multi-view Learning (ECML) method to provide decisions and reliabilities for conflictive multi-view data. ECML first learns view-specific evidence using evidential DNNs. Then it constructs view-specific opinions and aggregates them via the proposed conflictive opinion aggregation.

4. Empirically evaluating ECML on 6 real-world datasets and showing it outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view learning baselines on accuracy, reliability and robustness.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the RCML problem and the ECML method to make reliable decisions for conflictive multi-view data by modeling view-specific reliabilities and their relations.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning (RCML): The paper introduces this new problem that requires providing decision results and attached reliabilities for conflictive multi-view data.

- Conflictive multi-view data: Real-world multi-view data that contains low-quality, conflicting instances that show inconsistent information across different views.  

- Evidential Conflictive Multi-View Learning (ECML): The proposed method to address the RCML problem by modeling view-specific opinions and reliabilities.

- View-specific evidence: The amount of support for each category collected from the data by view-specific models. Used to construct view-specific opinions.

- Conflictive opinion aggregation: A proposed aggregation strategy that models the relation between common and view-specific reliabilities. Increases uncertainty for conflictive instances.

- Conflictive degree: A measure introduced to quantify the conflict between opinions from different views. Used as a consistency loss.

- Decision reliability: The reliability score attached to the classification decisions to indicate how certain the model is, especially for conflictive instances.

The main focus is on making reliable classification decisions for multi-view data containing conflict, while properly quantifying the uncertainty. The key ideas include evidential modeling, conflictive opinion aggregation, and consistency enforcement.
