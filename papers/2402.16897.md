# [Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most previous multi-view learning methods assume the data across views is strictly aligned. However, real-world multi-view data often contains low-quality, conflictive instances that show inconsistent or conflicting information across views.  
- Previous methods mainly focus on eliminating the conflictive data, but real-world applications require making decisions for such data.
- The paper introduces a new problem setting called Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning (RCML) which requires providing decision results and attached reliabilities for conflictive multi-view instances.

Proposed Solution - Evidential Conflictive Multi-View Learning (ECML):

- View-specific Evidential DNNs collect "evidence" (support for each category) from each view. Evidence is used to construct "opinions" consisting of belief vector and reliability.

- A conflictive degree metric based on opinion entropy is proposed to measure conflicts between views. Minimizing this encourages consistency between views during training.  

- A novel conflictive opinion aggregation strategy is developed for fusion. It models relation between common and view-specific reliabilities. An average pooling layer implements the fusion.

- Theoretical analysis shows the uncertainty (inverse of reliability) increases when aggregating conflicting opinions, unlike most prior fusion methods where uncertainty always decreases after fusion.

Main Contributions:

- Identifying the importance of providing decisions and reliabilities for conflictive multi-view data.

- The proposed conflictive opinion aggregation strategy and accompanying proofs that show it can accurately model relation between multi-view common and view-specific reliabilities.

- Extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrating improved accuracy, reliability estimation and robustness over state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods.

In summary, the key novelty is appropriately handling conflictive data instead of eliminating it, by reliably fusing decisions and quantifying uncertainty from different views. Theoretical analysis and results validate effectiveness.
