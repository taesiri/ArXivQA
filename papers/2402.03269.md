# [ISPA: Inter-Species Phonetic Alphabet for Transcribing Animal Sounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional bioacoustics analysis relies on spectrograms and continuous audio representations, lacking interpretability and conciseness. 
- Onomatopoeia used for transcribing animal sounds is inconsistent across languages and cultures.
- There is a lack of standardized systems for precisely and concisely transcribing animal sounds into text.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ISPA (Inter-Species Phonetic Alphabet), a system for transcribing animal sounds into concise, interpretable text representations. 
- Two approaches are explored - ISPA-A (acoustics-based) and ISPA-F (feature-based).
- ISPA-A relies on pitch detection and a Viterbi algorithm to encode pitch, timbre, duration and pitch slope changes.  
- ISPA-F discretizes audio feature representations like MFCCs and AVES using k-means and maps them to human-readable phonemes.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a standardized transcription system, ISPA, for animal sounds, achieving precision, conciseness and interpretability.
- Demonstration that ISPA representations can be effectively used for bioacoustic classification tasks, achieving accuracy comparable to methods using continuous representations.
- Exploration of using pre-trained language models like RoBERTa for bioacoustics by treating ISPA as a "foreign language", showing performance boosts from fine-tuning.
- Opening possibilities for using ISPA for various downstream tasks like detection, captioning, generation etc by representing animal sounds as text.

In summary, the paper proposes ISPA to transcribe animal sounds into textual representations that balance precision, conciseness and interpretability. Experiments show ISPA can match baseline accuracy in bioacoustic tasks while enabling diverse future applications.
