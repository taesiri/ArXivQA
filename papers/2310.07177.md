# [Online Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07177)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- How can we improve the performance of speculative decoding for large language model (LLM) inference by adapting the smaller "draft" models dynamically based on the query distribution? 

- The paper hypothesizes that continuously retraining the draft models on user query data can enhance their ability to emulate the target LLM's outputs for that query distribution. This would improve the token acceptance rate and reduce latency.

- It also hypothesizes that the abundant spare computational resources in typical LLM serving clusters can be repurposed to retrain the draft models online at low cost.

- The paper explores whether adapting multiple draft models, each tailored to a different query distribution mode (e.g. language or topic), can further improve performance.

- More broadly, the paper introduces and evaluates a framework called "online speculative decoding" that aims to reduce LLM serving latency by dynamically adapting draft models using query data and knowledge distillation. It hypothesizes this approach can effectively handle shifts in query distributions.

In summary, the key hypotheses are around using online learning and spare resources to tailor draft models to the query distribution, in order to improve speculative decoding performance and reduce LLM serving latency. The paper explores these hypotheses through algorithm development, analysis, and experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new method called "online speculative decoding" to reduce the latency of large language model (LLM) inference. 

2. It proposes to continuously update/retrain smaller "draft" models on-the-fly using user query data and knowledge distillation. The key ideas are:

- Leverage the abundant spare FLOPs in a typical LLM serving cluster to retrain the draft models with negligible overhead.

- Retraining the draft models on the query distribution makes them better at predicting the target LLM's outputs for similar queries, thus improving the token acceptance rate.

- As draft models evolve online, they can adapt to shifts in the query distribution.

3. It develops a prototype system and evaluates it on both synthetic and real-world queries. The results demonstrate significant improvements in token acceptance rates, translating to 1.2-3x lower latency.

4. It explores various generalized knowledge distillation (GKD) methods for training draft models and finds the most effective variants. It suggests GKD as a superior alternative to existing finetuning techniques. 

5. Overall, the method provides a practical solution to reduce LLM serving latency by adapting draft models online using spare resources available in the serving infrastructure. The ability to handle distribution shifts and negligible overhead are notable advantages.

In summary, the core contribution is an online learning framework to dynamically construct and evolve smaller draft models that can more accurately speculate the outputs of target LLMs based on observed queries. This ultimately helps accelerate LLM inference.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of language model inference optimization:

- This paper focuses specifically on speculative decoding, which is an emerging technique to accelerate inference in large language models (LLMs) by using a smaller draft model to propose possible tokens that are verified by the larger target model in parallel. Other optimizations like pipelining, pruning, knowledge distillation etc. aim to improve different aspects of LLM inference. So this paper explores a quite distinct approach.

- Within the realm of speculative decoding, most prior works like Leviathan and SpecInfer assume a static draft model after deployment. A key novelty of this paper is introducing a framework to dynamically adapt the draft model in an online setting based on observed user queries, irrespective of how the draft model was constructed. This allows the draft model to stay aligned with shifts in query distribution.

- For adapting the draft model online, the paper proposes a method based on online knowledge distillation, where the target LLM acts as the teacher and draft LLM as the student. It explores different distillation objectives like forward/reverse KL divergence to maximize accuracy. Most prior speculative decoding papers use plain fine-tuning objectives. Using distillation is more effective since it transfers richer information.

- A core motivation of the paper is leveraging spare FLOPs available in LLM serving clusters for online draft model updates. Since LLM inference is memory-bound, there is ample unused compute that can be repurposed with little overhead. The computational analysis quantifies this. 

- Results on both synthetic and real-world LLM query datasets demonstrate significant gains in token acceptance rates and lower latency from online adaptation of draft models. The gains match or surpass offline upper bounds.

In summary, introducing online adaptation of draft models in speculative decoding via online distillation is a novel contribution distinguishing this paper from prior art. The motivation of harnessing spare flops is also unique and empirically validated.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring optimal eviction/retention strategies for the replay buffer Q to maintain a compact size while retaining the most useful information for updating the draft model. The authors mention determining the best strategy as an area for future work.

- Finding the optimal combination of distance measure (e.g. forward KL vs reverse KL) and sampling method (teacher, student, mixed) for training the draft model, as the best approach seems to vary based on the task and models. The authors suggest this as an area for further exploration.

- Evaluating the efficacy of maintaining multiple draft models, each tailored to a particular query distribution mode or cluster. The authors propose this as a way to further reduce latency but leave a detailed investigation to future work.

- Conducting experiments on a wider range of large language models, tasks, and datasets to better understand the general applicability of the approach. The current study focuses on a few representative models and datasets.

- Exploring computational and memory optimizations for the online retraining of draft models to further minimize the overhead. The authors currently demonstrate the overhead is negligible but more optimizations could help.

- Investigating techniques to automatically determine the best update interval I based on system load, traffic patterns, and rate of distribution shift. The authors currently use a fixed interval.

- Extending the approach to conditional generation tasks beyond standard language modeling. The current work focuses on unconditional text generation.

In summary, the authors propose several interesting avenues, including exploring optimizations of the core approach, applying it to broader settings, and conducting more comprehensive experiments to better understand its capabilities and limitations. These directions could further enhance the efficacy and versatility of online speculative decoding.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces online speculative decoding, a novel method to reduce the latency of large language model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding uses a smaller draft model to predict multiple tokens of a larger target model in parallel. However, existing methods have limited accuracy on diverse inputs. The key idea of online speculative decoding is to continuously retrain the draft model on user queries, leveraging the abundant spare computing capacity available in LLM serving clusters. Since LLM inference is memory-bounded, the surplus compute can be repurposed for draft model updates with negligible overhead. Retraining on the query distribution enables the draft model to more accurately emulate the target model for those queries. Online updating also allows the draft model to adapt to distribution shifts in real time. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating significant improvements in token acceptance rate and inference latency reduction, without additional expense.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel method called online speculative decoding to reduce the latency of large language model (LLM) serving. LLM serving latency is high because generating each word requires serial evaluations of the LLM. Speculative decoding is an emerging technique that uses a smaller draft model to speculate multiple output tokens for a large target LLM in parallel, which the target LLM then verifies. However, if verification fails, the target LLM must recompute from that point, so the performance depends on the speculation accuracy. Existing methods have low accuracy on diverse text inputs due to the capability gap between draft and target models. 

The proposed online speculative decoding method leverages the abundant spare computational resources available in LLM serving clusters to continuously retrain multiple draft models on user query data seen so far. This aligns the draft models with the target LLM for inputs from the query distribution. Online retraining enables adaptation to shifts in the query distribution over time. A new online learning algorithm based on knowledge distillation is developed to update draft models opportunistically using spare resources. Experiments on synthetic and real-world query data show substantial increases in token acceptance rate, translating to lower latency. The method surpasses existing approaches using static draft models, approaching accuracy as if all query data were available a priori.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces online speculative decoding to reduce the latency of large language model (LLM) inference. The key idea is to continuously update one or more small "draft" models on-the-fly during LLM serving based on observed user queries, using online knowledge distillation. This leverages the abundant spare computation available in LLM serving clusters, since LLM inference is memory-bounded. Online updating enables the draft models to closely emulate the target LLM's outputs for the specific query distribution seen so far. As draft models evolve online, they effectively adapt to shifts in the query distribution over time. For distillation, the paper explores various divergence measures like KL and reverse KL and identifies effective variants. Overall, online updating of draft models is shown to significantly enhance token acceptance rates compared to methods relying on static draft models, translating to lower latency.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is the high latency of large language model (LLM) inference, which is a bottleneck for deploying LLMs in applications that demand low latency like search, chatbots, and virtual assistants. 

The paper identifies that a key reason for the high latency is that serving a user query requires running the LLM serially, generating one token at a time. This serial token generation incurs repeated memory access to the LLM weights and past tokens.

To address this problem, the paper proposes a novel method called "online speculative decoding" that aims to reduce LLM serving latency. The key ideas behind this method are:

1) Leverage the abundant spare computational resources ("spare flops") available in LLM serving clusters to continuously retrain smaller "draft" models on the query distribution using online learning.

2) The draft models are tuned to emulate the target LLM's outputs specifically on the observed queries, rather than on arbitrary diverse inputs. This is based on the observation that user queries to a specific LLM service often follow a domain-specific distribution.

3) The draft models evolve dynamically via online retraining, allowing them to adapt to shifts in the query distribution over time.

4) Using the draft models for speculative decoding of tokens in parallel is intended to reduce the memory bandwidth bottleneck of serial token generation in the target LLM.

In summary, the paper introduces an online learning approach to train draft models that are specialized to the query distribution, in order to improve speculative decoding and reduce LLM serving latency. The online tuning of draft models aims to mitigate the accuracy limitations of prior speculative decoding methods that use static draft models.
