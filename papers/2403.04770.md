# [Social Orientation: A New Feature for Dialogue Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting whether a conversation will succeed or fail is important in many real-world scenarios like customer service, business negotiations, and government discussions. 
- Existing methods for this task lack explainability or generalization capabilities across languages and low-resource settings.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce social orientation tags from psychology's Circumplex theory to model speakers' interaction styles (e.g. Warm-Agreeable, Arrogant-Calculating).
- Create a dataset labeling 30K dialogue utterances from Wikipedia with social orientation tags using GPT-4. 
- Train a distilled student model to predict social orientation tags from text.
- Incorporate predicted tags as features in neural models and logistic regression for dialogue outcome prediction.

Main Contributions:
1) Release social orientation labeled dialogue dataset and distilled tag prediction model.
2) Achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by using social orientation features in neural models for English benchmarks. 
3) Construct a Chinese dialogue outcome prediction dataset and show tags boost performance.  
4) Demonstrate tags make models more explainable by changing predictions based on theoretical assumptions of tag interactions.
5) Show logistic regression with only social orientation features beats Transformers in low-resource regimes.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel set of theoretical features from psychology to advance dialogue outcome prediction across languages, resource levels, accuracy, and explainability. The analysis of social orientation tags provides new insights into modeling and interpreting conversational dynamics.
