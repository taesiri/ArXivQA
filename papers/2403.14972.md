# [A Picture Is Worth a Graph: Blueprint Debate on Graph for Multimodal   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal reasoning methods rely heavily on few-shot learning or supervision to guide the reasoning process. This makes zero-shot learning difficult. 
- Multi-agent debate (MAD) can allow models to figure out the reasoning direction autonomously through discussion. But MAD suffers from two key challenges when applied to multimodal reasoning:
    1) Trivialization of opinions: Excessive summarization leads to shifting debate focus to more general concepts rather than specific ones relevant for answering the question. 
    2) Focus diversion: Distractor concepts introduced from images divert attention causing loss of focus on pertinent concepts.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Blueprint Debate on Graph (BDoG) which takes a deductive reasoning approach to address the above challenges. 
- BDoG starts by aggregating concepts from modalities into an initial graph. This graph serves as a blueprint, confining scope of discussion to relevant semantics.  
- BDoG conducts debate in a top-down manner by marking conclusions on the graph. This retains specificity and prevents trivialization.
- New concepts are stored in graph branches instead of context. This reduces distraction from irrelevant concepts.
- Graph provides high-level guidance for discussion and competition occurs at branch level rather than word level.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of multi-agent debate into multimodal reasoning
- Proposal of BDoG to address challenges of opinion trivialization and focus diversion
- BDoG achieves new SOTA results on ScienceQA and MMBench benchmarks
- Analysis of BDoG shows it effectively concentrates reasoning, improves efficiency and outperforms vanilla multi-agent debate

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution in advancing multimodal reasoning through a structured deductive debate approach that surmounts limitations of current inductive methods.
