# [Conversational Question Answering with Reformulations over Knowledge   Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of conversational question answering (ConvQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs). ConvQA involves answering a sequence of natural language questions in a conversational format using the information contained in a KG. A key challenge is that follow-up questions are often ambiguous or incomplete without the context, making them hard to interpret. This hinders the performance of existing ConvQA systems over KGs.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new model called \myModel that utilizes question reformulation and reinforcement learning to address the ambiguity in conversational QA. Specifically:

1. It uses pre-trained language models GPT-2 and BART to generate reformulations of the ambiguous questions. This makes the questions more complete and unambiguous.

2. It employs a teacher-student framework where the teacher model learns representations of questions using human-written reformulations, while the student model tries to mimic the teacher's outputs using the LLM-generated reformulations. This helps the student model achieve near human-level performance.

3. It formulates the QA task as a reinforcement learning problem over the KG. A policy network walks over the KG to find candidate answer entities. Rewards guide the walk.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates that although LLMs can reformulate questions well, their performance lags behind human reformulations.

- Proposes the \myModel model that uses a teacher-student framework and reinforcement learning over KGs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on ConvQA.

- Extensive experiments show that \myModel outperforms existing ConvQA baselines on several datasets. The framework is efficient and shows the efficacy of using reformulations.

In summary, the key novelty is using teacher-student learning and reinforcement learning in an innovative way along with question reformulation to advance the state-of-the-art in conversational QA over knowledge graphs. The proposed \myModel model outperforms previous baselines on benchmark datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a conversational question answering model called CoRnNet that uses a teacher-student architecture to learn question representations from human-written and machine-generated reformulations, and then applies reinforcement learning to walk on a knowledge graph to find answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Analysis: The paper demonstrates that although large language models (LLMs) can generate good question reformulations, their performance still lags behind human-level performance. 

2. Algorithm: The paper proposes a new model called CoRnNet that utilizes a teacher-student architecture and reinforcement learning over knowledge graphs to perform conversational question answering. The teacher model is trained on human-written reformulations while the student model tries to mimic the teacher's output using LLM-generated reformulations, allowing it to achieve near human-level performance.

3. Empirical Evaluation: Experiments on real-world conversational QA datasets show that CoRnNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

In summary, the key innovation is the teacher-student framework with LLM-generated reformulations to boost conversational QA performance to near human levels over knowledge graphs. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

The paper focuses on conversational question answering over knowledge graphs. It utilizes reinforcement learning and a teacher-student model with question reformulations generated by large language models to achieve better performance. The reformulations help address issues like anaphora and ellipsis that make conversational questions challenging. The teacher-student model helps the reformulations achieve near human-level performance. The RL agent navigates the knowledge graph, formulated as an MDP, using a learned policy network to find answers.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a teacher-student model to train the question encoder. Can you explain in more detail how this architecture works and why it is beneficial? What objectives or losses are used to train the student model?

3. Reinforcement learning is used to walk on the knowledge graph to find answers. Explain the details of the RL formulation - the action and state spaces, reward function, etc. How is the search process structured?

4. Soft rewards are used during RL training to mitigate sparsity and incomplete information in the knowledge graph. Can you elaborate on how these soft rewards are calculated? How do they help improve model training and performance?

6. Can you discuss in more detail the process of inferring topic entities between conversation turns? What classifier is used and what features does it take as input?

7. One limitation mentioned is performance on yes/no questions and questions about plot details. Can you suggest ways to improve performance on these types of questions?  

8. Could the proposed model be extended to a dialogue-based conversatial QA setting where natural language responses are required? What components would need modification?

9. How does the sample efficiency of this RL-based approach compare to supervised learning alternatives? Could you design experiments to analyze this?
