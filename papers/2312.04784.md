# [Reality's Canvas, Language's Brush: Crafting 3D Avatars from Monocular   Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04784)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ReCaLaB, a novel approach for creating editable 3D human avatars from monocular video. The key idea is to learn a disentangled neural texture field representing the human in a canonical T-pose. This is achieved through a pose-conditioned deformable NeRF that maps input pixels to the T-pose space using skeletal motion. Viewpoint-agnostic neural texture stacks are then generated representing separate albedo and shading components. This allows controlling appearance by modifying texture, shape, or lighting. A text-conditioned diffusion model enables intuitive manipulation by propagating gradients to freeze or unfreeze components. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art image quality surpassing even recent multi-view methods. The approach enables real-time editing of body shape, texture, and lighting through natural language. By democratizing avatar creation and editing, ReCaLaB represents a major advance towards customizable digital humans for the wider public. The disentangled canonical representation from monocular video, language-based control, and rendering quality are key technical innovations with substantial impact.
