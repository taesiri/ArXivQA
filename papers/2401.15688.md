# [Divide and Conquer: Language Models can Plan and Self-Correct for   Compositional Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15688)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing text-to-image generation methods struggle to ensure controllability over the generated images when given complex text prompts containing multiple objects with different attributes or relationships. They fail to accurately generate images that align with the text descriptions, especially in terms of retaining correct object attributes and relationships.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes CompAgent, a training-free approach for compositional text-to-image generation. It adopts a divide-and-conquer methodology coordinated by a large language model (LLM) agent.

The key ideas are:
1) The LLM agent decomposes the complex text prompt into individual objects, extracts their attributes, and predicts a scene layout.  
2) The agent then conquers the individual objects separately using existing models to generate images of each object.
3) Next, guided by the layout, the agent employs and composes external tools to generate the final image with all objects:
   - Tuning-free multi-concept customization tool to ensure object attributes
   - Layout-to-image generation tool to represent relationships
   - Local image editing tool to correct erroneous attributes
4) The agent can further verify and refine the images using vision models and human feedback.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes CompAgent, an LLM agent based framework to address compositional text-to-image generation through divide-and-conquer.
2) Designed a tuning-free multi-concept customization model with layout control to solve attribute binding.
3) Demonstrated that layout-to-image manner can ensure fidelity of object relationships.  
4) Introduced verification and feedback into the agent for attribute error correction and image refinement.

Experiments show CompAgent achieves over 10% improvement on compositional text-to-image generation metrics compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The flexible extension to related applications like multi-concept image customization and editing also illustrates the capability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes CompAgent, a training-free approach for compositional text-to-image generation that employs an LLM agent to decompose complex text prompts, plan tool usage, verify outputs, and incorporate human feedback to conquer individual objects separately and then compose them into coherent images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes CompAgent, a training-free approach for compositional text-to-image generation based on the divide-and-conquer principle. The key component is a large language model (LLM) agent that oversees decomposition, reasoning, planning, tool use, verification and human feedback.

2. It introduces a tuning-free multi-concept image customization model by imposing global and local layout control to address the attribute binding problem. It also uses a layout-to-image generation model to ensure the faithfulness of object relationships.

3. It presents a verification and feedback mechanism for the LLM agent to identify and correct potential attribute errors in the generated images through local image editing tools. This allows further refinement of the images.

4. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompAgent achieves over 10% improvement on the T2I-CompBench benchmark and can flexibly extend to related tasks like multi-concept customization, reference-based image editing and object placement.

In summary, the key innovation is using an LLM agent to plan and coordinate a toolkit of models in a divide-and-conquer approach to address the challenges in compositional text-to-image generation.
