# [CLIPascene: Scene Sketching with Different Types and Levels of   Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17256)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we automatically generate abstract scene sketches with controllable levels of abstraction along the dimensions of visual simplicity and stroke precision?

The authors propose a method to generate abstract sketches of an input photograph with varying levels of abstraction. Their key idea is to control abstraction along two axes:

1. Visual simplicity: Gradually simplify the sketch by removing detail. This is done by optimizing a network to remove strokes while maintaining scene semantics.

2. Stroke precision: Control the level of detail and precision in the strokes. This is done by optimizing the network using different layers of a CLIP model which provide feature maps at different levels of abstraction.

The central hypothesis is that by controlling abstraction along these two axes, they can automatically generate sketch matrices that provide a smooth range of abstractions capturing both global scene structure and local precision detail. The paper presents both qualitative and quantitative experiments to evaluate the ability of their method to provide control over abstraction levels compared to prior sketch generation techniques.

In summary, the key research question is how to automatically generate controllable abstractions of scene sketches rather than just a single output sketch. The two axes of abstraction allow control over both the complexity of the scene semantics as well as the level of stroke precision detail.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new method for generating abstract scene sketches with controllable levels of abstraction along two separate axes:

1. Fidelity Axis: The paper presents a method to generate scene sketches at varying levels of detail and precision. This is achieved by training a neural network at different layers of a CLIP vision transformer model. Lower layers lead to more detailed sketches while higher layers result in looser, more abstract sketches.

2. Simplicity Axis: The paper proposes a technique to iteratively simplify an input sketch by balancing two loss functions - one that preserves semantics based on CLIP and one that encourages sparsity. By controlling the relative strengths of these losses, sketches with varying levels of visual simplification can be generated from a given input sketch.

So in summary, the key contribution is allowing control over both the fidelity and simplicity of generated scene sketches through the use of CLIP losses and iterative neural network training. This provides users more flexibility than prior sketch generation methods in producing a range of abstractions. The paper demonstrates this through both qualitative results and quantitative experiments.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method to generate sketch abstractions of an input image along two axes - visual simplicity and stroke precision - by training neural networks to iteratively simplify an initial detailed sketch based on losses that balance sketch sparseness and semantic similarity to the input image.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper presents a new method for generating abstract scene sketches with controllable abstraction along two axes - fidelity and simplicity. Most prior work has focused on only one axis of abstraction, usually simplification. Allowing control along two axes provides more flexibility.

- The technique uses a convolutional MLP to learn to generate sketch strokes, guided by CLIP losses. This is similar to prior work like Clipart StyleGAN and Clipasso that also train neural networks for abstract image generation using CLIP. The key difference is this paper uses scene decomposition and trains separate networks for foreground and background.

- For foreground sketching, this paper leverages ViT layers 2, 4, 7, and 8 for different levels of fidelity. Most prior work uses a single CLIP layer. Using multiple layers allows more precision in controlling abstraction level.

- For background sketching, this paper uses layers 2, 7, 8 and 11. Layer 11 leads to a very loose style not explored much before for scene sketching.

- For simplicity control, this paper gradually balances the CLIP loss against a stroke sparsity loss using an exponential schedule. Most prior work has focused only on sparsity. The exponential schedule enables smooth transitions between levels.

- For evaluation, this paper introduces a new automated recognizability metric using CLIP, in addition to human studies. Most prior work has only used human studies or fidelity metrics. The automated metric allows easier large-scale evaluation.

- Compared to other scene sketching papers, this method seems to allow finer control over abstraction style along the two axes. The evaluations also seem more extensive.

In summary, the key novelties compared to prior work are the use of multiple CLIP layers, exponential schedule for simplicity, and the automated recognizability metric. By better disentangling fidelity and simplicity, this method expands the abstraction space for sketch generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several promising future research directions in the conclusion section:

1. Exploring additional applications of the abstraction axis: The authors suggest their abstraction framework could be useful for other applications beyond just sketching, such as creating abstract art or simplifying vector graphics for technical illustrations and diagrams. They propose exploring these additional use cases in future work.

2. Generalizing the framework to other modalities: The current framework operates on image inputs. The authors propose exploring how a similar abstraction framework could be developed for other modalities like video, 3D shapes, or audio.

3. Exploring interactive or user-guided abstractions: The current method is fully automatic. The authors suggest it could be useful to develop interactive interfaces that allow a user to guide the abstraction process and incorporate human feedback.

4. Incorporating semantic guidance: The abstraction process currently relies only on visual information. Incorporating semantic guidance, for example by utilizing scene graphs or textual captions, could allow creating abstractions better tailored to conveying a specific meaning.

5. Studying human abstraction processes: The authors propose conducting perceptual studies to better understand how humans create and interpret visual abstractions. These insights could help improve automatic abstraction methods. 

In summary, the key future directions are exploring new applications, generalizing to new modalities, incorporating interactivity and human guidance, leveraging semantic information, and conducting studies on human abstraction. Developing the abstraction framework in these directions could greatly expand its capabilities and usefulness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new method for generating abstract scene sketches with controllable fidelity and simplicity. The key idea is to decompose the input scene into foreground object(s) and background regions using an off-the-shelf salient object detector. The foreground and background are then sketched separately by optimizing an MLP to generate sketch strokes based on a CLIP-guided loss. To control abstraction, sketches are generated using features from different layers of a CLIP ViT model, enabling control over fidelity. Simplicity is achieved by iteratively training the MLP with an additional loss to remove strokes. By sketching foreground and background independently, the method allows combining sketches from different abstraction levels, enabling applications like stroke stylization or artistic editing. Experiments demonstrate the approach produces recognizable sketches with smooth fidelity/simplicity axes compared to alternatives. The user study also shows sketches better capture semantics of input scenes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new deep learning-based method for generating abstract scene sketches with controllable levels of abstraction along two different axes: fidelity and simplicity. The key idea is to decompose the input scene into a foreground object and background region using an off-the-shelf saliency detector. The foreground and background are then sketched separately by training MLPs to output stroke locations and radiuses. The fidelity axis is controlled by using different layers of a CLIP model to guide the training process, with earlier layers leading to more abstract and loose sketches. The simplicity axis is achieved by iteratively re-training the MLPs using a loss function that balances sketch sparseness with CLIP feature similarity. This allows generating a series of simplified sketches in a gradual manner. A user study and quantitative experiments demonstrate the method's ability to produce recognizable and controllable abstractions.

In more detail, the paper makes the following key contributions: (1) A scene decomposition module to separate foreground and background. (2) Training of MLPs to generate sketch strokes for foreground and background guided by CLIP losses. (3) Use of different CLIP layers to control sketch fidelity. (4) An iterative simplification process using a parameterized loss balancing sparsity and CLIP similarity. (5) Quantitative experiments measuring fidelity and recognizability of the sketches using edge distance and CLIP zero-shot classification. (6) A user study evaluating the method's controllable abstractions compared to recent techniques. The core technical novelty lies in the iterative MLP training process and parameterized loss balancing sketch simplicity and semantics. Experiments demonstrate the benefits of foreground/background separation and show the method produces intuitive abstractions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a deep learning approach for generating sketch abstractions of an input image along two axes: fidelity and simplicity. The key idea is to train an MLP to optimize for two losses - one that matches the sketch content to the input image using CLIP embeddings (L_CLIP), and one that minimizes the number of strokes (L_sparse). To generate sketches at different fidelity levels, L_CLIP is computed using different layers of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained for image recognition. To control abstraction along the simplicity axis, the method trains the MLP multiple times, each time adjusting the relative weighting between L_CLIP and L_sparse to encourage stroke removal. This gradual simplification is achieved by defining an exponential relation between the two losses. The scene is first decomposed into foreground/background to allow specialized control over sketching each region. The method can generate a range of sketch abstractions that balance simplicity and fidelity.
