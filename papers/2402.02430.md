# [Exploiting Low-level Representations for Ultra-Fast Road Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing road segmentation methods for autonomous driving systems overlook a key characteristic - roads are "stuff" (background elements) rather than "things" (identifiable objects). Therefore, road pixels can be effectively classified using low-level features rather than high-level semantic features. However, prior works have not explored this and focus on heavyweight networks for feature extraction.  

Key Idea: 
The authors find the primary stage of ResNet-18 alone achieves 93.58% recall in segmenting roads, indicating low-level features are sufficient. But it suffers from false positives in weak texture areas. This motivates a lightweight bilateral network with:

(1) A spatial detail branch that uses the ResNet-18 stage 1 to extract high-resolution low-level road representations.

(2) A context semantic branch that quickly captures context for suppressing false positives. It uses asymmetric downsampling and a novel lightweight aggregation module for fast feature extraction.

(3) A selective fusion module that removes non-road areas from the low-level representation using spatial attention between the two branches.

Main Contributions:

- Revealing the "stuff" characteristic of roads which enables low-level feature-based segmentation, overlooked by prior arts.

- Proposing the LFD-RoadSeg network incorporating the above key ideas to achieve highly efficient and accurate road segmentation.

- Achieving state-of-the-art efficiency of 238 FPS on TITAN Xp and 54 FPS on Jetson TX2 with 95.21% MaxF on KITTI Road using only 936K parameters. This showcases 2x speedup over prior arts with comparable accuracy.

Therefore, this work makes road segmentation extremely efficient while retaining high accuracy, advancing its feasibility for embedded autonomous driving systems.
