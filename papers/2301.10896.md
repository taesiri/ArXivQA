# [Causal Reasoning of Entities and Events in Procedural Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10896)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

Can large language models effectively leverage causal reasoning about entities to better predict events in procedural texts?

More specifically, the key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Predicting entity state changes as an intermediate reasoning step will allow LLMs to better predict event likelihood changes in procedures (compared to directly predicting event changes).

2) Providing annotated entity state changes to LLMs will further improve their ability to predict event likelihood changes, if the models can properly leverage this causal information. 

3) Representing procedures and events in a structured, code-like format will allow LLMs (especially code-trained ones like Codex) to more effectively perform causal reasoning between entities and events.

In summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that explicit causal reasoning about entities can substantially improve LLMs' ability to make inferences about event plausibility in procedural texts, especially if represented properly in a structured format. The paper aims to demonstrate and analyze this through experiments on the proposed CREPE benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new task, dataset, and baselines for causal reasoning about events and entities in procedural texts (CREPE). The task involves predicting how the likelihood of hypothetical events changes after each step in a procedure. 

2. Showing that large language models like GPT-3 perform close to chance on this task, while a code-trained model (Codex) prompted with a novel code representation of procedures substantially outperforms GPT-3.

3. Demonstrating that prompting Codex to predict entity state changes as an intermediate "chain of thought" reasoning step further improves performance on predicting event likelihood changes. This shows the efficacy of chain-of-thought prompting and the benefit of lower-level entity information for higher-level event reasoning.

4. Experimenting with different ways to incorporate entity state information into the code prompt, including predicted states from the model itself or annotated states from the dataset. The annotated states lead to the best performance when encoded properly into the code.

5. Providing analysis showing the difficulty of this causal reasoning task, and that code-trained models can reason about complex temporal event and entity dynamics, even without explicit mentions of key entities.

In summary, the key ideas are introducing a new challenging task requiring causal reasoning about events and entities, showing limitations of standard LLMs, proposing innovations like code prompting and chain-of-thought to address the challenges, and analysis of the results. The overall contribution is advancing the capabilities of language models for this type of causal, multi-hop reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper: 

The paper proposes a new benchmark and models for causal reasoning about the likelihood of events in procedural texts by leveraging changes in related entity states as intermediate reasoning steps.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of causal reasoning about events and entities in procedural texts:

- This paper presents the first benchmark dataset (CREPE) focused specifically on causal reasoning between events and entities in procedural texts. Other datasets in this domain have tended to focus on either event reasoning or entity state tracking, but not the connection between the two. So this provides a new resource for studying this important causal link.

- The paper shows that large language models like GPT-3 perform close to chance on the CREPE dataset, lagging far behind human performance. This highlights the limitations of current LLMs for complex causal reasoning, even though they excel at many other NLP tasks. 

- To improve model performance, the authors propose novel code-like representations of procedures for prompting the Codex model. The code prompts are shown to be much more effective than natural language prompts for GPT-3 and other models. This demonstrates the promise of leveraging programming language knowledge in language models for logical and procedural reasoning.

- The paper introduces a new "chain of thought" prompting method to inject intermediate entity states into the code representations. This allows Codex to achieve state-of-the-art performance on CREPE by explicitly modeling the causal chain from entities to events. 

- Existing work on event and entity reasoning has not explored code prompting or explicitly modeling causal chains between events and entities. So these are novel techniques proposed in this paper.

- The chain of thought prompting builds on prior work on decomposition for multi-hop reasoning. But this paper is one of the first to bring that approach to code-trained models like Codex.

Overall, the key novelty seems to be in creatively prompting LLMs with code representations and causal reasoning chains tailored to this challenging task combining events and entities. The paper makes both empirical and conceptual contributions in advancing language modeling for procedural reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring related tasks such as next-event prediction, event temporal ordering, etc. by injecting relevant information about entities into their code representation. The authors mention their code representation allows for more powerful expressions than just entailment and negation.

- Exploring other forms of code chain-of-thought such as first-order logic. The authors state these expressions generated by LLMs could be computed objectively, improving interpretability and faithfulness.

- Applying their structured representation ideas to other models beyond Codex, which is currently the only code LM they test on. 

- Addressing the limitations of their dataset by creating larger and less biased datasets, exploring events that require reasoning about multiple entity states with complex logical relations.

- Extending their methods and findings on procedural texts to other text styles like stories or news, which may require domain adaptation.

- Further exploring the ability of code LMs like Codex to apply chain-of-thought and leveraging their strengths at structured representations.

In summary, the key future directions focus on expanding the tasks, textual domains, logics explored, dataset scale and diversity, and model capabilities especially around code LMs and chain-of-thought reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark task and dataset called CREPE for causal reasoning about events and entities in procedural texts. Procedural texts like recipes and instructions describe sequences of events that change the states of entities. The CREPE task involves predicting how the likelihood of hypothetical events changes after each step in a procedure. This requires reasoning about how the steps causally affect relevant entities. The authors create a dataset of 183 procedures with entity state changes and event likelihood changes annotated. They show that large language models like GPT-3 perform close to chance on this task. They propose representing the procedures as Python code and using the Codex model, which improves performance significantly. Further improvements come from prompting Codex to explicitly predict entity states as an intermediate reasoning step. The paper demonstrates the challenge of causal reasoning in procedural texts, and provides effective methods using code prompting and chain of thought prompting.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CREPE, a new benchmark task and dataset for causal reasoning about entities and events in procedural texts. Procedural texts describe sequences of events, such as recipes or instructions, where reasoning about hypothetical events often requires inferring implicit entity states. The CREPE dataset contains handcrafted examples of procedures along with labels indicating how the likelihood of hypothetical events changes after each step, based on implicit entity state changes. 

The authors experiment with various large language models including GPT-3 on this new task. They find all models perform close to chance, showing the challenge CREPE provides. They boost performance by representing the procedures as Python code and prompting the code-trained model Codex, which achieves 0.585 F1. Further improvements come from incorporating the annotated entity state changes into the code representation, allowing Codex to reason in a chain-of-thought. This representation also allows predicted or annotated entity states to be provided, with the annotated states leading to 0.715 F1 performance. The findings show the efficacy of code-like prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning for this causal, multi-hop task.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes CREPE, a new benchmark and approach for causal reasoning about event plausibility and entity states in procedural texts. The key method is representing the procedures as Python code and using the code language model Codex to predict event likelihood changes. The procedures are encoded as Python classes, with the goal as the class name, steps as comments, and hypothetical events as objects with a "change" attribute. Codex takes this code prompt and predicts the value of the "change" attribute to determine if an event becomes more/less likely after each step. The paper shows this code prompting method substantially outperforms standard language models like GPT-3. Furthermore, the code representation allows explicitly representing entity states, which are predicted by Codex or provided as ground truth. Adding entity states as intermediate reasoning steps in the code (chain-of-thought prompting) is shown to further improve Codex's performance on predicting event likelihood changes. Overall, the core innovation is leveraging both code prompting and explicit causal reasoning between events and entities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem and questions it is addressing are:

- Causal reasoning about events and entities in procedural texts. The paper proposes that reasoning about events in procedures requires models to first figure out the relevant entity attributes, infer their states based on context, and then predict the event. It hypothesizes that the causal relation between entity changes and events can help language models better perform event reasoning.

- Can language models benefit from first predicting entity state changes as an intermediate step before predicting event likelihood changes? 

- Can language models effectively leverage annotated entity state changes to better predict event likelihood changes?

- Do existing entity state tracking models make predictions that lead to better performance on the proposed task?

In summary, the main problem is how to perform effective causal reasoning about events and entities in procedural texts. The key questions examine whether providing information about entity states as an intermediate reasoning step can improve language models' ability to predict event likelihood changes. The paper introduces a new benchmark task and dataset to study these problems and questions.
