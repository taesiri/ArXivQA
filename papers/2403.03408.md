# [Scene Depth Estimation from Traditional Oriental Landscape Paintings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Estimating depth from traditional Oriental landscape paintings is extremely challenging due to:
1) Unique "three-way method" of depicting depth that does not follow perspective rules
2) Long history leading to multitude of stylistic variations  
3) Poor preservation with blurry edges and weak contrast
As a result, state-of-the-art depth estimation models fail on these paintings. 

Proposed Solution:
1) Use CLIP-based image matching to create dataset pairing Oriental paintings with semantically similar landscape photos. Carefully select dictionary of frequent objects in Oriental paintings.
2) Two-step image-to-image translation:
   - Step 1: CycleGAN to convert painting into pseudo-real scene image
   - Step 2: DiffuseIT to convert pseudo-real scene + painting into final real scene image
3) Apply pre-trained depth model (MiDaS) on generated real scene image

Key Contributions:
1) Novel framework with CLIP-based matching and two-step I2I translation to predict high-quality real scene image from Oriental painting for depth estimation
2) CLIP-based matching strategy and carefully constructed dictionary to obtain image pairs in absence of actual location photos
3) Qualitative and quantitative experiments showing framework effectively preserves structure while achieving realistic transformation for depth estimation
4) First method to estimate depth of traditional Oriental landscape paintings to assist visually impaired individuals in experiencing paintings

In summary, this paper proposes a strategy involving CLIP-based matching and two-step I2I translation to predict a real scene image from an Oriental painting that can enable depth estimation. This has the potential to help visually impaired people appreciate paintings through touch. The key novelty is the ability to obtain paired images and transform paintings for depth estimation despite unique challenges of Oriental art.
