# [Diffusion Models as Constrained Samplers for Optimization with Unknown   Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18012)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of optimization when explicit constraints are unavailable. While methods exist for handling unknown objective functions, there has been limited work on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not provided. Overlooking such constraints can lead to unrealistic or invalid solutions. 

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is to restrict the optimization search space to the manifold delineated by the training data, under the assumption that the data samples satisfy necessary feasibility constraints. This is achieved by reformulating the original constrained optimization problem as a sampling problem. Specifically, the target distribution to sample from is the product of (i) a Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and (ii) the density learned by a diffusion model trained on the dataset. As the temperature decreases, this distribution concentrates on the feasible minimizers.

A two-stage sampling framework is then proposed:
(i) A warm-up stage involving guided diffusion focused on the objective function. This provides initialization within the data manifold. 
(ii) A refinement stage using Langevin dynamics to accurately sample from the target density.

Main Contributions:
- Novel formulation of constrained optimization with unknown constraints as sampling from a product of experts. This elegantly combines optimizer and data distributions.
- Two-stage sampling procedure leveraging diffusion models and Langevin dynamics.
- Theoretical analysis proving that the guided diffusion stage yields a distribution concentrating on feasible minimizers.
- Experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrating superior or competitive performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, the paper develops an innovative sampling framework to address the open challenge of optimization under unknown constraints by restricting the search space using diffusion models trained on feasibility data.
