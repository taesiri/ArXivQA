# [Can Transformers Learn to Solve Problems Recursively?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Neural networks have shown promise for automating software tasks like program synthesis, repair, and verification. However, it's unclear to what degree they can effectively model program semantics needed for these tasks. In particular, structural recursion is important for representing data structures and emulating program behavior, but challenging for neural models. 

- This paper investigates whether transformer models can learn to approximate the behavior of structurally recursive functions from input-output examples. The goal is to understand the limitations of transformers in this area and analyze the "shortcut" algorithms they learn instead of true recursion.

Methods
- Two tasks are studied: the binary successor function over bit strings, and traversal of binary trees. Transformer encoder-decoder models are trained to map input sequences to output sequences representing evaluation of these recursive functions.

- Attention maps are visualized to reverse engineer model mechanisms. Perturbation analysis (e.g. flipping tokens) is used to further understand causes of model behavior. Conceptually, the model computations are analyzed as abstract state machines.

Results
- For binary successor, the model exhibits a specialized "recursion head" in attention maps that focuses on recursive cases. By reconstructing the learned algorithm via perturbations, the authors predict 91% of failure cases. The model relies more on positional encodings than token content.

- For tree traversal, the model struggles with full inorder traversal but learns tricks for preorder traversal by ignoring parentheses and non-value tokens. It uses attention to track parentheses to estimate depth. The model finds depth-specific shortcuts during traversal.

Conclusions
- The analysis shows transformers do not truly learn structural recursion. By reconstructing their approximate algorithms, the authors understand and predict where and why they fail. This sheds light on limitations of neural semantics for programming tasks. Analyses like perturbation and attention map reconstruction can drive future improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the ability of small transformer models to learn to emulate the behavior of structurally recursive functions from input-output examples, through empirical analysis and by reconstructing the "shortcut" algorithms the models learn, in order to understand where they fall short.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study and conceptual analysis to examine the behavior of transformer models in learning to approximate structurally recursive functions. Specifically, it makes the following key contributions:

1) It evaluates the ability of transformer models to learn to emulate the behavior of structurally recursive functions like the binary successor and tree traversals through an empirical study. The analysis includes different granularities and aspects of the model's behavior.

2) It provides a conceptual framework based on abstract state machines that allows analyzing the practical computation implemented by transformer models to approximate recursion. 

3) It reconstructs the mechanisms and algorithms learned by transformers in approximating the recursive tasks and identifies their flaws. Through algorithm reconstruction, the paper is able to correctly predict up to 91% of failure cases on the binary successor task. 

In summary, the key contribution is providing a comprehensive empirical and conceptual analysis to uncover and predict the limitations of transformers in learning structurally recursive functions. The paper enhances our understanding of why transformer models fail on the very tasks they are trained to solve.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Structural recursion - The paper examines how transformer models learn to approximate functions defined by structural recursion, which is recursion over data structures like trees that terminates. This is an important class of algorithms.

- Reverse engineering - The authors use techniques like attention map visualization, perturbation analysis, and algorithm reconstruction to reverse engineer the mechanisms transformers learn to try to solve structural recursion problems. 

- Shortcuts - The paper finds that transformers learn certain "shortcuts" or algorithms that do not fully solve structural recursion problems correctly, but that work for simpler cases. The authors are interested in understanding why these shortcuts fall short.

- Failure prediction - By reconstructing the shortcut algorithms transformers learn, the authors are able to correctly predict a majority of failure cases on one task. This helps explain model limitations.

- Abstract state machines - The authors use the formal framework of abstract state machines to model and analyze the algorithms learned by transformers.

- Tree traversals - In addition to a binary successor task, the authors also train and evaluate models on approximating more complex tree traversal algorithms.

Some other potentially relevant terms are attention mechanisms, model interpretation, sequence-to-sequence learning, algorithm analysis, and program synthesis. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using abstract state machines (ASMs) as a computation model for analyzing the algorithms implemented by the transformer models. What are some key benefits of using ASMs over other computation models like Turing machines? What limitations might ASMs have for this analysis?

2. The paper reconstructs the algorithms learned by the transformers for the binary successor and tree traversal tasks. What further experiments could be done to validate and refine these reconstructed algorithms? For example, systematically perturbing different components or training auxiliary classifiers.  

3. For the binary successor task, the paper shows the model exhibits "recursion heads" in the attention maps. What might be some neural or architectural mechanisms that allow these heads to emerge and specialize? How might we test hypotheses about these underlying mechanisms?

4. The paper finds differences in algorithms and generalization for different learning rates. What might explain why smaller learning rates result in weaker notions of the algorithm execution? Could differences be related to representation learning or memorization?

5. How might the findings generalize to much larger transformer models? Would we expect similar phenomena like "recursion heads" to emerge when pretrained on large datasets of code? How could we test this?

6. The paper emphasizes understanding cases where models fail on the tasks they are trained to solve. What are some ways the analysis approach could be expanded to better characterize and predict additional failure cases? 

7. For the tree traversal task, what are some hypotheses that could explain why models fail to learn full traversals but can pick up some tricks? How might we test these hypotheses and better diagnose the underlying issues?

8. The paper decomposes the tree traversal task into subtasks to analyze. What are some other complex recursive tasks that could be approached this way? What types of subtasks would be informative to analyze?

9. What are some ways the findings could inform improvements to training techniques, neural architectures, prompting approaches etc. to better handle structural recursion? 

10. The analysis focuses on small toy transformers without pretraining. How could the approach scale to analyze large state-of-the-art models from language model zoos? What modifications might be needed?
