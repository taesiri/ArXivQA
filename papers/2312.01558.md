# [Hyperspectral Image Compression Using Sampling and Implicit Neural   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01558)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops a method for compressing hyperspectral images using implicit neural representations (INRs). The approach trains a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with sinusoidal activations to map pixel locations to pixel intensities across the spectral bands of a hyperspectral image. The MLP parameters serve as a compressed encoding that can regenerate the image by evaluating the MLP at the pixel locations. A sampling method is also introduced to reduce compression time by randomly selecting a subset of pixel locations during training. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate superior rate-distortion performance versus JPEG, JPEG2000 and PCA-DCT at low bitrates. The proposed technique also achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) compared to recent learning-based compression schemes. Key benefits of the INR approach include good performance at low bitrates and the slow encoding/fast decoding property desirable for one-time compression. Future work may explore meta-networks and specialized architectures to further enhance compression capabilities. Overall, the paper makes a compelling case that implicit neural representations offer a promising paradigm for hyperspectral image compression across storage, transmission and analysis tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper develops a method for hyperspectral image compression using implicit neural representations, where a multilayer perceptron network with sinusoidal activation functions is trained to map pixel locations to pixel intensities to serve as a compressed encoding of the image.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for hyperspectral image compression using implicit neural representations. Specifically:

- The paper proposes to use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with sinusoidal activation functions to learn a mapping from pixel locations to pixel spectral signatures. The learned MLP network acts as a compressed representation of the hyperspectral image.

- The paper evaluates the proposed compression method on four benchmark hyperspectral image datasets and shows it achieves better rate-distortion performance (higher PSNR at same bpppb) compared to JPEG, JPEG2000 and PCA-DCT at low bitrates.

- The paper also proposes a sampling technique during training of the MLP to reduce compression time. Experiments show the sampling method improves speed and performance compared to training on the full image.

- Comparisons to other learning-based compression methods like PCA+JPEG2000, 3D DCT etc. also show the proposed method achieves better PSNR and SSIM.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a novel implicit neural representation based framework for efficient hyperspectral image compression that outperforms standard and learning-based baseline techniques. The sampling method also allows improved training efficiency.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Hyperspectral images contain large amounts of data as they record spectral information across hundreds of frequency bands for each pixel. This leads to huge storage and transmission costs. There is a need for efficient compression techniques that can reduce the size of hyperspectral images while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using implicit neural representations (INRs) for compressing hyperspectral images. The key idea is to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to map pixel locations to pixel intensity values across spectral bands. Once trained, the MLP parameters serve as a compressed encoding that can be used to reconstruct the original image by sampling.

Methodology:
- An MLP with sinusoidal activations is overfitted to map spatial locations to per-pixel spectral signatures 
- MLP parameters after overfitting serve as compressed representation along with image dimensions and MLP architecture
- Decompression involves constructing sampling grid, initializing MLP with stored parameters and evaluating it to reconstruct image
- Hyperparameter search is used to find best MLP architecture for given compression rate constraint
- Sampling method with window size and sampling rate factors proposed to reduce compression time

Main Contributions:
- Novel application of INRs for hyperspectral image compression
- Achieves better PSNR than JPEG, JPEG2000 and PCA-DCT at low bitrates 
- Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art learned compression techniques
- Sampling method demonstrates improved compression speed and performance over baseline

Datasets:
Evaluated on four standard hyperspectral benchmarks - Indian Pines, Jasper Ridge, Pavia University and Cuprite

In summary, the paper presents a new INR-based hyperspectral compression technique that is highly effective at low bitrates and also scales well with a sampling-based training method. The promising results demonstrate INRs as a valuable representation for learned image compression.
