# [Hyperspectral Image Compression Using Sampling and Implicit Neural   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01558)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops a method for compressing hyperspectral images using implicit neural representations (INRs). The approach trains a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with sinusoidal activations to map pixel locations to pixel intensities across the spectral bands of a hyperspectral image. The MLP parameters serve as a compressed encoding that can regenerate the image by evaluating the MLP at the pixel locations. A sampling method is also introduced to reduce compression time by randomly selecting a subset of pixel locations during training. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate superior rate-distortion performance versus JPEG, JPEG2000 and PCA-DCT at low bitrates. The proposed technique also achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) compared to recent learning-based compression schemes. Key benefits of the INR approach include good performance at low bitrates and the slow encoding/fast decoding property desirable for one-time compression. Future work may explore meta-networks and specialized architectures to further enhance compression capabilities. Overall, the paper makes a compelling case that implicit neural representations offer a promising paradigm for hyperspectral image compression across storage, transmission and analysis tasks.
