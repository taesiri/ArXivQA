# [Wikibench: Community-Driven Data Curation for AI Evaluation on Wikipedia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14147)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
AI tools are increasingly being deployed in community contexts, but the datasets used to evaluate them are typically created by developers and annotators outside of the community. This can lead to mismatches between an AI tool's performance on benchmark datasets versus how it performs from the community's perspective. The paper argues for the need for more community-driven approaches to curating AI evaluation datasets. However, supporting community members in navigating disagreements and steering the overall curation process poses open research challenges.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces Wikibench, a system that enables Wikipedia community members to collaboratively curate datasets for evaluating AI tools deployed on Wikipedia. Wikibench allows community members to select and label Wikipedia edits, discuss disagreements, and reach consensus on labels. It captures both individual labels reflecting personal perspectives and primary labels intended to represent consensus. The system provides transparency into the curation process and dataset contents.   

Key Contributions:
- Introduces Wikibench, the first system aimed at supporting intentional, community-driven curation of AI datasets in practice
- Reports on a field study with Wikipedia editors using Wikibench, demonstrating the system's ability to capture community consensus, disagreement, and uncertainty
- Shows evidence of the utility of the resulting dataset in evaluating different AI models' alignment with community perspectives 
- Discusses participants' use of Wikibench to shape data curation processes and build community
- Proposes future directions for community-driven data curation tools within and beyond Wikipedia

Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of community-driven approaches for curating AI evaluation datasets reflective of community norms and values. The introduced Wikibench system and findings from its real-world deployment significantly advance this emerging area of research.
