# [MatterGen: a generative model for inorganic materials design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03687)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents MatterGen, a new generative model for designing stable, novel inorganic materials across the periodic table. MatterGen introduces a tailored diffusion process that gradually corrupts and then refines atom types, coordinates, and the crystal lattice to produce high-quality crystal structures. Compared to prior generative models, MatterGen more than doubles the percentage of generated stable, unique, and novel (SUN) materials. It also generates structures that are over 15 times closer to their DFT-relaxed ground truth structures. Through adapter modules, MatterGen can further be fine-tuned on labeled data to steer the generation towards target chemical systems, symmetries, and properties. Experiments demonstrate MatterGen’s superior performance in exploring chemical systems compared to widely used methods like substitution and random structure search. MatterGen also directly generates SUN materials satisfying desired mechanical, electronic, and magnetic properties even from sparsely labeled data. Finally, MatterGen showcases multi-property optimization by proposing low supply chain risk magnets. The breadth and quality of MatterGen’s generated structures represents a major advance towards a universal generative model for materials design.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents MatterGen, a generative model for designing stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table. The main contributions are:

1) MatterGen introduces a new diffusion-based generative process tailored for crystalline materials, which gradually refines atom types, coordinates, and the lattice. This allows it to generate higher quality and more stable materials compared to prior generative models.

2) MatterGen can be fine-tuned via adapter modules to steer the generation towards materials with desired properties. It is shown to successfully generate materials with target constraints on chemistry, symmetry, as well as magnetic, electronic and mechanical properties.

3) Compared to prior generative models, MatterGen generates materials that are more likely to be stable, unique and novel. It also generates structures much closer to their ground truth local energy minimum based on DFT calculations.

4) MatterGen demonstrates the capability for multi-property materials design by proposing promising magnet materials that have both high magnetic density and low supply chain risk based on their chemical composition.

In summary, the main contribution is a generative model that can reliably generate high quality, stable inorganic materials across the periodic table, and can further be adapted to satisfy a diverse and broad range of property constraints for materials design.
