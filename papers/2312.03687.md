# [MatterGen: a generative model for inorganic materials design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03687)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents MatterGen, a new generative model for designing stable, novel inorganic materials across the periodic table. MatterGen introduces a tailored diffusion process that gradually corrupts and then refines atom types, coordinates, and the crystal lattice to produce high-quality crystal structures. Compared to prior generative models, MatterGen more than doubles the percentage of generated stable, unique, and novel (SUN) materials. It also generates structures that are over 15 times closer to their DFT-relaxed ground truth structures. Through adapter modules, MatterGen can further be fine-tuned on labeled data to steer the generation towards target chemical systems, symmetries, and properties. Experiments demonstrate MatterGen’s superior performance in exploring chemical systems compared to widely used methods like substitution and random structure search. MatterGen also directly generates SUN materials satisfying desired mechanical, electronic, and magnetic properties even from sparsely labeled data. Finally, MatterGen showcases multi-property optimization by proposing low supply chain risk magnets. The breadth and quality of MatterGen’s generated structures represents a major advance towards a universal generative model for materials design.
