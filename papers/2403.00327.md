# [Task Indicating Transformer for Task-conditional Dense Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-task learning for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation is important but challenging. 
- Existing task-conditional methods have limitations in learning shared and task-specific representations due to CNN architectures having limited receptive fields.
- Lack of multi-scale feature interaction in the decoding stage also limits performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Task Indicating Transformer (TIT), a lightweight task-conditional framework that uses transformers to capture long-range dependencies.
- Introduce Mix Task Adapter module that incorporates a Task Indicating Matrix to enhance modeling of inter- and intra-task features. Achieves parameter efficiency via matrix decomposition.
- Propose Task Gate Decoder module to enable adaptive multi-scale feature refinement guided by task embeddings and gating mechanism.

Main Contributions:
- Mix Task Adapter module for efficient feature adaptation and joint learning of task-specific and shared representations.
- Task Gate Decoder module for improved multi-scale feature interaction conditioned on task information.
- Experiments on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context show state-of-the-art performance compared to prior task-conditional approaches. Ablations validate contributions of proposed modules.

In summary, the paper tackles limitations of prior work by proposing novel transformer-based task-conditional modules for enhanced modeling, adaptation and decoding for multi-task dense predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Task Indicating Transformer architecture for multi-task dense prediction that uses a Mix Task Adapter module to enable parameter-efficient adaptation and cross-task modeling and a Task Gate Decoder module for task-guided multi-scale feature refinement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing Task Indicating Transformer (TIT), a lightweight task-conditional framework that leverages transformers to capture long-range dependencies and employs the efficient Mix Task Adapter module for feature adaptation and joint learning of intra- and inter-task information via Task Indicating Matrix.

2. Introducing the Task Gate Decoder module, which enables multi-scale feature interaction and refinement conditioned by tasks. The module learns Task Indicating Vectors and controls the adaptive integration of task embeddings and the fused feature map using the gating mechanism.

3. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks, NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in task-conditional dense predictions.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Task Indicating Transformer architecture with two novel modules - Mix Task Adapter and Task Gate Decoder - for improved multi-task dense prediction in a parameter-efficient and task-conditional manner. The effectiveness is shown through experiments on standard benchmarks.
