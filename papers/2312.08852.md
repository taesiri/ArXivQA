# [ERASE: Error-Resilient Representation Learning on Graphs for Label Noise   Tolerance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models achieve remarkable performance on graph-related tasks but rely heavily on large-scale high-quality labeled datasets, which are costly to obtain. 
- Economical label sources often contain noise, which compromises model generalization.  
- Existing methods do not explicitly model error resilience and struggle with high noise ratios.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose ERASE, an error-resilient representation learning approach on graphs to tolerate label noise.  
- The key idea is to maximize coding rate reduction between the full dataset and each class to learn representations that withstand unprocessed incorrect signals from mislabeled nodes.
- A two-stage decoupled label propagation method is introduced - structural denoising before training and semantic propagation during training to obtain reliable labels.  
- Prototype pseudo-labels are combined with denoised labels as semantic labels to update representations and parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Novel perspective of optimizing an error-resilient objective - maximizing coding rate reduction for learning label-noise-tolerant node representations.
- Decoupled label propagation to provide reliable structural and semantic labels for training.  
- Experiments show superior performance over baselines across noise levels and datasets. Gains are significant in high noise ratio scenarios.
- Approach enjoys great scalability as evidenced on large graph benchmark.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and empirical contributions towards learning error-resilient node representations on graphs under label noise, especially for high noise ratios. A decoupled label propagation strategy helps provide reliable labels to aid the noise-robust training process.
