# [Co-guiding Net: Achieving Mutual Guidances between Multiple Intent   Detection and Slot Filling via Heterogeneous Semantics-Label Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10375)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of joint modeling of multiple intent detection and slot filling in spoken language understanding (SLU). Previous works have two main limitations: (1) They only model the unidirectional guidance from intent predictions to slot filling, while ignoring the reverse guidance. (2) They use homogeneous graphs and vanilla graph attention networks (GATs) to model the interactions between semantics and labels, which causes ambiguity.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel model called "Co-guiding Net" based on a two-stage framework to achieve mutual guidances between the two tasks. In the first stage, initial labels are generated for both tasks. In the second stage, the initial labels are leveraged to guide each other's prediction in the next stage. To address the second limitation, the paper designs two heterogeneous semantics-label graphs (HSLGs) - slot-to-intent (S2I-SLG) and intent-to-slot (I2S-SLG) to represent relations between semantics and labels. It also proposes two heterogeneous graph attention networks (HGATs) over these graphs to model the mutual guidances effectively.

Main Contributions:
(1) Proposes a two-stage model to achieve mutual guidances between multiple intent detection and slot filling for the first time.
(2) Designs heterogeneous semantics-label graphs and heterogeneous graph attention networks to effectively model interactions between semantics and labels. 
(3) Experiments show the model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets MixATIS and MixSNIPS.

In summary, the paper addresses limitations of previous works by proposing novel components for mutual guidance modeling and heterogenous semantics-label modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
