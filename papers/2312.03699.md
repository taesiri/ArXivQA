# [PROMISE: A Framework for Model-Driven Stateful Prompt Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03699)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents PROMISE, a framework to facilitate the development of complex language-based interactions with information systems using language models (LMs). PROMISE allows representing interactions through state machine modeling concepts - states are associated with prompts to control LMs, and transitions between states can depend on trigger conditions, guards, and execute actions, also specified via prompts. This segmentation provides more control over LM behavior while leveraging their capabilities. States can be hierarchically nested, enabling multi-layered interactions where an outer state reacts to events unfolding over longer interaction windows. PROMISE streamlines the implementation of such complex conversational behaviors through code generation and by providing reusable, parameterized interaction building blocks. An application example demonstrates PROMISE's ability to orchestrate a simulated patient interaction and dynamically switch between coaching a physician and continuing the simulation based on detecting compassion. By bridging abstraction and implementation, PROMISE simplifies iterative experimentation to investigate the feasibility and value of advanced language-based interactions.
