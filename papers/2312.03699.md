# [PROMISE: A Framework for Model-Driven Stateful Prompt Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03699)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents PROMISE, a framework to facilitate the development of complex language-based interactions with information systems using language models (LMs). PROMISE allows representing interactions through state machine modeling concepts - states are associated with prompts to control LMs, and transitions between states can depend on trigger conditions, guards, and execute actions, also specified via prompts. This segmentation provides more control over LM behavior while leveraging their capabilities. States can be hierarchically nested, enabling multi-layered interactions where an outer state reacts to events unfolding over longer interaction windows. PROMISE streamlines the implementation of such complex conversational behaviors through code generation and by providing reusable, parameterized interaction building blocks. An application example demonstrates PROMISE's ability to orchestrate a simulated patient interaction and dynamically switch between coaching a physician and continuing the simulation based on detecting compassion. By bridging abstraction and implementation, PROMISE simplifies iterative experimentation to investigate the feasibility and value of advanced language-based interactions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 PROMISE is a framework that facilitates the development of complex language-based interactions with information systems using model-driven, dynamic prompt orchestration across hierarchically nested states and transitions to improve control of language model behavior.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the PROMISE framework, which facilitates the development of complex language-based interactions with information systems using language models. 

Specifically, PROMISE:

- Allows representing interactions as state machine models, with states and transitions that can be annotated with prompts to control language model behavior. This enables breaking down complex interactions into more manageable and predictable segments.

- Supports hierarchically nested state machines to model multi-layered conversations and nested interactions.

- Handles dynamic prompt orchestration across states and transitions to stitch together the full interaction behavior.

- Aims to improve the control over language model behavior and enable effective experimentation with complex conversational scenarios that go beyond simple question answering.

The paper validates PROMISE by demonstrating its ability to handle a simulated patient coaching interaction for physicians, involving multiple layers of conversation with a simulated patient and an automated coach.

So in summary, PROMISE contributes a modeling approach and framework implementation to facilitate developing and experimenting with complex language-based interactions powered by language models.
