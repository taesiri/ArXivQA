# [PROMISE: A Framework for Model-Driven Stateful Prompt Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
With the emergence of more powerful language models (LMs), there is potential for increasingly complex language-based interactions with information systems. However, controlling and directing the behavior of LMs remains challenging. Existing approaches like fine-tuning LMs or using prompting techniques have limitations in enabling reliable and efficient development of complex interactions. There is a need for more support in this area.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose PROMISE, a framework to facilitate the development of complex language-based interactions with LMs. PROMISE allows representing interactions using state machine concepts - states, transitions, triggers, guards, actions etc. Developers can attach prompts to states and transitions to control LM behavior. The key ideas are:

- Breaking down complex interactions into prompts attached to specific states and transitions. This improves control and predictability.
- Ability to hierarchically nest states and layer prompts. This allows multi-layered interactions with nested conversations.
- Providing reusable abstractions like predefined states for recurring needs.

Together these concepts enable flexible and efficient specification of diverse interaction requirements.

Contributions:
- State machine based interaction modeling approach that improves LM behavior control and enables complex, nested conversations
- Implementation of the framework in Python and Java with REST API and tools to facilitate application development 
- Demonstration of framework's capabilities through example applications in health information systems

The validation shows PROMISE's ability to handle interactions more complex than just answering questions or commands. The state modeling fosters discussions with domain experts to refine interactions. By bridging the gap between interaction requirements and LM capabilities, PROMISE advances the feasible use of LMs.
