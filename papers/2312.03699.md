# [PROMISE: A Framework for Model-Driven Stateful Prompt Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
With the emergence of more powerful language models (LMs), there is potential for increasingly complex language-based interactions with information systems. However, controlling and directing the behavior of LMs remains challenging. Existing approaches like fine-tuning LMs or using prompting techniques have limitations in enabling reliable and efficient development of complex interactions. There is a need for more support in this area.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose PROMISE, a framework to facilitate the development of complex language-based interactions with LMs. PROMISE allows representing interactions using state machine concepts - states, transitions, triggers, guards, actions etc. Developers can attach prompts to states and transitions to control LM behavior. The key ideas are:

- Breaking down complex interactions into prompts attached to specific states and transitions. This improves control and predictability.
- Ability to hierarchically nest states and layer prompts. This allows multi-layered interactions with nested conversations.
- Providing reusable abstractions like predefined states for recurring needs.

Together these concepts enable flexible and efficient specification of diverse interaction requirements.

Contributions:
- State machine based interaction modeling approach that improves LM behavior control and enables complex, nested conversations
- Implementation of the framework in Python and Java with REST API and tools to facilitate application development 
- Demonstration of framework's capabilities through example applications in health information systems

The validation shows PROMISE's ability to handle interactions more complex than just answering questions or commands. The state modeling fosters discussions with domain experts to refine interactions. By bridging the gap between interaction requirements and LM capabilities, PROMISE advances the feasible use of LMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 PROMISE is a framework that facilitates the development of complex language-based interactions with information systems through model-driven, dynamic prompt orchestration across hierarchically nested states and transitions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting PROMISE, a framework that facilitates the development of complex language-based interactions with information systems. Key aspects of PROMISE include:

- Using state machine modeling concepts to represent complex conversational interactions, with states specifying prompts and transitions containing triggers, guards, and actions that can also leverage prompts. This allows breaking down complex interactions into more manageable and predictable segments.

- Supporting hierarchically nested states and multi-layered interactions, where the flow unfolds based on decisions and actions taken within segmented interaction windows. This enables modeling of complex, nested conversational behaviors. 

- Overcoming challenges of unreliable prompt engineering and going beyond existing frameworks by enabling explicit interaction segmentation and mapping segments to flows.

- Providing means for rapid prototyping and experimentation with complex conversational interactions using language models.

In summary, PROMISE facilitates the design, implementation and testing of advanced language-based interactions by using state machine concepts to orchestrate prompts across hierarchically nested states and transitions. This improves control over language model behavior for complex conversations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the PROMISE framework for developing complex language-based interactions. What are some key capabilities of this framework compared to existing methods like prompt engineering or frameworks like LangChain?

2. The PROMISE framework utilizes state machine concepts to model interactions. What are some of the key modeling constructs like states, transitions, triggers, guards etc. and how do they help in controlling language model behavior? 

3. The paper shows both single state and multi-state interaction examples. What is the benefit of having multiple states connected through transitions compared to a single complex state? How does it enhance language model controllability?

4. The paper talks about special purpose states like ActivityGapInquiryState and SingleChoiceState. What functionality do these encapsulate and how does it reduce coding effort compared to implementing states from scratch?

5. Explain the concept of outer states in PROMISE and how they help in managing multi-layered conversations through nested states. What prompts do they inherit? How do they maintain context on returns after interventions?  

6. In the compassion coaching example, transitions from the outer state go to a feedback state and back to the simulation via a history node. Explain how this cyclic alignment enables complex nested conversations in PROMISE.

7. The PROMISE framework aims to balance language model capabilities with control through prompt orchestration. Analyze this tradeoff - what factors affect it and how can prompt engineering techniques augment modeling? 

8. The framework provides both Python and Java implementations. Compare their utility for rapid prototyping vs integration with web apps and databases. What REST API and persistency capabilities exist?

9. Assess the validation of PROMISE on the physician coaching example. What complexities demonstrate its capabilities beyond other methods? How realistic is this scenario and what other complex use cases is it suitable for?

10. The paper claims PROMISE conversations enhance requirement discussions with domain experts. Substantiate this collaborative advantage. What other software engineering benefits like reusability emerge from the state modeling approach?
