# [SSPNet: Scale and Spatial Priors Guided Generalizable and Interpretable   Pedestrian Attribute Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06049)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) method called SSPNet, which is guided by scale and spatial prior knowledge to improve model interpretability, generalization, and performance. SSPNet introduces an Adaptive Feature Scale Selection (AFSS) module to dynamically choose suitable feature map scales for different attribute groups based on granularity. It also proposes a Prior Location Extraction (PLE) module to incorporate spatial priors of attribute locations, avoiding irrelevant regions and overfitting. Three PLE strategies are explored: region-based, human keypoints-based, and sparse points-based. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets for recognition accuracy, cross-dataset generalization, and attribute localization. On PA100K, SSPNet achieves 83.58% mean accuracy. For cross-dataset tests between PA100K and RAP, it improves average accuracy by over 2%. Weakly supervised localization results also showcase accuracy improvements in IoU compared to baselines. Overall, the scale and spatial priors aid the model in learning discriminative features at proper positions, enhancing interpretability and performance.
