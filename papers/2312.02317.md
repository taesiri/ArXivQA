# [GNN2R: Weakly-Supervised Rationale-Providing Question Answering over   Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most current methods for multi-hop question answering over knowledge graphs only provide final conclusive answers without explanations. This issue severely limits the application of KG-based QA in real-world scenarios due to two main challenges: (1) annotations of reasoning chains are usually lacking, making it difficult to train models to generate explanations, and (2) generating explanations requires explicit reasoning over the KG which is inefficient at scale.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel two-step model called GNN2R that can provide both final answers and reasoning subgraphs efficiently as explanations, using only weak supervision through question-answer pairs.

In Step I, a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture is used to encode the question and KG entities into a joint embedding space where the question vector is close to its answer vectors. This allows pruning the search space of candidate answers and explanations.

In Step II, candidate reasoning subgraphs linking answers to topic entities are extracted and rewritten into natural language expressions. A pre-trained sentence transformer model compares these expressions to the question semantically and selects the most similar subgraph, returning its entities as final answers. Algorithms are proposed to fine-tune the sentence transformer using only the weak supervision.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of an efficient and effective two-step model (GNN2R) that provides both answers and reasoning subgraphs as explanations to questions, using only supervision of answers.

- A novel GNN architecture that can jointly encode questions and KG to identify candidate answers, pruning the search space.

- Simple yet effective algorithms to fine-tune a language model to select the best reasoning subgraph using only weak supervision.

- Extensive experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of GNN2R in multi-hop QA over benchmarks, including in terms of efficiency and quality of explanations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel graph neural network and language model-based question answering model called GNN2R that can efficiently provide both answers and reasoning subgraphs explaining the answers for knowledge graph-based question answering, using only question-answer supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel QA model called GNN2R that can generate both final answers and reasoning subgraphs efficiently with only weak supervision (i.e. question-answer pairs), while also achieving state-of-the-art performance. 

2) Proposing a novel graph neural network (GNN) that can efficiently reason over knowledge graphs to identify candidate answers and prune the search space for reasoning subgraphs.

3) Proposing a novel approach with simple and effective algorithms to fine-tune a language model using only weak supervision to extract reasoning subgraphs. 

4) Conducting extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and examine the quality of generated reasoning subgraphs, resulting in useful findings for future research.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the GNN2R model that provides explainable answers for knowledge graph QA efficiently and effectively with minimal supervision. The model has a GNN component for coarse reasoning and pruning, and a fine-tuned language model component for extracting explanatory subgraphs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step approach consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a language model (LM). Can you elaborate on why this combination of methods was chosen rather than using only a GNN or only an LM? What are the advantages of this two-step approach?

2. In the GNN-based coarse reasoning step, the paper introduces several novel components like the layerwise question encoder and the gated embedding update module. Can you explain the intuition and rationale behind designing these components? How do they improve the reasoning capability of the GNN?

3. The paper claims the GNN-based step helps prune the search space for candidate answers and reasoning subgraphs. Quantitatively, how much does the search space get reduced after the GNN step? What impact does this reduction have on the overall efficiency?

4. In the LM-based explicit reasoning step, the paper proposes three algorithms for subgraph extraction, rewriting, and fine-tuning. Can you walk through these algorithms and explain their key ideas and mechanisms? What modifications can be made to further improve them?  

5. The LM fine-tuning uses a triplet loss function based on relative similarities between questions and positive/negative expressions. What is the intuition behind using a triplet loss here? How does it help in learning useful fine-tuned representations?

6. The paper evaluates the method on multiple datasets and compares with several state-of-the-art baselines. What are some key strengths and weaknesses you observe from the results? How can the weaknesses be addressed in future work?

7. One key contribution is providing rationales behind answers. How does the paper evaluate the quality of explanations? What metrics are used and what are the main findings? How can explanation evaluation be improved?

8. Error analysis reveals different failure modes for different datasets. What inferences can you draw about the method's capabilities and limitations based on its failure modes? How can it be made more robust?

9. The method can answer questions in around 200 milliseconds on average. Do you think this efficiency is sufficient for real-time question answering? What are some ways efficiency can be further improved? 

10. The paper focuses on Freebase as the underlying knowledge graph. How do you think the performance would vary if applied to other knowledge graphs like Wikidata or DBpedia? What adaptations would be needed?
