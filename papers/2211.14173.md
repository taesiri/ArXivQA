# [NeuralUDF: Learning Unsigned Distance Fields for Multi-view   Reconstruction of Surfaces with Arbitrary Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14173)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to reconstruct high-quality 3D surfaces from 2D images for objects with both open and closed surfaces using neural implicit representations. The key hypotheses are:1. Using an unsigned distance function (UDF) instead of a signed distance function (SDF) as the surface representation will enable reconstructing shapes with arbitrary topologies, including both open and closed surfaces.2. A novel volume rendering scheme can be developed to incorporate UDF into neural radiance fields and enable robust optimization of neural UDF fields from images.Specifically, the paper proposes representing surfaces as the zero level set of a neural UDF field and introduces a new volume rendering approach to learn the neural UDF representation. This allows reconstructing objects with complex surface topologies like open surfaces, which prior works using SDF could not handle well. The main technical contributions involve designing a visibility indicator function and density function to effectively correlate UDF with volume rendering for robustly optimizing neural UDF fields from images.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using UDF within a novel volume rendering framework will enable reconstructing high-quality surfaces from images for shapes with arbitrary topologies, overcoming limitations of prior work that used SDF and could only reconstruct closed surfaces. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing a novel method called NeuralUDF for reconstructing 3D surfaces from 2D images via volume rendering. The key ideas are:- Representing surfaces using Unsigned Distance Fields (UDF) instead of Signed Distance Fields (SDF). This allows modeling both open and closed surfaces, unlike SDF which is limited to closed watertight shapes.- Developing a new volume rendering scheme to learn the neural UDF representation from images. They introduce an effective density function that correlates the properties of UDF with volume rendering to enable optimization of UDF fields. - Achieving high quality reconstruction of shapes with complex topologies (both open and closed surfaces) by optimizing neural UDF fields using the proposed volume rendering approach.In summary, the main contribution is using UDF with a tailored volume rendering scheme to extend neural implicit surface reconstruction to shapes with arbitrary topologies, beyond just closed watertight surfaces. The experiments show their method can reconstruct both open shapes (like clothing) and closed shapes accurately.
