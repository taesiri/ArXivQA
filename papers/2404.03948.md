# [Re-pseudonymization Strategies for Smart Meter Data Are Not Robust to   Deep Learning Profiling Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Smart meters are being widely deployed to collect fine-grained household energy consumption data. This data is useful for managing energy resources and fighting climate change, but also highly sensitive as it reveals details about individuals' private lives. To enable data sharing while preserving privacy, smart meter records are typically pseudonymized (personal identifiers removed) and frequently re-pseudonymized (identifiers changed over time). However, prior work has shown that pseudonymization alone is ineffective, while the privacy guarantees of re-pseudonymization against modern attacks were unclear. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes the first deep learning-based profiling attack to evaluate if individuals can still be identified from re-pseudonymized weekly smart meter data. The attack extracts features from weekly consumption records using neural network embeddings tailored to smart meter data. It then uses these learned features to match target users across different weeks by finding the nearest neighbor in the feature space. Six neural network architectures that can model sequential data are evaluated as the embedding model.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes the first deep learning profiling attack against re-pseudonymized smart meter data to link records across weeks 

- Achieves high attack accuracy, successfully identifying 54.5% of over 5000 households from electricity data across weeks, significantly outperforming prior attacks  

- Demonstrates attack applicability even with little auxiliary data, identifying unseen households 52.2% of the time using embeddings learned from other households

- Evaluates attack scalability on up to 67k households, showing accuracy decreases slowly with dataset size but attack remains effective, identifying 29.2% of households in the largest dataset

- Shows additional information (gas consumption) and less frequent re-pseudonymization further improve attack accuracy, identifying up to 73.4% of households

- Concludes frequent re-pseudonymization strategies are ineffective at preventing re-identification, questioning their privacy-utility trade-off
