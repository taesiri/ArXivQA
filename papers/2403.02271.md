# [RIFF: Learning to Rephrase Inputs for Few-shot Fine-tuning of Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02271)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT can be accurately fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks, but recently introduced models have hundreds of billions of parameters, making full end-to-end fine-tuning computationally demanding.
- Recent work has developed parameter-efficient tuning methods like prompt optimization and weight adaptation, but they don't consider altering the original input text.

Proposed Solution:
- Train a separate smaller model to generate paraphrases of the original input text to augment the data. 
- Explore objectives like maximum marginal likelihood (MML) vs policy gradient (PG) to fine-tune the paraphrase generator using feedback (rewards) from the main language model.
- Incorporate paraphrases during training and testing to enhance performance of various parameter-efficient LM tuning techniques.

Key Contributions:
- Propose an efficient method to rephrase inputs for few-shot fine-tuning of language models (RIFF).
- Conduct comprehensive study on objectives to fine-tune a paraphrase generator using rewards from the main LM. Find MML works better than PG.
- Show paraphrase augmentation during training and ensemble predictions with paraphrases at test time boosts performance of prompt optimization and efficient tuning techniques.
- Analyze impact across variety of classification datasets and on robustness to paraphrases.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage a separate paraphrase model to rephrase inputs to help improve few-shot tuning, using objectives that ensure semantic fidelity. The paraphrases augment the data and enhance generalization.
