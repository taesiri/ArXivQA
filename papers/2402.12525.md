# [LangXAI: Integrating Large Vision Models for Generating Textual   Explanations to Enhance Explainability in Visual Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12525)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing XAI methods for computer vision tasks often rely on visualizations like saliency maps which require substantial knowledge of AI and computer vision to interpret. This leaves an understanding gap for end users without that specialized expertise. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose LangXAI, a framework that integrates advanced Large Vision Models (LVMs) to generate textual explanations of the model's decisions for classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

- The framework has two main blocks:
   1) Extract saliency maps using XAI methods to highlight important regions in the input image that the model focuses on for its prediction.
   2) Feed the saliency map, input image, ground truth and model prediction to the LVM (GPT-4 Vision) which generates a textual explanation of the model's decision process based on a structured prompt designed for the specific task.

Main Contributions:
- LangXAI provides end-to-end textual explanations of visual AI model decisions using an advanced LVM, with the goal of increasing transparency and understandability for non-expert end users. 

- It covers three important computer vision tasks - image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation.

- Evaluations using metrics like BERTScore, ROUGE-L and BLEU show the LVM's explanations align well with expert interpretations, with high scores around 0.9 for BERTScore demonstrating robust semantic similarity.

In summary, LangXAI pioneers a human-centered XAI approach for computer vision via an intuitive text-based format, helping to demystify AI and enhance trustworthiness.
