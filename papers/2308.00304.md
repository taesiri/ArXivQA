# [Skills-in-Context Prompting: Unlocking Compositionality in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00304)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is: How can we develop effective prompting strategies to unlock compositional generalization capabilities in large language models?

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel prompting approach called "Skills-in-Context" (SKiC) prompting, which seeks to teach language models to leverage basic skills and compose them together to solve more complex problems. The key hypothesis is that by providing examples of both the basic skills and how to combine them within the same prompting context, this will enable synergies between the skills and composition capabilities, allowing models to generalize to unseen harder problems. 

The research then evaluates SKiC prompting on a diverse set of tasks requiring compositional reasoning, such as symbolic manipulation, arithmetic operations, question answering, dynamic programming, and math reasoning. The central hypothesis is that SKiC prompting will outperform previous prompting strategies like chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompting in enabling compositional generalization on these tasks. The empirical evaluations aim to test if SKiC prompting can truly unlock the latent potential of large language models to flexibly compose both provided and pre-existing skills to reliably solve complex reasoning problems.

In summary, the central research question is how to design effective prompting strategies like SKiC to elicit compositional generalization in large language models, and the key hypothesis is that presenting skills and their compositions jointly will synergistically enable models to generalize to harder unseen cases requiring innovative skill combinations. The experiments aim to validate if SKiC prompting can fulfill this promise.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel prompting strategy called "Skills-in-Context" (SKiC) prompting to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- The SKiC prompting strategy teaches LLMs how to explicitly compose basic skills to solve more complex problems. The prompt consists of (1) illustrations of the basic skills needed, (2) examples showing how to compose the skills, and (3) the problem to solve. 

- Experiments across a diverse set of compositional reasoning tasks show SKiC prompting achieves significantly better generalization performance compared to previous prompting strategies. It enables near-perfect generalization on some tasks.

- The results reveal strong synergies between presenting skills and skill compositions within the same context. This allows LLMs to effectively acquire both the skills and the ability to combine them flexibly.

- Intriguingly, SKiC prompting also unlocks latent skills and knowledge acquired by LLMs during pre-training/alignment. The LLM can utilize these to solve problems even when the required skills are not explicitly provided in the prompt.

- Compared to prior multi-stage prompting techniques, the one-stage nature of SKiC allows flexible skill application and avoids error propagation across stages.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating the effectiveness of the SKiC prompting strategy to unlock and improve the compositional generalization capabilities of LLMs by teaching explicit skill composition grounded in basic skills. The results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in compositional reasoning with LLMs.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of the paper and how it compares to other research in the field of compositional generalization in large language models:

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new prompting strategy called "Skills-in-Context" (SKiC) that aims to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compositional generalization refers to the ability of models to use known skills to solve new problems that are more complex than ones seen during training.

The key idea of SKiC prompting is to provide the model with:

1) Descriptions and examples of basic skills needed to solve a task 

2) A few examples showing how to compose those skills to solve more complex problems

3) The complex problem to be solved

By demonstrating the skills and their composition jointly within the prompt, SKiC is able to teach the model how to explicitly ground each reasoning step on basic skills. 

The paper shows through experiments on several tasks (e.g. symbolic manipulation, arithmetic, QA, dynamic programming) that SKiC prompting significantly improves the compositional generalization capabilities of LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA compared to previous prompting strategies like chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompting.

The main novelty is the idea of presenting skills and their composition together in the prompt context. This differs from prior work like least-to-most prompting that uses a separate decomposition stage. SKiC is also more general compared to decomposition-based methods.

The impressive results on a diverse set of tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of grounding reasoning chains on skills within the prompt. The analysis also reveals SKiC's ability to activate composition of both provided and latent skills from the model's pretraining.

Overall, this paper makes an important contribution of a simple yet powerful prompting technique to unlock systematic compositional generalization in LLMs. The analyses provide interesting insights into the synergies between presented skills, latent knowledge, and composition capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Providing the model with high-quality basic skills and more detailed illustrations to improve the execution quality of these skills. The error analysis showed that lack of mastery of basic skills was a major source of errors.

- Expanding the range of task-related basic skills included in the prompts to prevent errors caused by unseen skills. The error analysis revealed that absence of necessary skills was another major error type. 

- Providing more examples of how to compose basic skills, especially for more complex tasks. The error analysis showed incorrect composition was more prevalent for tasks requiring more complex reasoning.

- Utilizing better foundation models that can avoid copying errors in long context and that have a more extensive set of well-mastered skills in their pretrained knowledge. The error analysis identified copying errors as an issue in longer contexts.

- Exploring methods to automatically generate task-specific prompts rather than manually designing them. This could improve the applicability and scalability of the approach.

- Applying the SKiC prompting strategy to a broader range of tasks beyond the ones tested to further demonstrate its generalizability.

- Combining SKiC prompting with other orthogonal prompting techniques to further boost performance. The authors suggest it is compatible with methods like self-consistency prompting.

- Leveraging stronger future foundation models as they become available to provide a better starting point in terms of skills and knowledge.

In summary, expanding the skills, examples, and foundation models, generating prompts automatically, and applying SKiC more broadly are highlighted as key future directions to further improve compositional generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new prompting strategy called Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compositional generalization refers to the ability to combine basic skills to solve novel, more complex problems. The SKiC prompt contains three main components: 1) descriptions and examples of basic skills needed to solve a task, 2) a few examples showing how to explicitly compose the basic skills to solve more complex problems, and 3) the novel problem to be solved. The key insight is that presenting both the skills and examples of their composition within the same prompt context teaches the LLM how to ground each reasoning step on the known skills. Experiments on symbolic manipulation, arithmetic, question answering, dynamic programming, and math reasoning tasks show SKiC prompting achieves significantly better generalization performance compared to prior prompting strategies. Error analysis reveals directions for further improvements. The results demonstrate SKiC prompting can unlock strong synergies between skills and composition capabilities in LLMs, enabling them to leverage both skills presented in the prompt and ones acquired during pretraining to solve novel problems via compositional reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel prompting strategy called Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compositional generalization refers to the ability of models to use known skills to solve new, more complex problems. The SKiC prompt consists of two main parts: illustrations of basic skills needed to solve more advanced problems, and examples showing how to compose those skills to solve complex problems. For instance, the prompt could first demonstrate skills like extracting digits from a number and adding digits. It would then show how those skills can be combined to add multi-digit numbers. 

The authors evaluate SKiC prompting on several tasks requiring compositional reasoning, including symbolic manipulation, arithmetic, question answering, and math word problems. Across all tasks, SKiC prompting boosts the performance of LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA compared to standard prompting techniques. The gains are especially large on harder, out-of-distribution test cases. Analysis shows the approach teaches models to explicitly ground their reasoning steps on basic skills. Remarkably, SKiC also unlocks latent skills already within LLMs that are not explicitly provided in the prompt. The authors conclude that concurrently presenting skills and skill compositions creates strong synergies that unlock systematic generalization in LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new prompting strategy called Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to provide the LLM with examples that demonstrate both basic skills and how to compose those skills to solve more complex problems within the same prompting context. Specifically, the SKiC prompt contains three main blocks - a description of basic skills needed to solve a task, a few examples showing how to compose those skills to solve more complex problems, and the target problem to be solved. For instance, for a last letter concatenation task, the prompt would provide skills to extract words into a list and get the last letter of a word, examples showing how those skills can be composed to take the last letters of multiple words, and finally the target words whose last letters must be concatenated. By grounding each reasoning step in basic skills and providing explicit skill composition examples, SKiC prompting enables stronger compositional generalization on tasks like symbolic manipulation, arithmetic, question answering and math reasoning compared to previous prompting strategies.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of the key problem and question it is addressing:

The paper focuses on improving the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compositional generalization refers to the ability to use existing knowledge and skills to solve new problems that are more complex than those seen during training. This is an important capability for human-like intelligence and reasoning. 

However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with effective compositional generalization, i.e. flexibly combining known skills to solve more difficult, unseen problems. The paper aims to address this gap by developing an effective prompting strategy that can unlock the generic compositional generalization abilities in LLMs. 

Specifically, the key question the paper seeks to answer is: How can we design an effective prompting technique that teaches LLMs to leverage their existing knowledge and skills to construct solutions for novel, complex problems?

To summarize, the paper focuses on the problem of limited compositional generalization in LLMs, and proposes a new prompting approach to unlock this key capability by teaching models to explicitly ground their reasoning in known skills and compose solutions in a more flexible way.
