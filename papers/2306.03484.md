# [A Grasp Pose is All You Need: Learning Multi-fingered Grasping with Deep   Reinforcement Learning from Vision and Touch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03484)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable robots to learn multi-fingered grasping of objects using deep reinforcement learning, without requiring explicit modeling of the environment or hand. The key points are:- Multi-fingered grasping is challenging due to the high dimensionality of controlling many degrees of freedom. - Prior deep RL methods struggle to explore effectively and learn good policies from scratch.- Leveraging demonstrations helps, but collecting them is non-trivial. - This paper proposes an approach called G-PAYN that automatically collects demonstrations using a grasp planner, and uses them to warm-start RL training.- G-PAYN outperforms standard deep RL methods and baseline demonstration-augmented methods on multi-fingered grasping of YCB objects.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that automatically collecting demonstrations with a grasp planner and using them to initialize RL training can enable effective learning of multi-fingered grasping policies, without needing extensive manual demonstration collection or explicit modeling. The experiments validate this hypothesis.
