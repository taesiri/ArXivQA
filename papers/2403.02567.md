# [Eliciting Better Multilingual Structured Reasoning from LLMs through   Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02567)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current large language models (LLMs) have shown some progress on reasoning tasks, but prior work has focused only on English and simple reasoning problems. This provides a limited assessment of LLMs' actual reasoning capabilities.

- The authors introduce a new multilingual structured reasoning dataset called xSTREET that covers 6 languages (English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic) and 4 reasoning tasks (science, arithmetic, logic). 

- Experiments show LLMs struggle on non-English xSTREET problems compared to English, exposing a gap in reasoning abilities.

Proposed Solutions:
- Leverage the hypothesis that LLMs trained on code are better at reasoning. Apply techniques at both train time and inference time.

Train time:
- Create a dataset called TCC by machine translating comments in a source code dataset into 5 languages, keeping code intact.
- Further pre-train a multilingual LLM on TCC using parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Inference time:  
- Design a novel code prompt format called Sim that incorporates step-by-step function calls and multilingual comments to map better to the reasoning task structure.

Main Contributions:
- Release first comprehensive multilingual structured reasoning benchmark (xSTREET)
- Show training on multilingual code comments enhances reasoning in all languages 
- Propose Sim code prompts that improve multilingual reasoning performance by making model better adhere to reasoning format
- Achieve gains on xSTREET tasks using proposed techniques without losing performance on general NLU benchmarks

The solutions aim to elicit better underlying reasoning from LLMs in a multilingual setting by leveraging code as an intermediate representation. The paper demonstrates improved reasoning across languages is possible without requiring huge proprietary models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a multilingual structured reasoning dataset, xSTREET, analyzes limitations of current LLMs on non-English reasoning, and proposes methods to improve multilingual reasoning performance by leveraging code during training and inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing xSTREET, the first multilingual dataset for complex reasoning across 6 languages. xSTREET covers 4 reasoning tasks with expert annotations of intermediate reasoning steps.

2) Proposing two methods to improve multilingual reasoning abilities of language models:

(a) At training time, augmenting a code dataset by translating comments into multiple languages and using it for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. 

(b) At inference time, using a novel code prompt format called Sim that incorporates multilingual comments and structured function calls to guide reasoning.

3) Showing improved performance on xSTREET from both methods, with Sim prompts being particularly effective. The techniques help models better adhere to the prescribed reasoning formats.

4) Analysis showing that training on diverse code comments boosts downstream reasoning over monolingual comments or no comments. This provides evidence for the code & reasoning hypothesis holding multilingually.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a new multilingual reasoning benchmark, and techniques to elicit better complex reasoning from models by leveraging code structure and translations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes translating code comments into multiple languages and using them to fine-tune language models. What are some potential challenges or limitations of this approach? For example, how might mistranslations or differences in programming language conventions across languages impact performance?

2. The paper finds that training on multilingual code comments boosts reasoning performance even for English tasks. Why might this cross-lingual transfer occur and how could it be further improved or exploited? 

3. The Sim code prompt format bridges training and inference by incorporating code structure. What other prompting formats could be designed to better align representations between pretraining and downstream tasks?

4. The paper studies the impact of code for reasoning across multiple languages. What other training objectives or modalities besides code could help improve cross-lingual transfer of reasoning abilities?

5. The paper uses simple filtering criteria to select high quality code examples from a large dataset. What other selection criteria could be used and how might the quality of selected examples impact reasoning performance? 

6. The paper focuses on a 7B parameter model due to computational constraints. How might the method perform on larger scale models and what adjustments may be needed to effectively scale up?

7. What other multilingual datasets for structured reasoning could complement the xSTREET benchmark introduced in this paper? What additional languages or reasoning tasks should be covered?

8. The paper studies 4 reasoning tasks. On what other tasks would the benefits of training on multilingual code comments likely transfer best and why? What tasks would see little or no benefit?

9. How suitable are the linearized and Sim code prompt formats for real-world integration of reasoning systems compared to simpler formats? What usability challenges need to be addressed?

10. The paper focuses on improving reasoning performance. How well does the method proposed maintain performance on general NLU tasks and how could any declines in NLU capabilities be prevented?
