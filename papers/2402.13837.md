# [Design of a Miniature Underwater Vehicle and Data Collection System for   Indoor Experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13837)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to develop a miniature unmanned underwater vehicle (MiniUUV) and an indoor water tank facility for experiments related to vehicle path planning, control, bio-inspired locomotion, sensing and multi-vehicle coordination. Such a testbed allows conducting scaled experiments in a controlled laboratory setting without interference from environmental disturbances. The design and experimental validation of such platforms has been an active research area.

Solution:
The paper presents the design of a MiniUUV prototype using off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts. The vehicle uses a differential propeller drive system powered by two DC motors for locomotion. Buoyancy control is achieved using a peristaltic pump and syringe system along with an infrared sensor array to monitor the syringe plunger position. An onboard microcontroller handles sensor inputs and motor outputs. A 433MHz radio provides wireless communication. 

An indoor water tank equipped with overhead cameras was built. An AprilTag visual marker attached to the MiniUUV allows estimating its position and orientation on the water surface using video processing. Data is transformed between camera and world frames to obtain surge velocity, sway velocity, yaw angle and yaw rate estimates.  

Contributions:

- Development of a low-cost MiniUUV prototype capable of 3D motion using commonly available components and rapid prototyping.

- Construction of an indoor water tank test facility with an overhead camera system for position tracking.

- Experimental demonstration of MiniUUV's basic functionality through open-loop planar motion and buoyancy variation tests. 

- Processing scheme to estimate the MiniUUV's velocity and orientation from videos based on AprilTag detection.

The paper's descriptions of the MiniUUV and test facility design, the data processing methodology, and the initial experimental results demonstrate an accessible testbed for future marine vehicle research in sensing, control, and coordination.
