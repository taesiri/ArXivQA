# [Enhancing Numeric-SAM for Learning with Few Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper discusses limitations of the Numeric Safe Action Model (N-SAM) learning algorithm for learning action models with continuous numeric effects in planning domains. Specifically, N-SAM requires observing an action being applied in many diverse states before including it in the learned model, to ensure safety. This limits its applicability when few observations are available. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Enhanced N-SAM (N-SAM*), an algorithm that overcomes this limitation by including every observed action in the learned model, even if it was only observed once, without compromising safety. This is achieved by:

1. Projecting all observations of an action to the subspace spanned by them, using a modified Gram-Schmidt process. This allows learning preconditions and effects even with few samples.

2. Adding preconditions to ensure applicability only in states dependent on the subspace of observations.

3. Using linear regression to learn possibly non-unique but valid effects.

Main Contributions:

- The N-SAM* algorithm that can learn from fewer observations than N-SAM, by projecting states to a lower dimensional subspace.

- Proof that N-SAM* models are safe and plans made using them are guaranteed to be applicable in the real environment.

- Proof that N-SAM* is optimal - no other safe learning algorithm can deem an action applicable in some state if N-SAM* deems it inapplicable.

- Empirical evaluation showing N-SAM* learns effective models from fewer observations than N-SAM on several planning benchmarks.

In summary, the paper presents an enhanced algorithm for safely learning numeric action models that requires fewer observations, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation of its advantages.
