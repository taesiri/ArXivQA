# [Language models align with human judgments on key grammatical   constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Addressed:
- A recent paper by Dentella et al. (2023) concluded that large language models (LLMs) fail to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, showing a "yes-bias" in judging grammaticality. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors re-evaluate LLM performance using standard methods from linguistics for assessing grammatical knowledge, rather than reliance on metalinguistic judgments. 
- They construct minimal pairs differing in the key linguistic feature and compare model probabilities. Models that capture the generalization should assign higher probability to the grammatical variant.
- They also compare model judgments to patterns in human acceptability ratings.

Key Findings:
- Minimal pair analysis shows ceiling performance for most phenomena, indicating LLMs do capture the grammatical generalizations, except for center embedding. 
- Minimal pair surprisal differences correlate with human acceptability ratings, validating the models' knowledge.
- There is systematic variation in human judgments, challenging the binary coding as grammatical/ungrammatical.
- When evaluated using the exact human prompt, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 outperform humans in accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates that probing methodology significantly impacts conclusions about LLM generalization.
- Provides evidence that LLMs align well with human linguistic intuitions over a range of phenomena once appropriate evaluation practices from linguistics are used.
- Reveals variability and gradience in human grammaticality judgments, challenging a simple binary classification.
- Overall shows current LLMs have made significant progress in capturing key aspects of human grammatical competence.
