# [CASSPR: Cross Attention Single Scan Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12542)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to improve place recognition performance based on single LiDAR scans. Specifically, the authors aim to design a network architecture that can generate robust and discriminative global descriptors for single LiDAR scans to achieve accurate place recognition. The key hypothesis is that fusing point-based and voxel-based approaches using cross attention transformers can compensate for the limitations of each method and achieve better performance than either one alone. The point-based branch captures fine details while the voxel-based branch provides multi-scale spatial context. The cross attention allows combining the strengths of both.The main goal is to achieve state-of-the-art performance on place recognition from single LiDAR scans, as opposed to dense aggregated point clouds used in previous works. This is important for practical applications where single scans may be readily available but aggregated dense maps are costly to construct.In summary, the central research question is how to perform accurate place recognition from single LiDAR scans. The key hypothesis is fusing point-based and voxel-based approaches with cross attention. The goal is to surpass prior methods that rely on aggregated dense maps.
