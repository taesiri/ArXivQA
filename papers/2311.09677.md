# [R-Tuning: Teaching Large Language Models to Refuse Unknown Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09677)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate non-existent facts, referred to as "hallucinations", due to mismatches between their pre-trained knowledge and instruction tuning datasets. 
- Traditional instruction tuning methods force models to complete sentences even if the questions are outside their knowledge, leading them to guess instead of admitting ignorance.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a new approach called Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (R-Tuning) to teach LLMs to refuse answering unknown questions.  
- Formally identify the knowledge gap between an LLM's parametric knowledge from pre-training and the instruction tuning data.
- Construct a refusal-aware dataset based on the knowledge intersection - append "unsure" to uncertain questions and "sure" to certain questions in the training data.  
- Tune the LLM on this refusal-aware data to learn to refrain from answering questions beyond its knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Identify the knowledge gap between parametric knowledge of LLMs and instruction tuning data as the cause of hallucinations when forcing models to complete unknown answers.
- Propose R-Tuning method to construct refusal-aware datasets and teach models when to respond and when to refuse questions.
- Experiments show R-Tuning improves answering accuracy on known questions and refusing rate on unknown questions, for both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets.  
- Find that refusal ability is a transferable meta-skill improved via multi-task training. 
- Analysis reveals learning uncertainty during training is more effective than applying it only during testing.

In summary, the paper presents an effective approach to teach LLMs refusal skills in order to mitigate hallucinations and improve reliability when answering questions. The learned refusal ability also transfers across tasks as a meta-skill.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a refusal-aware instruction tuning method called R-Tuning that teaches large language models to recognize questions beyond their knowledge boundary and refrain from answering them, improving performance on known questions while reducing hallucinations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

- Investigating the knowledge gap between the instruction tuning data and the parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs), and attributing the hallucination issue to forcing models to complete answers with traditional instruction tuning.

- Proposing a novel instruction tuning approach called Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (R-Tuning) that distinguishes instruction tuning data based on the model's own knowledge. R-Tuning constructs a refusal-aware dataset to teach models to refrain from responding to questions beyond their parametric knowledge. 

- Demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization abilities of R-Tuning through experiments. The results show R-Tuning reduces hallucinations while performing well on questions aligned with the model's knowledge. The learned refusal ability is found to be a task-agnostic meta-skill that can be enhanced via multi-task training.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the R-Tuning method to teach LLMs to recognize when they should and shouldn't claim knowledge, thereby improving their ability to answer known questions and refuse unknown ones.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (R-Tuning): The proposed method to teach large language models to refuse to answer questions that are beyond their knowledge. Involves identifying uncertain questions and constructing refusal-aware datasets.

- Parametric knowledge: The knowledge acquired by language models during pre-training. R-Tuning aims to match the instruction tuning data distribution with the parametric knowledge. 

- Hallucination: The phenomenon of language models generating non-existent facts. R-Tuning helps mitigate this issue by refusing to answer questions beyond the model's knowledge.

- Uncertain questions: Questions that are beyond the language model's parametric knowledge. R-Tuning identifies these questions and constructs refusal-aware datasets accordingly. 

- Generalization: The ability of the refusal skill learned by R-Tuning to transfer to unseen datasets and tasks. Experiments show this is a meta-skill enhanced through multi-task training.

- Uncertainty learning: Learning the uncertainty of the training data as part of instruction tuning. Analysis shows incorporating uncertainty learning improves accuracy.

- Perplexity: Used to measure how well the language model predicts/understands the questions in the refusal-aware datasets. Uncertain questions have higher perplexity.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper attributes hallucination issue to forcing models to complete answers when encountering questions beyond their knowledge boundary. Could you elaborate more on why this is the case and how the traditional fine-tuning process contributes to the hallucination issue?

2. The key idea of the proposed method seems to lie in differentiating between the model's parametric knowledge and the instruction tuning data. Could you explain what exactly constitutes the model's "parametric knowledge" here and how it is identified? 

3. The paper proposes both supervised and unsupervised strategies for identifying uncertain questions in the refusal-aware data identification step. What are the relative merits and limitations of each strategy? When would you recommend using one over the other?

4. When constructing the refusal-aware dataset, the paper explores both "padding" and "replacement" strategies. What factors did you consider when deciding between these two strategies? What are the tradeoffs involved?

5. The experimental results show that learning uncertainty during training yields better performance than using uncertainty estimations directly from test data. This is counter-intuitive. What might explain this unexpected result? 

6. The paper frames refusal as a "meta-skill" that can be enhanced through multi-task training. What specific abilities allow refusal to function in a task-agnostic manner? Why does multi-task training improve this?

7. When analyzing the perplexity and entropy of the constructed datasets, what new insights did you gain into how the model handles certain vs uncertain questions differently? How does this relate back to the hallucination issue?

8. Beyond the methods explored in this paper, what other potential ways could you enable models to recognize question uncertainty and express when their knowledge is insufficient?

9. The paper focuses specifically on question-answering tasks. To what extent could the ideas proposed here be applied to other language generation tasks where hallucination is a concern? What adaptations might be needed?

10. What remain the biggest open challenges in developing reliable and transparent refusal behaviors in large language models? What important next steps build naturally from this work?
