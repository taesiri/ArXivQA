# [Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02665)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to increase the model capacity per language pair in multilingual neural machine translation, while keeping inference efficient. Specifically, the authors propose using Language-Specific Transformer Layers (LSLs) to allow some layers in the encoder to be source or target language-specific, while keeping other layers shared across languages. This increases model capacity without changing inference speed.The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:1) Using a mix of shared and language-specific layers improves over using only shared layers.2) Having both source and target language-specific layers is better than having only one or the other. 3) Automatically searching for the best layer configuration outperforms manual selection.4) Initializing the language-specific layers from a shared pre-trained model boosts performance.Through experiments on 10 languages, the authors validate these hypotheses, showing LSLs can improve performance while keeping inference efficient. The central research question is how to effectively increase model capacity per language in multilingual NMT without slowing down inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Language-Specific Transformer Layers (LSLs) for multilingual machine translation. The key ideas are:- Introducing LSLs, which are Transformer layers that have separate parameters for each language. At inference time, only the parameters for the input language pair are used, keeping computation constant. - Using a Neural Architecture Search inspired approach to determine the best placement of LSLs in the model architecture. This allows finding architectures tailored for the language set instead of manual trial-and-error.- Showing the importance of having both shared and language-specific components. The authors find shared layers are important for transfer learning, while LSLs increase model capacity.- Demonstrating improved translation quality by using source-indexed LSLs on the bottom and target-indexed LSLs on top of the encoder. This aligns with findings that bottom layers focus on source info while top ones capture target info.- Achieving gains of 1.3 ChrF (1.9 BLEU) points over strong baselines on 10 languages while keeping inference costs unchanged. Significance tests confirm consistent improvements.In summary, the paper introduces an effective method to increase model capacity in multilingual NMT while retaining the benefits of parameter sharing and without increasing inference costs. The NAS-based architecture search also provides a way to automate finding good mixtures of shared and LSL components.
