# [Effective and Efficient Conversation Retrieval for Dialogue State   Tracking with Implicit Text Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Few-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) relies on effective conversation retrieval to find similar examples for prompt-based learning with large language models (LLMs). 
- Raw dialogue context makes poor keys/queries. Fine-tuning a retriever requires additional labeled data, unscalable across domains.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce an LLM-based conversation summarizer to produce query/key text describing user intent. Enables maximum inner product search with pretrained dense retrievers.

- Distill a lightweight neural conversation encoder to embed dialogues into vector space close to their summary embeddings. Avoids costly summarization at test time.

Main Contributions:
- Show summary-based conversation retrieval significantly improves few-shot DST over raw context and labelled data fine-tuning baselines.

- Propose conversation encoder model CONVERSE trained with contrastive loss between dialogue and summary embeddings. Outperforms cascaded alternatives.  

- Demonstrate gains hold across GPT-Neo, LLaMA-7B/30B on MultiWOZ. Efficient for scaling to new domains/languages.

In summary, the paper presents more effective and efficient conversation retrieval for few-shot DST by using dialogue summaries as keys/queries. A distilled conversation encoder avoids costly summarization at test time while improving performance.
