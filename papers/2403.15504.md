# [SymboSLAM: Semantic Map Generation in a Multi-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15504)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Environment type classification is an important task but current methods rely on remote sensing, which provide a top-down view. These methods lack transparency and explainability. 
- There is a need for a transparent and explainable method that can classify environment types from the ground-level.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes SymboSLAM, a novel symbolic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approach that uses multi-agent systems and ontological reasoning to classify environment types.

- It uses a decentralized network of ground agents that extract visual features from the environment and build individual maps with semantic labels. A central control agent aggregates these maps and reasons about environment types using an ontology.

- The ontology encodes human knowledge about how different objects/features relate to environment types. This allows symbolic reasoning to infer environment types.

Main Contributions:
- A multi-agent SLAM system that transforms visual data into symbolic representation using semantic scene labeling. This enables the use of symbolic AI methods.

- An ontology that links environment types to observable features/objects. It allows inference of environment types through contextual reasoning.  

- A transparent classify-by-context approach that generates 2D topographic maps with landmarks and environment types. This increases interpretability.

- Evaluation on simulated and real-world environments in Canberra that demonstrates the ability to classify different urban environment types from ground agents.

In summary, the key innovation is using symbolic AI and knowledge representation on top of a multi-agent SLAM system to enable transparent and explainable classification of environment types from ground agents. The results showcase the promise of hybrid sub-symbolic and symbolic AI methods.
