# [Coordinated Navigation Control of Cross-Domain Unmanned Systems via   Guiding Vector Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving coordinated navigation control for a group of heterogeneous unmanned systems, consisting of both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Such cross-domain coordinated control is difficult due to the vehicles' heterogeneous dynamics, limited communication/computation capabilities, and practical constraints like disturbances. Most prior works have focused only on single-domain fleets or single UAV-USV coordination.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a distributed guiding vector field (DGVF) control framework that enables the UAVs and USVs to converge to and maneuver along prescribed paths, while coordinating as a formation. The key ideas are:

1) A hierarchical architecture with an upper-level heterogeneous guidance controller and lower-level tracking regulators that decouple the coordination problem.

2) Lightweight coordination based only on communicating virtual coordinates between neighbors, avoiding high communication/computation costs.

3) Rigorous technical analysis providing sufficient conditions for asymptotic convergence in the presence of vanishing tracking errors.

Main Contributions:

1) A DGVF controller for heterogeneous UAV-USV groups to achieve coordinated navigation along prescribed paths.

2) A lightweight virtual coordinate-based protocol that significantly reduces communication, sensor, and computation costs for complex coordination. 

3) Real-lake experiments using a customized cross-domain system with 3 UAVs, 3 USVs and WiFi communications, that validate the proposed approach.

In summary, this paper makes key contributions in enabling practical coordinated control for heterogeneous unmanned vehicle groups, with rigorous analysis and real-world validation. The lightweight coordination approach can unlock broader applications like surveillance, inspection, transportation, etc.
