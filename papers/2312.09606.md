# [Reliable Prediction Intervals with Regression Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09606)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks produce point predictions without any indication of their confidence. This limits their usefulness in real-world applications where knowing prediction reliability is critical for decision making.
- Alternative techniques like Bayesian methods or PAC theory have significant drawbacks in producing useful confidence measures.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes using Conformal Prediction (CP) to complement neural network regressors with reliable prediction intervals. 
- CP relies only on the general i.i.d. assumption like most ML techniques.
- The paper implements an efficient Inductive CP version that splits the training data into a proper training set to train the neural network, and a calibration set to calibrate the CP outputs.

Key Contributions:
- A computationally efficient way to produce reliable prediction intervals from neural network regressors.
- Introduction of a normalized nonconformity measure that tightens intervals by accounting for example difficulty.  
- Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows tight intervals matching required confidence levels.
- Application to predicting Total Electron Content, an important ionospheric parameter. Intervals cover only 14.8-23.5% of value range at 95-99% confidence.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an effective method to produce reliable confidence estimates from neural network regressors, with tight prediction intervals. This allows neural networks to be safely used in critical real-world applications. The application to ionospheric prediction also highlights the usefulness of the proposed solution.
