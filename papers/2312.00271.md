# [Towards Clinical Prediction with Transparency: An Explainable AI   Approach to Survival Modelling in Residential Aged Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00271)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper demonstrates the development of machine learning models to predict 6-month mortality risk for older adults admitted to residential aged care facilities. Using a large dataset of 11,944 residents from 40 facilities, the authors tested seven algorithms, finding ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forests (RF), and XGBoost (XGB) to have the best predictive performance. The models incorporated a diverse set of predictors related to demographics, health conditions, cognition, mobility, nutrition, and more. The top XGB model was further analyzed using explainable AI techniques to provide global and local insights into the model's functioning. Calibration of the GB model enabled reasonably accurate forecasts of patient-level survival probabilities at 6 months post-admission. At a 0.2 survival probability threshold, indicating high risk of death, the model had 74% negative predictive value. Key predictors increasing mortality risk included older age, male gender, impaired mobility, comorbidities, pressure ulcer risk, and poor appetite. The integration of advanced analytics with model interpretability is intended to enable individualized survival estimates to empower patient-centered goals of care conversations. Overall, the study makes a case for comprehensive, transparent prognostic modelling to enhance palliative care delivery and quality of death for the residential aged care population.
