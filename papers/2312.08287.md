# [On the verification of Embeddings using Hybrid Markov Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08287)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents a novel probabilistic framework for verifying properties of representations learned by deep neural networks (DNNs). The key idea is to specify verifiable properties using a first-order probabilistic language called Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs), which allows combining symbolic knowledge terms with sub-symbolic terms from DNN embeddings. The properties in the HMLN are parameterized with weights that are learned from specification embeddings observed from a DNN model. To verify a test DNN embedding, bounds on the probability distribution of properties conditioned on the test and specification embeddings are computed and compared. The probability bounds are estimated efficiently by formulating the inference as a Mixed Integer Linear Program. The verification approach is demonstrated on variety of DNN models including graph neural networks, deep knowledge tracing and intelligent tutoring systems. The results illustrate that the approach can effectively verify semantic properties of embeddings as well as their invariance, robustness and transferability. A key advantage of this probabilistic verification framework is the ability to specify rich relational properties between symbolic knowledge and sub-symbolic representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a framework for verifying properties of embeddings learned by deep neural networks by encoding them as formulas in a Hybrid Markov Logic Network and comparing probability bounds on those properties between a specification model and a model under verification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A novel probabilistic framework for verification of uncertain properties over symbolic and sub-symbolic terms.

2) Formalizing verification as a comparison between probability bounds on a property that can be computed leveraging existing state-of-the-art MILP solvers. 

3) Grounding the verification framework in real-world contexts including graph neural networks, knowledge tracing, and intelligent tutoring systems.

Specifically, the paper proposes representing verifiable properties as a Hybrid Markov Logic Network (HMLN) that combines symbolic knowledge with sub-symbolic representations from deep neural networks. It develops methods to learn the parameters of this HMLN from data and formulate verification as computing and comparing probability bounds conditioned on different models/datasets. The approach is demonstrated for verifying properties of graph neural network embeddings, student knowledge embeddings in deep knowledge tracing, and student ability embeddings transferred across tasks in an intelligent tutoring system.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Verification - The paper focuses on verifying properties of deep neural network representations/embeddings. This is done by encoding symbolic domain knowledge and sub-symbolic terms into verifiable properties using a probabilistic first-order logic language.

- Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - The verifiable properties combining symbolic and sub-symbolic atoms are parameterized as an HMLN probability distribution. The weights of properties in the HMLN are learned from specification embeddings.

- Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) - Verification is performed by formulating bounds on conditional probabilities of properties as a MILP problem, which can leverage efficient solvers.

- Specification Learning - A specification HMLN is learned from a specification deep neural network by optimizing a Rao-Blackwellized likelihood function to reduce variance.

- Weight Sharing - To scale up learning, weights are shared for an HMLN property over different subsets of groundings based on a hypercube refinement approach.

- Graph Neural Networks - Experiments verified semantic meaning encoded in node embeddings learned by various graph neural network architectures.

- Deep Knowledge Tracing - Verified invariance properties of student knowledge embeddings learned through deep knowledge tracing models on simulated student response data.

- Intelligent Tutoring Systems - Verified if embeddings can transfer from one task to another in an intelligent tutoring system using real-world student interaction data.
