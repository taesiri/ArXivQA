# [On the verification of Embeddings using Hybrid Markov Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08287)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents a novel probabilistic framework for verifying properties of representations learned by deep neural networks (DNNs). The key idea is to specify verifiable properties using a first-order probabilistic language called Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs), which allows combining symbolic knowledge terms with sub-symbolic terms from DNN embeddings. The properties in the HMLN are parameterized with weights that are learned from specification embeddings observed from a DNN model. To verify a test DNN embedding, bounds on the probability distribution of properties conditioned on the test and specification embeddings are computed and compared. The probability bounds are estimated efficiently by formulating the inference as a Mixed Integer Linear Program. The verification approach is demonstrated on variety of DNN models including graph neural networks, deep knowledge tracing and intelligent tutoring systems. The results illustrate that the approach can effectively verify semantic properties of embeddings as well as their invariance, robustness and transferability. A key advantage of this probabilistic verification framework is the ability to specify rich relational properties between symbolic knowledge and sub-symbolic representations.
