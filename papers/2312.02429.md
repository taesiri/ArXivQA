# [PEFA: Parameter-Free Adapters for Large-scale Embedding-based Retrieval   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02429)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a plug-and-play framework called PEFA that can enhance existing embedding-based retrieval models (\ERMs) for document retrieval tasks. PEFA incorporates nearest neighbors searched from an approximate nearest neighbor index to smooth the original rankings from the \ERM. Specifically, it linearly interpolates the score vectors from the \ERM and the nearest neighbors to produce improved rankings. Experiments on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that PEFA delivers significant gains over standalone \ERMs across various models like SBERT, DPR, MPNet, etc. For instance, on Natural Questions dataset, PEFA improves MPNet's Recall@10 from 80.82\% to 88.72\%, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies reveal the impact of the interpolation coefficient and number of neighbors on performance. A key advantage of PEFA is its model-agnostic nature - it can be readily applied to any existing \ERMs without architectural changes or retraining to boost their effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Post-Evaluation Feedback Aggregation framework (PEFA) to improve existing embedding-based retrieval models by interpolating their scores with nearest neighbor search.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a general framework called PEFA that can enhance existing embedding-based retrieval models (\ERMs). Specifically:

- PEFA is proposed as a general framework that can work with any black-box \ERM to improve its retrieval performance. The paper shows experiments applying PEFA to various state-of-the-art \ERMs like SBERT, DPR, etc. and obtaining significant gains over them.

- Two variants of PEFA are introduced - PEFAxs and PEFAxl. PEFAxs uses a linear interpolation between the \ERM and a kNN search, while PEFAxl uses a cross-attention between them.

- Experiments show that applying PEFA to existing \ERMs allows them to outperform prior state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models on document retrieval benchmarks like Natural Questions and TriviaQA. For example, MPNet+PEFAxl achieves the new SOTA results on Natural Questions, outperforming prior best model NCI.

- Ablation studies are provided to analyze the impact of key hyperparameters of PEFA like the interpolation coefficient λ and number of nearest neighbors k.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing PEFA as a general plug-and-play framework to enhance existing embedding retrieval models for document retrieval across multiple benchmarks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two variants of PEFA: PEFAxs and PEFAxl. What are the key differences between these two variants and what are the tradeoffs? 

2. The paper evaluates PEFA on two datasets: Natural Questions and TriviaQA. Why were these datasets chosen? What are some key characteristics of these datasets that make them suitable testbeds for evaluating PEFA?

3. The paper compares PEFA against several state-of-the-art methods including DSI, SEAL, and NCI. What are some strengths and weaknesses of these baseline methods compared to PEFA? 

4. The paper shows PEFA can provide significant gains over several embedding-based retrieval models like SBERT, DPR, and MPNet. What specifically does PEFA add on top of these baseline retrieval models to improve performance?  

5. The linear interpolation used in PEFAxs can be precomputed offline. What is the implication of this in terms of efficiency and latency at inference time?

6. For PEFAxl, the number of nearest neighbors k is a key hyperparameter. How does varying k affect performance and efficiency? What considerations should go into setting k?  

7. The paper evaluates PEFA when the baseline retrieval models are both fine-tuned and not fine-tuned on the target datasets. How does PEFA's performance gain differ in these two cases? What does this suggest about PEFA's ability to generalize?

8. Could PEFA be applied on top of other types of retrieval models besides embedding-based models, such as BM25 or query likelihood models? What would be required?

9. The ablation studies show that the interpolation coefficient λ for combining the baseline model and kNN signal is important. How should λ be set in practice when applying PEFA to new datasets?

10. The paper focuses on document retrieval. Could PEFA also be applied to other tasks like open-domain question answering? What modifications would be needed?
