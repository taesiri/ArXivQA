# [GaussianHead: Impressive 3D Gaussian-based Head Avatars with Dynamic   Hybrid Neural Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01632)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GaussianHead, a novel method for generating realistic 3D head avatars from monocular videos. The key innovation is the use of deformable 3D Gaussian primitives to represent the dynamic geometry and appearance of the head. A deformation network transforms randomly initialized Gaussians to a canonical space based on expression parameters. To capture intricate facial details beyond the capacity of a single network, canonical Gaussian factors are stored and queried from a dynamic explicit tri-plane structure. A learnable mapping is introduced to align the Gaussian coordinates and tri-plane factors, overcoming limitations of prior fixed axis-aligned mappings. The canonical factors are decoded by small MLPs into Gaussian opacity and view-dependent color represented as spherical harmonics. Differentiable Gaussian splatting renders the final high-fidelity results. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality on tasks like self-reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and cross-identity reenactment. An improved GaussianHead+ uses a compact hash map for storage. The method strikes an optimal balance between quality and efficiency.
