# [Two-shot Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12078)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It investigates the feasibility of training a video object segmentation (VOS) model using only two annotated frames per video during training. This is referred to as "two-shot VOS". - The authors propose a simple yet effective training paradigm to exploit the unlabeled frames in a semi-supervised manner. The core idea is to generate pseudo labels for the unlabeled frames and optimize the model using both the labeled frames and pseudo-labeled frames.- They introduce a two-stage training strategy: In stage 1, they train a VOS model using a labeled frame and an unlabeled/pseudo-labeled frame as input. In stage 2, they generate pseudo labels for all unlabeled frames using the model from stage 1, and retrain the model without restrictions on the inputs.- They show that with just 2 labeled frames per video (7.3% and 2.9% of the total frames for YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets), their approach achieves comparable results to models trained on the full labeled sets.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a VOS model can be trained using very sparse frame-level annotations (as few as 2 per video), by exploiting unlabeled frames through pseudo-labeling. The results validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the feasibility of two-shot VOS.
