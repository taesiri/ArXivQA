# [Pixel-Superpixel Contrastive Learning and Pseudo-Label Correction for   Hyperspectral Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering is an important unsupervised learning task. However, traditional clustering algorithms fail to capture discriminative features from high-dimensional HSI data. Deep learning methods have shown promise but pixel-level methods are computationally expensive while superpixel methods lack spatial details. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a pixel-superpixel contrastive learning framework with pseudo-label correction (PSCPC) that aims to get the best of both worlds. 
- Superpixel contrastive learning captures high-level features efficiently using superpixel segmentation. A few pixels in each superpixel are selected for pixel contrastive learning to align features.  
- A pseudo-label correction module is introduced that minimizes inconsistency between superpixel-level clustering labels and aggregated pixel-level pseudo-labels within each superpixel.

Main Contributions:
- Novel pixel-superpixel multi-level contrastive learning framework to extract robust and computationally efficient features.
- Pseudo-label correction module to refine superpixel clustering and align superpixel and pixel level results. 
- Extensive experiments on 3 HSI datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over previous deep clustering methods in accuracy and efficiency. 
- Ablation studies validate the improvements from both the multi-level contrastive learning and the pseudo-label correction module.

In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end deep learning framework for efficient HSI clustering that captures fine details through pixel comparisons within superpixels and aligns superpixel clustering with pixel pseudo-labels. Experiments show significant gains over previous methods.
