Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper presents optimization techniques for accelerating the inference speed of large diffusion models like Stable Diffusion on mobile GPU devices. The authors focus on reducing the latency of executing the computationally demanding components of Stable Diffusion, particularly the denoising neural network UNet which is invoked repeatedly during the iterative image generation process.
