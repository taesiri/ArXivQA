# [Speed Is All You Need: On-Device Acceleration of Large Diffusion Models   via GPU-Aware Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11267)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper aims to address is how to accelerate the inference speed of large diffusion models like Stable Diffusion for on-device deployment. Specifically, the paper focuses on optimizing the inference latency and memory footprint of Stable Diffusion when running on mobile devices with GPUs.The key hypothesis is that through a set of GPU-aware optimizations targeting the model architecture and kernels, the authors can achieve state-of-the-art inference performance for Stable Diffusion on mobile devices.Some of the main optimizations explored include:- Specialized kernels for group normalization and GELU activation- Enhancing attention module efficiency via partially fused softmax and FlashAttention- Strategic application of Winograd convolution The goal is to demonstrate that with these optimizations, the authors can attain much faster inference times compared to baseline implementations, broadening the applicability of large diffusion models on a wide range of mobile devices with limited compute. Overall, the core research question is how to maximize the on-device inference performance of large diffusion models through computational and memory optimizations tailored for mobile GPUs.
