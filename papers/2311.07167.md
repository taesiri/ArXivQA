# [STEER: Unified Style Transfer with Expert Reinforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07167)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces STEER (Unified Style Transfer with Expert Reinforcement), a novel framework for performing many-to-many style transfer without supervision. STEER has two main components: expert-guided data generation and a two-stage reinforcement learning approach. For data generation, candidate style transfer pairs are generated by decoding a paraphraser model with both a target style expert and anti-expert models in a product-of-experts fashion. High-quality pairs are then filtered and used as training data. For learning, STEER first performs offline RL on the generated dataset before switching to online, off-policy RL for further improvements. This allows STEER to learn from its own generations. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a diverse 11-style corpus compared to baselines like GPT-3, showcasing the effectiveness of STEER's unified approach. Ablations also reveal the benefits of using fine-grained, vectorized rewards during RL training. Overall, the success of STEER on arbitrary style transfer highlights the potential of combining expert-guided decoding with multi-stage reinforcement learning to overcome limited supervised data.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes STEER (Unified Style Transfer with Expert Reinforcement), a novel framework for arbitrary many-to-many text style transfer without parallel data supervision. STEER has two main stages: expert-guided data generation and reinforcement learning. First, it automatically generates pseudo-parallel style transfer pairs by decoding a paraphraser model with both a target style expert and anti-source style expert in a product-of-experts fashion. High quality pairs are filtered and used for offline reinforcement learning pretraining. Then, STEER switches to online, off-policy reinforcement learning with a vectorized reward signal to further optimize the model. Experiments on the CDS corpus of diverse styles demonstrate STEER outperforms strong baselines like GPT-3 and previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in arbitrary style transfer. The framework is also shown to be robust on out-of-domain text. Overall, STEER showcases the potential of reinforcement learning augmented with controllable decoding for text style transfer when parallel corpora are unavailable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes STEER, a unified style transfer framework that uses expert-guided decoding and two-stage reinforcement learning to overcome the lack of parallel data and enable transferring text from an arbitrary source style to multiple target styles.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop a unified framework for text style transfer that can handle transferring from an arbitrary, unknown style to multiple target styles, without relying on large amounts of supervised parallel data. 

The key hypothesis appears to be that by combining expert-guided decoding to automatically generate a diverse training corpus, with a two-stage reinforcement learning approach, it is possible to train a single model capable of high-quality arbitrary (many-to-many) style transfer.

The proposed method, STEER, aims to address the limitations of prior work that focuses on transfer between a single source/target style pair, relies heavily on large pretrained language models like GPT-3, or does not scale easily to multiple styles. The goal is to develop a more flexible, efficient approach to arbitrary unified style transfer using only a moderately-sized model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing STEER, a novel unified framework for text style transfer that can transfer text from an arbitrary, unknown style to multiple target styles. The key ideas are:

1) Expert-guided data generation: Automatically generating a diverse, high-quality dataset of style transfer pairs by decoding a paraphraser model with guidance from style expert LMs. This overcomes the lack of parallel data. 

2) Two-stage reinforcement learning: First pre-training the paraphraser model on the generated dataset via offline RL, then switching to online, off-policy RL for further improvements using multiple fine-grained reward signals.

3) Unified model: Enabling a single model to flexibly transfer arbitrary input text to multiple target styles, which is more practical compared to separate models for each style pair.

The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to competitive baselines on a challenging 11-style dataset. Remarkably, their 775M parameter model even surpasses the 175B parameter GPT-3 model on overall style transfer quality.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces STEER, a novel framework for unified style transfer that can transfer text from an arbitrary source style to multiple target styles. Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in style transfer:

- It focuses on the more challenging and realistic task of arbitrary (unknown source) to many (multiple target styles) transfer, compared to most prior work which only handles one-to-one transfer between known styles. 

- The proposed framework is end-to-end unsupervised, requiring only a non-parallel diverse text corpus and pretrained models. Many existing approaches rely on some parallel data or supervision for training.

- It incorporates expert-guided decoding to automatically generate pseudo-parallel data for pretraining. This overcomes the lack of human-curated parallel data.

- It applies offline then online reinforcement learning to further optimize a pretrained model for style transfer quality. This enables optimizing for fine-grained rewards. Prior style transfer work with RL has focused only on online learning.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a very challenging 11-style dataset, even surpassing much larger pretrained models like GPT-3. The model also shows strong robustness to out-of-domain source styles.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of style transfer by tackling arbitrary transfer and scaling to multiple target styles in an end-to-end unsupervised framework. The combination of guided decoding and two-stage reinforcement learning allows the method to surpass existing approaches despite the lack of supervised data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Investigating adaption to new target styles through continual learning. The current framework focuses on transferring to a fixed set of target styles seen during training. Extending it to adapt to entirely new target styles after deployment is an interesting avenue for future work.

- Scaling up the framework to even more diverse styles. The current work explores a corpus of 11 distinct styles, but applying the approach to an even larger and more varied set of styles would be valuable.

- Experimenting with different decoding methods and reward formulations during data generation and reinforcement learning. The authors propose their expert-guided decoding method and adapted Quark algorithm, but studying alternate ways to generate the pseudo-parallel data and define the rewards could lead to further improvements.

- Applying the framework to additional domains and tasks beyond style transfer. While focused on text style transfer, the overall approach of expert-guided data generation and offline then online RL could potentially benefit other domains with limited supervised data as well.

In summary, the key future directions center on scaling up the approach to more styles and domains, dynamically adapting to new styles, and exploring alternate algorithms for data generation and policy optimization.
