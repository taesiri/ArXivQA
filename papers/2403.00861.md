# [Pivoting Retail Supply Chain with Deep Generative Techniques: Taxonomy,   Survey and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00861)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of deep generative models (DGMs) and their applications in retail supply chain management. 

It first introduces DGMs, including explicit density models like autoregressive models and variational autoencoders, and implicit density models like generative adversarial networks and score-based models. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different types of DGMs.

Then, it reviews applications of DGMs in the three main phases of retail supply chain:

Purchase Phase:
- Demand forecasting - Transformers and other DGMs show promise for accurate demand forecasting. 
- Merchandising planning - DGMs can help with market research, trend analysis, supplier selection.
- Potential for inventory allocation and replenishment optimization.

Logistics Phase:
- Vehicle routing optimization - DGMs can model routing as a sequence generation task.
- Estimated time of arrival (ETA) prediction - DGMs can model sequential dependencies of sub-ETAs.
- Potential for discrete event simulation and network optimization.

Sell Phase:  
- Customer service - Large language models can automate conversational customer service.
- Search and recommendation - DGMs enable personalized and conversational recommendations.

The paper then discusses insights on strengths of DGMs for predictive and prescriptive tasks involving modeling joint distributions and stochastic optimization. It also highlights opportunities for large language models in customer-facing retail operations.

In conclusion, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of deep generative models and their existing and potential transformative applications across retail supply chain operations. It offers valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners on how to leverage DGMs in this domain.
