# [Improving the Generalization of Segmentation Foundation Model under   Distribution Shift via Weakly Supervised Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03502)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a weakly supervised adaptation method to improve the generalization capability of the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) to diverse downstream segmentation tasks. Motivated by SAM's awkward performance on out-of-distribution datasets with significant domain shifts, the authors develop a self-training strategy that leverages weak supervision from the target domain, including bounding boxes, point annotations, and coarse masks. To prevent performance degradation due to incorrect pseudo-labels, they regularize self-training with an anchor network that freezes SAM's pre-trained weights. They also apply contrastive loss between teacher and student feature maps for regularization. Extensive experiments on natural, medical, camouflaged, corrupted, and robotic images demonstrate clear improvements over competing domain adaptation methods. The adapted SAM generalizes significantly better to diverse datasets while retaining efficiency via selective weight updating. This presents a promising solution for adapting large pre-trained models like SAM without source data access or full re-training.
