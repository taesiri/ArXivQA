# [SDXS: Real-Time One-Step Latent Diffusion Models with Image Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16627)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in high-fidelity text-to-image generation. However, their multi-step sampling process leads to significant latency, hindering real-time deployment. Simultaneously reducing model size and number of sampling steps is critical for efficient inference.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a dual optimization approach - SDXS - involving model miniaturization and one-step generation.

1. Model Miniaturization:
- Image Decoder: Train a lightweight decoder to mimic a pretrained VAE decoder using distillation losses.  
- U-Net: Adopt block removal strategy to selectively eliminate modules from U-Net while retaining knowledge through distillation losses.
- ControlNet: Distill knowledge from original ControlNet into a compact version accompanying the tiny U-Net.

2. One-Step Training Strategy: 
- Feature Matching Warmup: Use feature matching loss to refine and straighten sampling trajectories, quickly finetuning model into one-step version.
- Segmented Diff-Instruct: Leverage score distillation in early timesteps and feature matching loss in later timesteps for stable one-step training.

3. ControlNet Training: Extend one-step training strategy to ControlNet to enable efficient image-conditioned generation.

Main Contributions:
- Propose model optimization methodology - SDXS - to simultaneously reduce model size and number of sampling steps for faster inference. 
- Introduce efficient distillation strategies for image decoder, U-Net architecture and ControlNet.
- Develop novel one-step training approach based on feature matching and segmented score distillation.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art tradeoff between efficiency and quality, enabling real-time generation on GPUs.
