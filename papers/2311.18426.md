# [Convergence Analysis of Fractional Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18426)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies convergence properties and rates of fractional gradient descent methods, which utilize fractional derivatives, for optimizing functions that are smooth and convex, smooth and strongly convex, or smooth and non-convex. Several novel inequalities are derived relating fractional and integer order derivatives, enabling assumptions like smoothness and convexity to be meaningfully applied to fractional methods. Using these results, the paper shows that with a proper variable learning rate, a fractional gradient descent method can achieve a $O(1/T)$ rate for smooth/convex functions and a linear rate for smooth/strongly convex functions, matching standard gradient descent. For smooth non-convex functions, the paper utilizes an extended notion of smoothness more natural for fractional derivatives and shows a fractional method can achieve $O(1/T)$ convergence to local minima. Experimentally, the paper finds that while the worst-case convergence rates match gradient descent, fractional methods can empirically converge much faster, likely due to learning rates far exceeding the conservative theoretical rates. Key challenges identified are extending analysis to non-standard smoothness assumptions and identifying additional assumptions beyond smoothness/convexity to determine when fractional methods outperform gradient descent.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes convergence properties of fractional gradient descent methods for optimization in smooth convex, smooth strongly convex, and smooth nonconvex settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Establishing novel inequalities that connect fractional derivatives to integer order derivatives. This allows properties like smoothness, convexity, and strong convexity that are expressed in terms of gradients (integer order derivatives) to have meaning from the perspective of fractional derivatives.

2. Using these inequalities to derive convergence results for fractional gradient descent methods in various settings:

- Smooth and convex functions: Showed a O(1/T) convergence rate similar to standard gradient descent 

- Smooth and strongly convex functions: Showed a linear convergence rate for a fractional gradient descent method similar to the AT-CFGD method from previous work

- Smooth and non-convex functions: Showed a O(1/T) convergence rate to local minima using an extended notion of smoothness more natural for fractional derivatives

3. Presented empirical results showing potential for fractional gradient descent to speed up convergence over standard gradient descent, but also highlighted challenges in predicting when fractional will be faster.

So in summary, the main contributions are establishing connections between fractional and integer derivatives, using those to prove convergence guarantees for fractional gradient methods, and providing some empirical evidence for the potential benefits of fractional gradient descent.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes novel inequalities relating the fractional derivative to the integer order derivative. What is the intuition behind these inequalities? How tight are the bounds derived?

2. For the smooth and convex optimization setting, the paper shows an O(1/T) convergence rate. However, this rate is no better than standard gradient descent. What modifications could be made to potentially improve upon the standard gradient descent rate?

3. In the smooth and strongly convex setting, the paper shows at best a linear convergence rate equal to that of gradient descent. What additional assumptions would be needed to prove a faster rate for fractional gradient descent? 

4. The paper introduces an extended notion of smoothness and strong convexity based on a parameter p. What is the intuition behind this generalization and what kinds of functions satisfy it? How does it relate to standard smoothness and strong convexity?

5. For the smooth and non-convex setting, fractional gradient descent seems more natural. Why might this be the case? What specifically makes choosing alpha = p a reasonable setting?

6. The experiments show a gap between the theoretical learning rates derived and optimal empirical learning rates. What might explain this gap? Is it possible to improve the theoretical rates?

7. The paper focuses primarily on single variable and separable multi-variable functions. How much more difficult is the analysis for general multi-variable functions? What new challenges arise?

8. How does the choice of terminal c_t affect convergence guarantees and rates? What guidelines should be used for setting c_t in practice?

9. Could the analysis be extended to other types of fractional derivatives such as the Riemann-Liouville derivative? What new difficulties might arise?

10. The paper suggests fractional derivatives could allow faster rates in some cases. What specific properties of fractional derivatives might enable faster convergence over integer order derivatives?
