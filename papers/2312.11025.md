# [Multi-Goal Optimal Route Planning Using the Cell Mapping Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of multi-objective optimal path planning for mobile robots. This involves identifying optimal routes from a start point to a target location while optimizing against multiple and often conflicting objectives such as shortest path distance, minimum traversal time, and lowest energy use. The majority of existing path planning methods focus on single objective optimization and do not effectively handle multi-objective scenarios common in real-world applications.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using the cell mapping technique to efficiently solve global multi-objective path planning problems in static environments. The continuous space is discretized into cells and a database is constructed to store non-dominated objective vectors representing optimal paths from each cell to the goal cell. The database is built iteratively using stratification mapping, incremental search, and dominance checking strategies to ensure only Pareto optimal paths are stored. This database provides a global perspective and contains information to extract optimal paths from any start cell to the goal.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the multi-objective path planning problem with two sample objectives - minimize path distance and terrain cost.
- Introduces cell mapping method to develop a global database with Pareto optimal paths from all cells to goal cell. 
- Outlines algorithm to construct comprehensive database using techniques like stratification mapping, incremental search, and dominance filtering.
- The database facilitates determining coverage area and number of Pareto optimal paths from any start cell. 
- Enables constructing detailed Pareto front for the multi-objective problem, a capability lacking in existing literature.
- Comparative analysis shows cell mapping achieves similar accuracy as MOA* algorithm while demonstrating superior computational efficiency.

In summary, the paper successfully demonstrates that the cell mapping approach can efficiently solve global multi-objective path planning problems and construct detailed Pareto fronts, outperforming existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a cell mapping technique to efficiently construct a database of Pareto optimal paths and objective vectors from all points in a domain to a specified goal for multi-objective path planning problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the introduction of an efficient approach using the cell mapping method for addressing multi-objective optimal path planning challenges. Specifically:

- The paper proposes using the cell mapping technique to develop a comprehensive global database containing optimal objective vectors (Pareto front) for routes from all domain cells to the target location. 

- It introduces a two-pronged search strategy - first using cell mapping to construct the database, and then analyzing the database to identify the extent and count of all Pareto optimal paths from any selected starting cell to the target.

- This allows efficient determination of Pareto optimal paths and construction of Pareto fronts for multi-objective path planning problems, providing an advantage over methods like the multi-objective A* algorithm. 

- The comparative analyses presented show that the cell mapping method can achieve similar accuracy to MOA* for single start locations, while demonstrating superior computational efficiency benefits when start and end points are in separate, non-overlapping areas.

In summary, the key contribution is the development of an effective cell mapping-based technique for global multi-objective optimal path planning and the demonstration of its efficiency compared to existing approaches.
