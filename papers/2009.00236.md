## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper "A Survey of Deep Active Learning":This paper provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of deep active learning, which combines deep learning and active learning. Deep learning has achieved great success in many fields due to its ability to automatically extract features from data. However, it requires large labeled datasets, which can be expensive to obtain in many domains. Active learning aims to reduce labeling costs by selecting the most useful samples to label from a pool of unlabeled data. Combining deep learning and active learning has the potential to leverage the strengths of both approaches. The authors first analyze the necessity and challenges of combining deep learning and active learning. They then provide an overview of deep active learning methods, categorizing them into query strategy optimization, expanding labeled data, developing common frameworks, and stopping criteria. The authors also review applications of deep active learning in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains. Finally, they discuss future research directions, including developing more robust evaluation methods, combining improvement strategies, and designing more task-independent models. Overall, this paper delivers a comprehensive analysis of the emerging deep active learning field.
