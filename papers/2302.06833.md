# [VQ3D: Learning a 3D-Aware Generative Model on ImageNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06833)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:Can we learn a 3D-aware generative model capable of generating high-quality 3D scenes from large and diverse 2D image datasets like ImageNet, without requiring multi-view images or ground truth 3D data?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) By using a two-stage vector quantized autoencoder approach rather than GANs, it is possible to train a 3D-aware generative model that scales well to large and diverse datasets like ImageNet. 2) Adding an implicit 3D representation like NeRF to the decoder allows enforcing geometric consistency and novel view synthesis as additional training objectives, even without multi-view training data.3) Pseudo-depth supervision further improves the 3D-awareness and quality of the generative model, even when trained only on monocular images.4) Avoiding the need to tune pose hyperparameters or distributions for each dataset is critical to make the approach generalizable to new datasets.In summary, the central research question is about developing a 3D-aware generative model that works on complex 2D image datasets, does not require expensive 3D training data, and avoids excessive tuning or dataset-specific adjustments. The key hypotheses focus on using a vector quantized autoencoder with an implicit 3D decoder to achieve these goals.
