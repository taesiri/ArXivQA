# [ICED: Zero-Shot Transfer in Reinforcement Learning via In-Context   Environment Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often lack the ability to successfully generalize to new environments, even when the environments share characteristics with ones seen during training. The paper investigates how the sampling of individual environment instances, or "levels", affects the zero-shot generalization ability of RL agents.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper first draws connections between adaptive level sampling strategies and the minimization of an upper bound on the generalization error, which depends on the mutual information (MI) between the policy and the training levels. Minimizing this MI induces an information bottleneck that prevents overfitting. The paper then introduces In-Context Environment Design (ICED), which combines adaptive sampling with a level generation process based on a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained to approximate the distribution of an initial set of level parameters, helping prevent distributional shift when generating new levels.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes a connection between adaptive level sampling strategies and mutual information minimization, providing a justification for why certain strategies like value loss prioritization improve generalization
- Introduces the ICED framework, which combines adaptive sampling and in-context level generation to minimize overfitting and distribution shift
- Empirically demonstrates that ICED achieves significantly better zero-shot generalization over existing methods in a Minigrid navigation task
- Highlights the importance of avoiding distribution shift that can result from uncontrolled generation of out-of-context training levels

Overall, the paper provides novel insights into how to design effective environment sampling strategies and introduces a principled technique (ICED) for improving generalization in RL through adaptive and in-context environment design.
