# [DrPlanner: Diagnosis and Repair of Motion Planners Using Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07470)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Motion planners for automated vehicles are crucial for safe operation, but improving their performance is challenging and labor-intensive, requiring expertise to diagnose issues based on testing in critical scenarios. No motion planner is perfect across all situations. Manually enhancing them is thus cumbersome.

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents DrPlanner, the first framework to automatically diagnose and repair motion planners using large language models (LLMs). It provides a structured description of the planner and planned trajectories using natural language and code. Leveraging LLMs' reasoning abilities, DrPlanner returns repaired planners with diagnostic details. The framework also advances iteratively using continuous feedback on the repaired outcomes.

Key Contributions:
1) A structured and modular description format for motion planners covering natural language and code to exploit LLM capabilities for diagnosis and repair.

2) Utilizing few-shot learning in LLMs by providing demonstrations when inferring diagnoses to enhance in-context learning.

3) Closed-loop iterative enhancement of diagnostic performance by feeding back evaluation of repaired planners into prompts.

The approach is validated on search-based motion planners. Results show the need for demonstrations in prompts and the framework's ability to effectively identify and rectify elusive issues. Overall, DrPlanner automates and enhances the intricate process of diagnosing and improving motion planners using LLMs.
