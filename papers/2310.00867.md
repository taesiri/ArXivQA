# [(Dynamic) Prompting might be all you need to repair Compressed LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00867)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses that this paper seems to address are:

1) Can prompting effectively recover the performance of compressed large language models (LLMs) beyond just simple cases? The paper notes that prior work has shown promise for prompting to recover performance after LLM compression, but has been limited primarily to perplexity evaluations on simple datasets. This paper aims to examine if prompting can scale and generalize to more complex downstream tasks.

2) Why can prompting recover performance after LLM compression? The paper lays out two main hypotheses:

- Null hypothesis (H0): Compression truly destroys model knowledge and prompting recovers it by re-learning that knowledge from scratch, similar to re-training. 

- Alternative hypothesis (H1): Compression does not permanently erase knowledge but rather just displaces it within the model. Prompting works by redirecting the model's inference path to tap into that existing displaced knowledge, rather than re-learning the knowledge.

The paper seems designed to provide evidence to evaluate these two hypotheses about why prompting is effective, rather than just showing that it works.

In summary, the key questions seem to be: (1) can prompting scale and generalize as a technique to recover compressed LLM performance, and (2) does it work by re-learning erased knowledge or redirecting to displaced knowledge already within the model? The paper aims to provide affirmative evidence for prompting's effectiveness on complex tasks, while also arguing in favor of the "redirection" hypothesis over the "re-learning" hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Identifying limitations of existing prompt tuning methods for compressed large language models (LLMs), specifically the over-reliance on using a single prompt per input. The paper shows this does not scale well to more complex tasks.

2. Proposing a new method called "inference-time dynamic prompting" (IDP) that allows selecting prompts dynamically for each input at inference time. This improves performance without requiring additional model parameters.

3. Providing analysis and experiments that suggest prompting is able to recover performance of compressed LLMs by redirecting internal knowledge rather than learning from scratch. This is in contrast to re-training methods.

4. Demonstrating strong performance of the proposed IDP method on a set of 9 diverse and challenging tasks using real-world metrics. IDP outperforms baselines including uncompressed models, compressed models, naive prompting, and other parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA.

5. Analyzing why prompting is effective for compressed LLMs through controlled experiments on attention patterns and prompt length. The results support the hypothesis that prompting redirects existing knowledge in the model rather than injecting new knowledge.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing and demonstrating a new prompting method called IDP that can efficiently recover performance of compressed LLMs by leveraging existing knowledge, without the need for expensive re-training. The effectiveness of IDP is shown across diverse tasks and using both quantitative metrics and analysis of model internal states.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper explores using prompt tuning to recover the performance of compressed large language models without expensive retraining. The key ideas are proposing inference-time dynamic prompting to select prompts tailored to inputs, and providing evidence that prompting works by redirecting the model's attention to recover displaced inherent knowledge rather than relearning from scratch.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my summary of how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on using prompt tuning to recover the performance of compressed large language models (LLMs). Other recent works have also explored using prompt tuning in this way, such as Xu et al. 2023. However, this paper identifies some limitations of prior work, namely reliance on perplexity and simple datasets for evaluation.

- The key innovations of this paper are: 1) proposing inference-time dynamic prompting (IDP) to create more diverse and input-specific prompts without added parameters, and 2) providing extensive experiments on complex downstream tasks to demonstrate that prompting can scale and generalize. 

- Compared to Xu et al. 2023, this paper shows that IDP outperforms naive prompt tuning on compressed LLMs for a diverse set of 9 tasks. IDP also matches or exceeds more costly re-training methods like LoRA.

- The paper also goes beyond just proposing a method, and analyzes why prompting works so well for recovering performance of compressed LLMs. The experiments provide evidence against prompting just re-learning knowledge, but rather redirecting existing knowledge.

- Overall, this paper demonstrates more conclusively that prompting not only works to recover compressed LLM performance, but also scales and generalizes beyond simplistic cases. The analysis also sheds new light on the underlying mechanics of how prompting interacts with inherent knowledge in LLMs. This advances the state-of-the-art in efficient tuning of compressed LLMs.

In summary, the paper pushes prompt tuning for compressed LLMs to a new level through innovative methods, extensive experiments, and insightful analysis. It convincingly establishes prompting as an effective, lightweight tool for recovering the performance of compressed LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different prompt selection strategies for inference-time dynamic prompting (IDP). The authors used a simple attention-based strategy to select the prompt dynamically, but suggest exploring other options like clustering prompts or using a learned prompt selection model. 

- Developing methods to automatically generate high-quality prompt sets for IDP, rather than relying on manual curation. This could make IDP more scalable.

- Further analysis into why prompting is effective at recovering performance of compressed models, beyond the initial analysis provided in the paper. The authors hypothesize prompting redirects rather than relearns knowledge, but more investigation is needed.

- Testing IDP on larger compressed models and datasets. The authors demonstrated IDP mainly on OPT-6.7B and LLaMA-7B - applying it to models like GPT-3 could better showcase scalability.

- Exploring the combination of IDP and other parameter-efficient tuning methods like adapters. The authors suggest IDP may provide complementary benefits.

- Developing theoretical understandings of prompting, like generalization bounds or prompt optimization formalisms. Most prompting work is empirical so developing theory could be impactful.

- Inventing methods to make IDP more parameter-efficient, such as through quantization or sparsification of the prompt parameters.

So in summary, the authors propose a range of future work around understanding, improving, and scaling IDP, as well as developing a more rigorous theoretical grounding for prompting techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates using prompting as a lightweight method to recover the performance of large language models after compression techniques like quantization and pruning. They find that existing prompting methods have limitations when applied to complex tasks and large datasets. To address this, they propose inference-time dynamic prompting (IDP) which allows the model to dynamically choose the most relevant prompt for each input from a set of prompts at inference time. This avoids having to use overly long or rigid prompts. Empirical results demonstrate IDP improves performance over baseline prompting by 1.24% on average across diverse tasks and datasets. The authors also investigate why prompting is effective for recovering performance after compression. Their experiments provide evidence that compression displaces rather than erases knowledge, and prompting is able to redirect the model's attention to recover this displaced knowledge rather than retraining the model, which would require more parameters. Overall, the results support prompting as an effective lightweight technique to recover compressed model performance across varied tasks and datasets.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores prompting as a lightweight technique to recover the performance of large language models (LLMs) after compression through quantization or sparsification. The authors first show that common compression techniques like GPTQ and SparseGPT lead to noticeable performance drops on downstream tasks, despite minimal impact on perplexity. They then investigate prompt tuning as an efficient way to adapt compressed models, but find that simple prompting fails to recover performance on complex tasks. To address this, the authors propose inference-time dynamic prompting (IDP), which allows the model to dynamically choose the most relevant prompt for each input from a curated set. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate IDP's effectiveness in recovering performance across diverse knowledge domains, outperforming other prompting methods and competitive with more costly adapter tuning. 

The second part of the paper provides evidence that prompting works by redirecting the model's attention to recover displaced knowledge, rather than re-learning that knowledge from scratch. Analyses of layerwise attention patterns suggest prompting causes minimal deviation from the original uncompressed model, while adapter tuning creates more significant changes. Additional experiments show IDP can recover performance even with very short prompts, indicating it redirects existing knowledge rather than introducing new information. Overall, the study makes a compelling case for prompting as an efficient way to recover lost performance of compressed LLMs by tapping into residual knowledge.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called inference-time dynamic prompting (IDP) to improve the performance of compressed large language models. 

The key idea is to use multiple prompts during inference and dynamically choose the most suitable prompt for each input instance, instead of relying on a single fixed prompt. This allows the model to incorporate relevant contextual cues for each specific input without manual intervention. 

Specifically, they use a set of curated prompts with no interactions between them. For each input, they measure the attention from the input tokens to each prompt and select the prompt with maximum overall attention. The selected prompt is then used to condition the model output while the other prompts are masked out. This prompt selection process requires no additional parameters beyond those for representing the prompts themselves.

By using IDP, the model can tap into its inherent knowledge more effectively compared to naive prompting with a single fixed prompt. Experiments show IDP substantially improves performance of compressed large language models on various downstream tasks compared to baseline approaches. The gains highlight IDP's ability to recover performance by redirecting the model's attention and accessing displaced knowledge.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of performance degradation in large language models (LLMs) after compression techniques like quantization and pruning are applied. Specifically:

- Many recent compression methods like GPTQ and SparseGPT claim to maintain accuracy while significantly reducing model size. However, the paper finds these compressed models actually have a noticeable drop in performance on realistic downstream tasks, even though perplexity scores remain similar. This reveals a gap between perplexity and real-world efficacy.

- The paper investigates using lightweight prompt tuning to recover the lost performance, as an alternative to expensive retraining. However, they find existing prompting methods still fail to fully restore performance on complex tasks, showing limitations in scaling and generalizing prompting beyond simple cases. 

- Overall, the key questions are: Can prompting techniques effectively recover performance of compressed LLMs on real downstream tasks? If so, can prompting scale and generalize beyond basic cases? And how does prompting compare to full retraining for knowledge recovery?

The paper aims to provide more definitive evidence that prompting can successfully repair compressed LLMs at scale, using a new prompting strategy called inference-time dynamic prompting (IDP). The paper also delves deeper into understanding why prompting is effective for recovering knowledge in compressed models compared to full retraining.
