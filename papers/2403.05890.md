# [Towards Efficient Replay in Federated Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies federated incremental learning (FIL) where edge clients continuously collect new data over time. In this setting, catastrophic forgetting becomes a major challenge - models fail to retain knowledge from previous tasks when learning new tasks. Existing methods to mitigate forgetting such as replay are difficult to apply in FIL due to data privacy concerns, heterogeneity across clients, and limited client storage. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Re-Fed, an efficient and modular framework to alleviate catastrophic forgetting in FIL via coordinated sample caching and replay. The key ideas are:

1) Cache samples based on importance scores that consider both local and global dataset statistics. This is done by introducing a personalized informative model (PIM) for each client that integrates knowledge from both local and global models.

2) Quantify sample importance based on gradient norms during PIM update. Samples that drive PIM towards fitting tasks on both local and global data are considered more important.

3) Cache samples with higher importance scores when new tasks arrive. Continue training on cached previous samples and new samples.

The framework retains efficiency and privacy of traditional FL. Its modular design allows integrating optimizations from prior arts.

Contributions:  
1) Identify and formulate the problem of catastrophic forgetting with data heterogeneity in FIL.

2) Propose Re-Fed, an efficient and modular solution to coordinate clients to cache/replay important samples alleviating forgetting.

3) Theoretically prove Re-Fed can discover globally and locally important samples for replay and guarantee convergence.  

4) Empirically demonstrate Re-Fed achieves substantially better performance over state-of-the-arts on various datasets and FIL scenarios, with up to 19.73% accuracy gains.
