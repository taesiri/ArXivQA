# [FBChain: A Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model with Efficiency and   Secure Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning allows training machine learning models on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, there are two key issues during federated learning's communication process: 1) "Parameter leakage" - local model parameters may be tampered with or leaked during transmission due to insecure communication methods, compromising privacy. 2) "Inefficient communication" - transmission speeds can be slow due to differences in capabilities between nodes, impacting efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FBChain, a blockchain-based federated learning framework to address the above issues. 

1) To prevent "parameter leakage", FBChain stores only a hash of local model parameters on the blockchain while encrypting the actual parameters during transmission. This verifies integrity without overloading the blockchain with parameter data. 

2) To improve "inefficient communication", FBChain introduces a Proof of Weighted Link Speed (PoWLS) consensus algorithm that selects nodes with higher bandwidth and lower latency as aggregators and block packagers. This ensures nodes with better connectivity handle communication.

Main Contributions:
- An architecture that reduces blockchain storage needs while enhancing privacy and security during federated learning communication by encrypting parameters and storing hashes.

- A PoWLS consensus algorithm that improves communication efficiency by dynamically selecting well-connected nodes for aggregation and packaging.

- Evaluations demonstrating higher efficiency and integrity compared to vanilla federated learning and prior art like VBFL.

In summary, FBChain tackles efficiency and security issues in federated learning through an integrated architecture based on encryption, hashing and a weighted consensus protocol. Experiments validate its ability to enable effective and robust decentralized model training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a federated learning framework called FBChain that uses blockchain to improve communication efficiency and security by storing global models and local model hashes on-chain while encrypting full local models, and selecting aggregation nodes based on network conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the FBChain model for federated learning that improves communication efficiency while preventing potential data tampers and leakage during model parameter transmission. It also reduces blockchain storage pressure by only storing hash values of local models rather than the full models.

2. It introduces the Proof of Weighted Link Speed (PoWLS) consensus algorithm that selects nodes with better network link speed and lower latency to be the aggregator and packaging nodes. This improves the efficiency of data transmission between local training nodes and aggregation nodes. 

3. It uses encryption mechanisms (asymmetric and symmetric) to secure the communication of local model parameters between nodes. It also uses hashing and stores the hashes on the blockchain to verify integrity of the parameters.

4. It introduces a credit score system to assess performance of nodes and limit participation of nodes with lower scores, avoiding poor quality models from contributing to the global model. This also improves communication efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is a federated learning framework that focuses on improving communication efficiency and security during the decentralized training process.
