# [H-GAP: Humanoid Control with a Generalist Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02682)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes H-GAP, a large transformer-based generative model for general-purpose humanoid control trained on the diverse MoCapAct dataset. H-GAP uses a VQ-VAE to discretize and autoencode state-action trajectories into latent codes and models the prior distribution over these codes with an autoregressive transformer conditioned on initial states. For downstream tasks, H-GAP can generate and evaluate candidate trajectories via planning algorithms like MPC, showing strong zero-shot performance without any online interactions. Experiments demonstrate that H-GAP faithfully represents diverse motor behaviors and outperforms specialist offline RL methods and model-predictive baselines on novel humanoid locomotion tasks. Ablations reveal that model scaling improves reconstruction but can reduce planning diversity and downstream adaptability. In contrast, larger training datasets consistently benefit both imitation accuracy and task performance. The work underscores the promise of foundation models for humanoid control given sufficient data, motivates dataset expansion for greater diversity, and provides insights to guide further research on scaling properties.
