# [KnowLA: Enhancing Parameter-efficient Finetuning with Knowledgeable   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have billions of parameters, making full finetuning computationally expensive. Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA are used to adapt LLMs to downstream tasks without changing most parameters. 

- Prior work injected knowledge graphs (KGs) into pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT. But these require full finetuning and their effectiveness for recent decoder-based LLMs is unknown. 

- Questions: Can knowledge injection enhance the PEFT of LLMs? How can it be used to improve PEFT methods like LoRA?

Proposed Solution:
- Propose KnowLA, a knowledgeable adaptation method that inserts an adaptation layer into an LLM to integrate KG entity embeddings for tokens in the input text.

- The adaptation layer aligns KG and LLM spaces and fuses entity embeddings with token representations using an attention mechanism.

- KnowLA is trained on instruction data in combination with LoRA, keeping LLM and entity embeddings frozen. This allows injecting knowledge while preserving efficiency.

Contributions:
- First attempt at injecting KG knowledge into LLMs for improving PEFT methods. More effective than retrieval methods.

- Experiments on 6 QA datasets with Llama and 3 KGs show KnowLA consistently improves LoRA, using only 0.5% extra parameters. Outperforms Alpaca baseline.

- Analysis shows KnowLA can align LLM and KG spaces and also activate relevant latent knowledge in the LLM itself. Allows answering without changing parameters or prompts.

- Showed robustness of KnowLA w.r.t. different LLMs, instruction data, PEFT methods, KG embedding models etc. Can bring stable improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes KnowLA, a knowledgeable adaptation method that inserts an adaptation layer into a large language model to integrate knowledge graph embeddings of entities in the input text during parameter-efficient finetuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing KnowLA, a knowledgeable adaptation method that inserts an adaptation layer into a large language model (LLM) to integrate external knowledge graph (KG) embeddings of entities appearing in the input text. KnowLA works in combination with parameter-efficient finetuning methods like LoRA to enhance the effectiveness of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate KnowLA's ability to improve performance with limited additional parameters. The paper also analyzes how KnowLA helps align the vector spaces of KGs and LLMs and activates relevant knowledge in LLMs.

The paper proposes a knowledgeable adaptation method called KnowLA to enhance the effectiveness of parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) of large language models (LLMs). It inserts an adaptation layer into an LLM to integrate knowledge graph (KG) embeddings of entities in the input text. Experiments using ConceptNet, WordNet, and Wikidata show KnowLA improves results on tasks like commonsense reasoning, social interaction reasoning, and QA while using only a small number of additional parameters. The key ideas involve aligning the KG and LLM spaces and activating relevant knowledge in the LLM.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does KnowLA align the vector space of knowledge graph embeddings with the hidden state space of the large language model? What techniques are used for this alignment?

2. The paper mentions that KnowLA can help "activate" relevant knowledge in the large language model. What analysis was done to demonstrate and understand this knowledge activation? 

3. How does KnowLA select the most relevant entities from the knowledge graph for each token in the input text? What relevance calculation is used?

4. What is the impact of using different knowledge graph embedding techniques like TransE, RotatE, etc. on the performance of KnowLA? Was an analysis done?

5. Was KnowLA evaluated with different types of knowledge graphs like factual KGs, lexical KGs, commonsense KGs etc.? If so, what insights were obtained about the utility of different KG types?  

6. How can the idea of KnowLA be extended to incorporate multiple knowledge graphs simultaneously instead of just one KG? What are the challenges in fusing multi-source KGs?

7. What is the additional computational overhead caused by KnowLA during training and inference? Is it practical for real-world deployments?

8. Can the idea of KnowLA be applied to other parameter-efficient tuning methods like adapter tuning, prompt tuning etc. instead of just LoRA?

9. Does KnowLA lead to any negative side effects like decreased performance on certain types of tasks or datasets? Was any analysis done?

10. Can KnowLA allow seamless integration of knowledge graph updates over time through techniques like lifelong learning? What would be needed to enable continual learning?
