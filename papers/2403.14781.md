# [Champ: Controllable and Consistent Human Image Animation with 3D   Parametric Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing techniques for human image animation rely on reference images paired with motion guidance like skeletons or dense poses. However, these have limitations in accurately capturing intricate human geometry and motions. 

- Methods based on GANs can struggle with effectively transferring motion between reference image and source video when there are substantial variations in identity and scene dynamics.

- Diffusion models are promising but need further improvements in shape alignment and motion guidance.

Solution:
- Proposes using the SMPL 3D parametric human model to establish correspondence between reference image and source video for enhanced alignment.

- SMPL provides a unified representation of body shape and pose variations to better capture nuanced geometry and motions.

- Renders depth maps, normal maps, semantic maps from SMPL video sequence as condition inputs to diffusion model.

- Also uses skeleton-based guidance (DWpose) to complement SMPL for better facial and hand details.

- Employs guidance self-attention and multi-layer motion fusion with UNet denoising for effective conditioning.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces SMPL-based shape alignment and motion guidance in latent diffusion models for higher quality and more accurate human image animation.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TikTok dataset and robust generalization on a novel wild dataset through experiments.

- Enhanced conditioning through multi-layer SMPL outputs and self-attention based feature integration for diffusion models.

- Demonstrates ability to animate diverse portraits with significant domain shifts like paintings, text-to-image outputs etc.
