## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assertion detection is critical in clinical NLP to understand medical concepts from unstructured clinical text. It involves identifying assertion types (certainty, temporality, experiencer) which provide context for conditions described.
- Traditional rule-based systems have limitations in coverage. ML/DL models require substantial labeled data and underperform on less common assertions.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on medical data to learn textual patterns. 
- Enhance LLM reasoning with advanced techniques - Tree of Thought (ToT), Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC) - to decompose problems and evaluate solution paths.
- Further optimize model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning for specialized assertion detection task.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on public i2b2 dataset and local UPMC sleep disorder clinical notes.
- Achieved micro F1 score of 0.89 on i2b2, 0.11 higher than previous works. F1 of 0.74 on Sleep dataset, 0.31 higher than baseline.

Main Contributions:
- Developed and evaluated LLMs enhanced by ToT, CoT, SC for improved reasoning and interpretability.
- Introduced LoRA fine-tuning for greater precision and contextual understanding. 
- Demonstrated effectiveness and generalizability of approach on both public and local private clinical datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes using pre-trained LLMs with advanced reasoning techniques and efficient fine-tuning as a viable methodology for clinical assertion detection. The experiments highlight the potential of this approach to integrate with other LLM-based clinical NLP tasks.
