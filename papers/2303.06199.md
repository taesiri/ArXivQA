# [Turning Strengths into Weaknesses: A Certified Robustness Inspired   Attack Framework against Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06199)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can we design a general attack framework that can further enhance both existing graph evasion and poisoning attacks against graph neural networks (GNNs)?

The key hypothesis is that by leveraging properties of certified robustness (which was originally used for defense), the authors can design a more effective attack framework against GNNs. 

Specifically, the authors propose to:

1) Derive nodes' certified perturbation sizes against graph evasion and poisoning attacks using randomized smoothing. This indicates how robust each node is theoretically to graph perturbations.

2) Design a certified robustness inspired loss function that assigns larger weights to nodes with smaller certified perturbation sizes. This helps focus the attack on more vulnerable nodes. 

3) Develop a certified robustness attack framework that can enhance existing graph evasion and poisoning attacks by incorporating the certified robustness inspired loss.

The authors evaluate their framework on benchmark datasets by applying it to state-of-the-art attacks. Results validate that their framework can significantly improve existing attacks' performance against GNNs.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging properties of certified robustness can lead to more effective attacks against graph neural networks. The authors propose and evaluate an attack framework to validate this hypothesis.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on adversarial attacks against graph neural networks:

- It proposes a new attack framework inspired by certified robustness. Most prior work has focused on designing new attack methods, but this paper takes a novel approach of leveraging certified robustness, which was originally proposed for defending models, to create more effective attacks. 

- It generalizes certified robustness to graph poisoning attacks. Prior work on certified robustness for graphs has focused on evasion attacks. This paper extends the theory to derive certified robustness against poisoning attacks as well.

Overall, this paper offers a novel perspective on how certified robustness can be leveraged to create stronger rather than defend against attacks. The model-agnostic certified robustness inspired framework allows improving existing attack methods, which is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments. It expands the scope of certified robustness and represents an important direction for future work on adversarially robust graphs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions in the paper:

- Developing new attack methods against GNNs. The authors note that while their framework improves existing attacks, there is still room for developing novel and more effective attack algorithms specifically designed for graph data.

- Applying the certified robustness framework to design better defenses. The authors propose using certified robustness offensively to guide attacks, but it could also be used defensively to identify vulnerable regions and harden the model.

- Evaluating the attack framework on other GNN models besides GCN. The authors mainly evaluate GCN but note the framework could generalize to other GNN architectures.

- Further analysis of tradeoffs between accuracy, robustness, and computational overhead. The authors point out the computational overhead of their framework is manageable but more analysis could guide optimization.

- Developing adaptive attacks against defenses like adversarial training. The authors show adversarial training provides some defense, but adaptive attacks that take the defense into account may bypass it.

- Extension to other domains like attacking graph embedding methods. The certified robustness framework could potentially be applied beyond node classification tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are developing novel attacks and defenses leveraging insights from certified robustness, evaluating on diverse GNN models and tasks, and further optimization and analysis of the tradeoffs. The key idea of using certified robustness to guide adversarial graph perturbations could lead to many promising follow-up research studies.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new attack framework against graph neural networks (GNNs) inspired by certified robustness. The key idea is to leverage properties of certified robustness, which is typically used to defend models, to instead design more effective attacks on GNNs. Specifically, the authors first derive a node's certified perturbation size against both evasion and poisoning attacks to GNNs using randomized smoothing. This certified perturbation size indicates how robust a node is to adversarial graph perturbations - a larger size means more robust. The authors then propose to incorporate this certified perturbation information into the attack loss function. They assign node weights inversely related to the certified perturbation size, so nodes that are less robust get higher weight to make them easier to attack. Based on this certified robustness inspired loss, the authors design a general attack framework that can enhance existing evasion and poisoning attack methods for GNNs. 

The proposed certified robustness attack framework is evaluated on graph benchmark datasets using common GNN models. Results demonstrate it can significantly boost the performance of current state-of-the-art attacks like PGD evasion attack and MinMax poisoning attack. Analysis shows the framework helps focus perturbations on more vulnerable nodes. Overall, this work provides a novel perspective to leverage certified robustness properties for more effective attacks rather than defense. It also presents the first framework to generally improve graph adversarial attacks on GNNs.

The paper proposes a certified robustness inspired attack framework against graph neural networks (GNNs). The key idea is to leverage properties of certified robustness, which quantifies a model's provable robustness against adversarial attacks, to design more effective attacks against GNNs. Specifically, the method first derives nodes' certified perturbation sizes against graph evasion and poisoning attacks using randomized smoothing. Nodes with smaller certified perturbation sizes are theoretically less robust to graph perturbations. Based on this insight, the method assigns each node a weight inversely related to its certified perturbation size, and incorporates these weights into the attack loss functions of existing graph attacks like PGD evasion attack and MinMax poisoning attack. This focuses the attacks on more vulnerable nodes with smaller certified perturbation sizes. Experiments demonstrate the certified robustness inspired attacks significantly improve existing attack methods against GNNs on node classification.
