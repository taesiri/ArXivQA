# [Turning Strengths into Weaknesses: A Certified Robustness Inspired   Attack Framework against Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06199)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can we design a general attack framework that can further enhance both existing graph evasion and poisoning attacks against graph neural networks (GNNs)?

The key hypothesis is that by leveraging properties of certified robustness (which was originally used for defense), the authors can design a more effective attack framework against GNNs. 

Specifically, the authors propose to:

1) Derive nodes' certified perturbation sizes against graph evasion and poisoning attacks using randomized smoothing. This indicates how robust each node is theoretically to graph perturbations.

2) Design a certified robustness inspired loss function that assigns larger weights to nodes with smaller certified perturbation sizes. This helps focus the attack on more vulnerable nodes. 

3) Develop a certified robustness attack framework that can enhance existing graph evasion and poisoning attacks by incorporating the certified robustness inspired loss.

The authors evaluate their framework on benchmark datasets by applying it to state-of-the-art attacks. Results validate that their framework can significantly improve existing attacks' performance against GNNs.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging properties of certified robustness can lead to more effective attacks against graph neural networks. The authors propose and evaluate an attack framework to validate this hypothesis.
