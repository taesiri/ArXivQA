# [MoMa-Pos: Where Should Mobile Manipulators Stand in Cluttered   Environment Before Task Execution?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19940)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Mobile manipulators need to determine feasible base positions prior to carrying out navigation-manipulation tasks in cluttered real-world environments like homes. Efficiently computing optimal base positions is challenging as it requires considering the location of target objects relative to surrounding furniture, potential obstacles, and differences in robot models. Existing methods have limitations in computational efficiency, adaptability, and ability to accommodate environment complexities.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces a framework called MoMa-Pos that efficiently determines feasible base positions for mobile manipulators before task execution. The key components are:

1) Selective modeling: A graph embedding architecture is used to predict a small set of crucial objects around the target object for simulation. This avoids modeling all objects to improve efficiency. 

2) Potential area computation: Considers robot model, target object's position, and furniture structure to dynamically calculate a potential area for base positions. Samples positions in this area.

3) Feasible position identification: Evaluates sampled positions for feasibility using a motion planner. Determines the optimal sequence to visit positions by solving an Open Traveling Salesman Problem formulation. Selects first feasible position in sequence as final output.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework to identify feasible base positions for navigation-manipulation tasks that considers environment and robot complexities
- Selective modeling approach to improve efficiency 
- Method to compute potential areas adapting to different mobile manipulators and furniture  
- Formulation as Open TSP problem to optimize position evaluation
- Completeness guarantee under reasonable assumptions
- Extensive evaluation across different settings showing much better performance than existing techniques

The key advantage of MoMa-Pos is providing an efficient and complete method to determine feasible base positions for mobile manipulators in complex real-world environments while adapting to different robot models.
