# [On the impossibility of discovering a formula for primes using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper explores the theoretical limits of machine learning within the framework of Kolmogorov complexity theory. Specifically, it aims to address whether machine learning can be used to discover mathematical formulas and proofs, using the problem of finding a formula for prime numbers as a case study. 

Main Contributions:

1. Provides information-theoretic proofs of key results in probabilistic number theory such as the Erdős–Kac theorem on the normality of the number of prime divisors of integers, Chebyshev's theorem on primes, and the Prime Number Theorem on the distribution of primes.

2. Demonstrates an information-theoretic derivation of the Hardy–Ramanujan theorem on the normal order of the number of prime divisors of an integer.

3. Proves the "Prime Coding Theorem" which states that the expected Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence of prime locations below an integer N is on the order of N. This indicates the locations of primes behave like independent random bits. 

4. Uses the Prime Coding Theorem to prove that no formula for generating primes can be discovered through machine learning, regardless of the amount of compute power or training data available. This establishes theoretical limitations of ML for certain mathematical discoveries.

5. Provides a philosophical argument that profound mathematical theorems like the Erdős–Kac theorem which are experimentally unverifiable require creative leaps that may be beyond purely inductive ML methods.

In conclusion, the paper leverages algorithmic information theory to elucidate fundamental limits on the ability of ML to make mathematical discoveries like a prime formula, highlighting the need for incorporating creative human reasoning to advance mathematics. The information-theoretic proofs of major results in number theory are also noteworthy technical contributions.
