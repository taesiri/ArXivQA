# [Omega-Regular Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08602)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces omega-regular decision processes (ODPs) as an expressive framework for non-Markovian decision making. ODPs augment regular decision processes with "promises" made by the agent about future behavior, formalized as omega-regular lookahead properties. These promises enable the agent to obtain better rewards contingent on fulfilling qualitative long-term goals. The authors show the optimal discounted reward problem for ODPs is decidable, with complexity bounds depending on the lookahead automaton. They provide a novel construction to translate ODPs to lexicographic MDP optimization problems, leveraging good-for-MDP automata to test promise fulfillment. To enable reinforcement learning for ODPs, the construction guarantees these automata have suitable structure. Optimizations and complexity bounds for prominent cases are also analyzed. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of compiling ODPs for practical applications. Overall, ODPs and the associated synthesis algorithms integrate expressive temporal logic constraints with rewards to intuitively specify objectives and enable optimization, with translations ensuring computational tractability.
