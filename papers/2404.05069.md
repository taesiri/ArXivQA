# [AirShot: Efficient Few-Shot Detection for Autonomous Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with only a few support examples. Existing FSOD methods face challenges in reliability and efficiency, making them impractical for autonomous robot exploration. Specifically, two-stage detectors rely on inaccurate region proposals. Also, exhaustive inference loops over all potential novel classes waste computation on absent classes.  

Method - AirShot:
This paper proposes AirShot to address the reliability and efficiency challenges in FSOD via exploiting valuable correlation maps. AirShot contains a Top Prediction Filter (TPF) module with two key functions:

Training: TPF supervises correlation map generation for more reliable features. This is done by contrastive learning to classify category existence from the maps.  

Inference: TPF selects a subset of top-ranked classes via confidence scores to reduce looping iterations. Only the top classes undergo feature fusion and detection.

The insight is that intermediate supervision on global correlation maps extracts additional information from limited data. Also, pre-selecting likely categories cuts unnecessary computation.

Contributions:
1. Exploits correlation maps for more robust and faster FSOD system, widely boosting various off-the-shelf models.

2. TPF offers dual functionality: improves supervision during training and enables efficient inference via pre-selection.

3. State-of-the-art on COCO and Pascal VOC. 36.4% AP gain and 56.3% faster on robot platforms, superior for autonomous exploration.

The proposed AirShot paradigm addresses key limitations in applying FSOD methods to real-world robot exploration. By reliably extracting information from limited data and avoiding wasted inference computation, AirShot advances the feasibility of on-device few-shot detection for robots discovering novel objects.
