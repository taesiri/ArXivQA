# [Opening Cabinets and Drawers in the Real World using a Commodity Mobile   Manipulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Opening and manipulating articulated objects like cabinets and drawers in novel real-world environments presents several challenges in perception, planning, and control for robots. Key issues include accurately perceiving the articulation parameters (e.g. handle location, radius of rotation) using on-board sensors, planning motions that conform to the constraints imposed by those parameters, and executing the plan robustly despite inaccuracies. 

Proposed Solution: The authors develop an end-to-end system on a Stretch RE2 mobile manipulator to address these challenges. Their system has three key components:

1) Perception module using a customized Mask R-CNN architecture that takes an RGB-D image as input and detects cabinets/drawers, predicts articulation parameters like handle location, surface normal, radius of rotation etc. in the camera frame. These 3D predictions are transformed to the robot's base frame.

2) Planning module that builds on prior work SeqIK to generate a whole-body motion plan consisting of base movement and arm trajectory to grasp the handle and open the cabinet/drawer. The plan conforms to the constraint defined by the predicted handle trajectory.

3) Execution module that uses proprioceptive feedback and contact-detection based heuristics to adapt and improve the initial pre-grasp pose before manipulating the object open. This helps deal with inaccuracies in perception and navigation.

The system is tested on a testbed spanning 10 buildings and 31 cabinets/drawers in novel environments and achieves a 61% zero-shot success rate in opening them. Analysis of different failure modes reveals perception errors as the biggest bottleneck. Control is surprisingly robust to misestimation of articulation parameters once a firm grasp is achieved.

Main Contributions:
1) An end-to-end system for opening cabinets/drawers in novel environments on a commodity mobile manipulator with no hardware modifications
2) Large-scale real-world experiments spanning diverse environments and analysis of failure modes
3) Insights like surprising robustness of control to perception inaccuracies, and perception being the current bottleneck


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents the design and real-world evaluation of an end-to-end mobile manipulation system using a commodity robot that can pull open previously unseen cabinets and drawers in diverse novel environments, achieving a 61% zero-shot success rate across 13 test sites with 31 distinct articulated objects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The design and evaluation of an end-to-end system that enables a commodity mobile manipulator (Stretch RE2) to pull open cabinets and drawers in diverse, previously unseen real world environments. The system is tested on 31 different cabinets and drawers across 13 different test sites (10 buildings) and achieves a 61% zero-shot success rate. The analysis of the failure modes provides guidance for building similar systems and reveals that errors in perception are currently the biggest bottleneck.

In summary, the key contributions are:

1) An end-to-end system for opening cabinets/drawers using a commodity robot in unseen environments 

2) Extensive real-world testing across diverse settings (31 objects in 13 sites)

3) Quantitative analysis of the performance and failure modes to provide insights for future work

4) Demonstrating a 61% zero-shot success rate with the current system

The main focus is on designing, building and evaluating a complete system for this task and using the learnings to provide guidance to the community.

The paper presents an end-to-end system for a commodity mobile manipulator (Stretch RE2) to open cabinets and drawers in novel real-world environments. Key aspects include perceiving the articulation parameters of cabinets/drawers, generating motion plans to open them, and using contact-based feedback to adapt the plans during execution. The system is tested extensively on 31 real articulated objects across 13 unseen environments, in a zero-shot generalization setting, achieving a 61% success rate. The analysis also reveals insights into the failure modes and future directions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a modular approach combining perception, planning, and control modules. What were the key challenges and insights in getting these modules to work well together in practice? How tightly coupled are the modules?

2. The perception module is based on Mask R-CNN. What modifications were made to the standard Mask R-CNN architecture to enable it to predict articulation parameters? How was the model trained using the ArtObjSim dataset?

3. The planning module extends prior work on SeqIK for motion planning. What changes were made to adapt SeqIK to work with the Stretch RE2 robot and to produce whole-body motion plans? How is the initial robot configuration selected?

4. The method relies heavily on making and maintaining contact with the handle while opening the cabinet/drawer. What contact-based adaptation strategies were developed? How does the system detect contact and use proprioceptive feedback? 

5. What were some of the key insights regarding the interaction between perception and control? How robust is the execution to inaccuracies in the predicted articulation parameters? What level of accuracy is needed?

6. The system was tested extensively on 31 real-world cabinet/drawer opening tasks. What was the overall success rate? How did the results vary across different articulation types and environments? What were the main failure modes observed?

7. One set of experiments studied the effectiveness of the contact-based adaptation strategies. What was their impact on success rate? When were they most helpful?

8. The vertical handle primitive motion was designed specifically for handles with vertical orientations. What does this motion entail? What was the impact of including this primitive? When was it needed?

9. The method relies on finding suitable navigation targets for positioning. How were these targets determined in a data-driven manner? Were any other constraints needed on navigation?

10. The discussion highlights limitations of the current system and areas for future work. What are 2-3 promising research directions that could help address some of the remaining challenges?
