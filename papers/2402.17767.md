# [Opening Cabinets and Drawers in the Real World using a Commodity Mobile   Manipulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Opening and manipulating articulated objects like cabinets and drawers in novel real-world environments presents several challenges in perception, planning, and control for robots. Key issues include accurately perceiving the articulation parameters (e.g. handle location, radius of rotation) using on-board sensors, planning motions that conform to the constraints imposed by those parameters, and executing the plan robustly despite inaccuracies. 

Proposed Solution: The authors develop an end-to-end system on a Stretch RE2 mobile manipulator to address these challenges. Their system has three key components:

1) Perception module using a customized Mask R-CNN architecture that takes an RGB-D image as input and detects cabinets/drawers, predicts articulation parameters like handle location, surface normal, radius of rotation etc. in the camera frame. These 3D predictions are transformed to the robot's base frame.

2) Planning module that builds on prior work SeqIK to generate a whole-body motion plan consisting of base movement and arm trajectory to grasp the handle and open the cabinet/drawer. The plan conforms to the constraint defined by the predicted handle trajectory.

3) Execution module that uses proprioceptive feedback and contact-detection based heuristics to adapt and improve the initial pre-grasp pose before manipulating the object open. This helps deal with inaccuracies in perception and navigation.

The system is tested on a testbed spanning 10 buildings and 31 cabinets/drawers in novel environments and achieves a 61% zero-shot success rate in opening them. Analysis of different failure modes reveals perception errors as the biggest bottleneck. Control is surprisingly robust to misestimation of articulation parameters once a firm grasp is achieved.

Main Contributions:
1) An end-to-end system for opening cabinets/drawers in novel environments on a commodity mobile manipulator with no hardware modifications
2) Large-scale real-world experiments spanning diverse environments and analysis of failure modes
3) Insights like surprising robustness of control to perception inaccuracies, and perception being the current bottleneck
