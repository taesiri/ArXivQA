# [MAP: MAsk-Pruning for Source-Free Model Intellectual Property Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04149)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models require huge investments to develop, so protecting their intellectual property (IP) is important. 
- Existing methods for model IP protection require access to both source (authorized) data and target (unauthorized) data. This is inefficient and risks privacy.
- There is a need for practical methods that can achieve model IP protection without requiring access to source data (source-free) or even any data (data-free).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Mask Pruning (MAP) framework for model IP protection.
- MAP is based on an "Inverse Transfer Parameter Hypothesis": well-trained models contain parameters specific to certain data domains. Pruning those parameters can restrict generalization capability to those domains for IP protection, while minimizing impact on other domains.

- Three versions of MAP are presented:
  - SA-MAP: Requires access to source data (verification)
  - SF-MAP: Source-free, uses target data and generators to synthesize pseudo-source data
  - DF-MAP: Data-free, uses diversity generator to create auxiliary domains

- All variants freeze the source model weights and learn a binary mask to prune target-specific parameters from the model copy, restricting its generalization capacity.

Main Contributions:
- First solution for source-free and data-free model IP protection, important for privacy.
- Novel MAP framework stemming from the Inverse Transfer Parameter Hypothesis.
- SA-MAP for source-available verification, SF-MAP for source-free case, DF-MAP for data-free case. 
- Introduction of new metric (ST-D) for evaluating both source and target performance.
- Experiments showing MAP variants outperform baselines on digit and image datasets for model IP protection.

In summary, the paper proposes a versatile MAP framework to achieve model IP protection without needing access to source data or any data, overcoming limitations of prior arts. Evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness.
