# [S-VolSDF: Sparse Multi-View Stereo Regularization of Neural Implicit   Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17712)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: How can we improve multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction quality when only sparse input views are available?The key hypothesis is that incorporating sparse MVS information as a regularizer during test-time optimization of a neural radiance field model can help resolve the shape-radiance ambiguity problem that occurs with sparse views. Specifically, the paper proposes that using the MVS probability volume as supervision for the neural radiance field's volume density can improve geometry reconstruction.In summary, the paper aims to show that combining strengths of MVS (explicit multi-view constraints) and neural radiance fields (strong priors and differentiability) through a novel regularization approach can achieve better 3D reconstruction from sparse views compared to either method alone. The experiments then validate this hypothesis on standard datasets.
