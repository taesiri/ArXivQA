# [Context Diffusion: In-Context Aware Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03584)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Context Diffusion: In-Context Aware Image Generation":

Problem:
- Recent work on in-context learning for image generation relies too much on text prompts and struggles when prompts are absent. For example, Prompt Diffusion requires both source-target image pairs and text prompts as input. Without prompts, it cannot effectively learn from visual examples.
- Existing methods also do not support using multiple context images, limiting the visual information that can guide generation.

Proposed Solution:
- Context Diffusion framework that can learn from both visual context examples and text prompts, as well as either one alone.
- Visual context consists of one or more "target" images that provide visual characteristics like style, texture, colors. Query image provides structure.
- Encodes text prompt similarly to existing methods. Encodes visual context using the same pretrained image encoder and inserts embeddings alongside text.
- Trains using six image generation tasks with generated images and maps. Supports variable number of context images.

Main Contributions:
- Can generate quality images using visual context, text prompts, or both. Handles scenarios when one modality is missing.
- Enables use of multiple context images in a "few-shot" setup. First work exploring this for in-context image generation.
- Extensive experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain tasks demonstrate improved performance over Prompt Diffusion in image quality and fidelity.
- User study also shows significant gains, especially on out-of-domain tasks and when using only visual context.

In summary, the paper proposes a more flexible framework for in-context aware image generation that can leverage both visual examples and text guidance to handle diverse tasks. Key advantages are better generalization and not relying solely on textual prompts.
