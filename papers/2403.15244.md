# [A Stochastic Quasi-Newton Method for Non-convex Optimization with   Non-uniform Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Many machine learning problems exhibit non-uniform smoothness, where the smoothness factor (upper bound on the Hessian norm) grows with the gradient norm during training. 
- This violates the common assumption of uniform smoothness made in convergence analyses of optimization algorithms.
- Existing stochastic first-order methods achieve optimal sample complexity under non-uniform smoothness by using gradient clipping. But stochastic quasi-Newton (SQN) methods have not been studied.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a stochastic quasi-Newton framework with gradient clipping for non-uniformly smooth non-convex optimization. 
- Use techniques like variance reduction and adaptive step size to achieve fast convergence.  
- Generate positive definite Hessian inverse approximation using an adaptive L-BFGS method with tunable eigenvalues. This controls the condition number and sample complexity.

Main Contributions:
- First SQN method for non-uniform smoothness that achieves optimal $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity to find an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point.
- Convergence analysis proving the sample complexity bound.
- Adaptive L-BFGS method to generate Hessian inverse approximation with tunable eigenvalues, allowing control over convergence speed.
- Numerical experiments showing the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on non-convex regression and classification tasks.

In summary, the paper proposes an stochastic quasi-Newton framework customized for non-uniform smoothness that enjoys fast convergence and optimal sample complexity along with easy ways to control the speed through tuning relevant parameters.
