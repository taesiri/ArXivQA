# [Extension of Recurrent Kernels to different Reservoir Computing   topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
This paper aims to extend the concept of Recurrent Kernels, originally proposed for standard Reservoir Computing, to other variants such as Leaky Reservoir Computing, Sparse Reservoir Computing, and Deep Reservoir Computing. Recurrent Kernels provide a deterministic limit for Reservoir Computing systems when the number of neurons goes to infinity. Analyzing this limit helps understand the expressive power and compare different Reservoir Computing architectures. However, many common Reservoir Computing variants have not yet been studied from the Recurrent Kernel perspective.  

Proposed Solution
The authors derive Recurrent Kernel formulations corresponding to Leaky Reservoir Computing, Sparse Reservoir Computing, and Deep Reservoir Computing architectures.

For Sparse RC, they show the limit is the same as standard RC, implying sparse connections do not affect expressive power. 

For Leaky RC, they define a Recurrent Kernel dependent on the leak rate parameter.

For Deep RC, they recursively define kernels for each reservoir layer that capture the hierarchical dynamics.

They then empirically evaluate the convergence of these Reservoir Computing variants to their respective Recurrent Kernel limits through numerical simulations, for different activation functions.

Main Contributions
- Definition of Recurrent Kernel formulations for Leaky RC, Sparse RC and Deep RC
- Convergence analysis showing Sparse RC achieves the same performance as standard RC
- Study of optimal sparsity levels as a function of reservoir size  
- Guidelines for setting reservoir sizes in Deep RC: first reservoirs can be slightly larger than later ones 

The extensions of Recurrent Kernels provide insights into common Reservoir Computing architectures and their comparison to a deterministic limit. The convergence analysis offers practical guidelines for hyperparameter tuning in these models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper extends the concept of Recurrent Kernels, deterministic limits of large Reservoir Computing models, to other Reservoir Computing architectures such as Leaky, Sparse, and Deep Reservoir Computing, analyzes their convergence theoretically and empirically, and provides insights into choosing hyperparameters like sparsity levels and reservoir sizes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Defining the Recurrent Kernel limit for Leaky RC, Sparse RC, and Deep RC.

2. Conducting a thorough numerical study on the convergence of these RC paradigms to their Recurrent Kernel counterparts, for different activation functions. 

3. Showing that sparse RC is equivalent to the non-sparse case, as long as the sparsity rate is above a certain threshold. This suggests sparse RC does not have increased or decreased expressivity compared to vanilla RC.

4. Demonstrating that in Deep Reservoir Computing, first reservoirs should be larger than subsequent ones in order to decrease the amount of noise transmitted in the subsequent layers. However, this effect is quite small and reservoirs with equal sizes should perform similarly in practice.

So in summary, the main contribution is extending the concept of Recurrent Kernels to other Reservoir Computing topologies beyond vanilla RC, and analyzing their convergence and properties empirically. This helps better understand the role of different architectures in RC.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods in this paper:

1) The paper shows that sparse random recurrent kernels have the same expressive power as dense recurrent kernels in the limit of large reservoir size. What is the intuition behind this result? Does adding structured sparsity change this theoretical equivalence?

2) The paper proposes an optimal sparse connectivity that depends on the reservoir size. What drives this relationship? Is there a simple rule-of-thumb to set the sparsity rate for a given reservoir size? 

3) For leaky recurrent kernels, what causes the smaller region of convergence compared to vanilla recurrent kernels, especially for unbounded activations like ReLU? How do the leak rate and spectral radius interact here?

4) The paper finds deep recurrent kernels perform best when first reservoirs are slightly larger. What causes this effect? Is there an optimal ratio between consecutive reservoir sizes that minimizes approximation error?

5) Could you extend the analysis to other variants of reservoir computing, such as intrinsic plasticity, strategic reservoirs, or physical reservoirs? What new challenges might arise in deriving their equivalent recurrent kernel formulations?

6) The paper relies on a numerical convergence study. What are the main theoretical obstacles to formally proving convergence for these reservoir computing architectures?  

7) For practical implementations, how should one choose between using large sparse reservoir computing and the equivalent smaller recurrent kernel? What are the tradeoffs in computation time, memory usage, and accuracy?

8) The recurrent kernel limit requires computing the kernel between all pairs of inputs. Could random Fourier features help scale recurrent kernels to much larger datasets? How might this change the approximation guarantees?

9) How sensitive is the performance of the different recurrent computing architectures to deviations from the theoretical assumptions, such as weight distributions or time independence? 

10) The paper focuses on fully-connected architectures. Could you extend the analysis to other connectivity structures like cycles or layers? Would the same performance equivalence hold in those cases?
