# [DNA Family: Boosting Weight-Sharing NAS with Block-Wise Supervisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01326)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS) methods have high efficiency but suffer from low search effectiveness. The paper analyzes this issue using a generalization boundedness tool and shows that the extensive search space leads to poor generalization ability of the supernet weights, resulting in unreliable architecture ratings and ineffective searches. 

Proposed Solution:  
To address this issue, the authors propose to modularize the large search space into blocks with small search spaces using a block-wise representation. This allows more reliable architecture ratings within each block. Based on the block-wise representations, they develop three NAS models using distilling neural architecture (DNA) techniques:

1) DNA: Uses supervised learning where the features of a fixed teacher network supervise the training of student supernets. Allows searchable width/depth and resource adaptability.

2) DNA+: Allows the teacher network to be progressively updated by scaling up the searched architecture from the previous generation. Less dependent on the initial teacher capacity.

3) DNA++: Uses self-supervised learning to replace the teacher supervision. Solves issues like architecture shifts between teacher and students.

Together these form the DNA family for resolving various NAS dilemmas.

Main Contributions:

- Analyze the root cause behind the ineffectiveness of weight-sharing NAS methods.

- Propose modularizing the search space into blocks and develop DNA models for reliable architecture ratings.

- DNA models can rate all candidates unlike previous works restricted to sub-spaces. Also allow searching architectures with varying depths/widths.  

- Highlight significance of architecture rating via comprehensive studies on metrics like Kendall Tau.

- State-of-the-art results on ImageNet (78.9% top-1 in mobile setting, 83.6% for ViT), CIFAR, and segmentation tasks.

In summary, the paper provides an excellent analysis of issues with weight-sharing NAS and proposes an effective DNA framework to enhance architecture search through reliable ratings. Compelling results on multiple tasks showcase the merits of this technique.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a DNA family of neural architecture search methods that modularize the search space into blocks and employ distilling neural architecture techniques like supervised, progressive, and self-supervised learning to enable effective and efficient architecture search.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies the issue of unreliable architecture ranking caused by the vast search space as a key factor hampering the effectiveness of weight-sharing NAS methods. To address this, it proposes a solution to modularize the extensive search space into blocks, thereby systematically reducing the search scope.

2. It explores three implementations (DNA, DNA+, DNA++) under the general knowledge distillation framework to balance scalability, efficiency, and compatibility with different neural network structures. This DNA family of models can resolve various dilemmas in NAS applications. 

3. The block-wise supervisions in the DNA family enable assessing all candidate architectures, unlike prior works that could only explore a subset of the search space. It also allows searching for architectures with varying depths and widths under computational constraints.

4. It provides extensive empirical analysis and insights into neural architecture rating through comprehensive studies on metrics like model ranking, Kendall Tau evaluations, and training stability assessment. These offer insights into the (in)effectiveness of conventional weight-sharing NAS.

5. It demonstrates state-of-the-art results across tasks like ImageNet classification, CIFAR classification, semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC and ADE20K, and object detection on MSCOCO.

In summary, the core contribution is the proposal of the DNA family to address the architecture rating challenge, which is a pivotal weakness affecting NAS effectiveness. This is achieved via techniques like modularizing the search space and block-wise supervised/progressive/self-supervised learning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Neural Architecture Search (NAS) - The paper focuses on techniques to automatically design neural network architectures rather than relying on human experts. 

- Weight-sharing NAS - A category of NAS methods that greatly improves search efficiency by encoding the search space into a weight-sharing supernet and training all architectures concurrently. However, these methods suffer from low search effectiveness.

- Generalization boundedness - A theoretical tool used in the paper to demonstrate how the excessive search space hampers the effectiveness of weight-sharing NAS methods by reducing the generalization capability of the supernet weights. 

- Block-wise learning - The paper proposes to modularize the large search space into blocks with small search spaces to improve architecture rating reliability. Three distilling neural architecture (DNA) models are then developed using block-wise supervisions.

- DNA family - The name given to the three proposed NAS models: DNA (supervised learning), DNA+ (progressive learning), and DNA++ (self-supervised learning). They resolve various weight-sharing NAS dilemmas.

- Architecture rating - The paper provides extensive analysis on the pivotal role of reliably rating candidate neural architectures in determining NAS effectiveness, which is addressed by the block-wise learning approach.

In summary, the core focus is on boosting neural architecture search via block-wise modularization of the search space and distilling neural architecture techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes to modularize the neural architecture search (NAS) space into blocks in order to reduce the search space size. How does this modularization impact the ability to find globally optimal architectures compared to searching the full space directly?

2. The paper introduces three variants of the proposed Distilling Neural Architecture (DNA) method - DNA, DNA+ and DNA++. What are the key differences between these three variants and what are the relative advantages/disadvantages of each? 

3. The DNA family of methods employs knowledge distillation techniques. How does the choice of teacher network architecture and capacity impact the quality of the student architectures found during search?

4. The paper argues that neural architecture search spaces have become too large, hampering search efficiency and effectiveness. Do you think techniques like DNA could enable scaling up NAS spaces even further or is there a limit?

5. How does the proposed block-wise supervision technique compare to other methods that aim to improve the accuracy of architecture ranking such as Bayesian NAS? What are the relative pros and cons?

6. Could the idea of self-supervision in DNA++ be combined with the progressive learning strategy of DNA+ to further enhance performance? What difficulties might this combination introduce?

7. The DNA family is evaluated on the mobile inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv) search space. How do you think its effectiveness would change on other cell-based search spaces like DARTS?

8. The paper demonstrates NAS for vision transformers using the DNA framework. Do you think the method can generalize well to NAS for other architectures like LSTMs or Transformers in NLP?

9. What enhancements could be made to the proposed algorithms for rating and searching architectures to improve efficiency further? 

10. The paper provides an analysis connecting architecture search space size to ranking quality. Do you think there are other factors besides search space size that substantially impact ranking accuracy?
