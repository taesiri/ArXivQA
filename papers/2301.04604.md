# [LinkGAN: Linking GAN Latents to Pixels for Controllable Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04604)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: How can we build an explicit linkage between the latent space and spatial regions in the image during GAN training, so as to achieve more controllable and convenient local editing of GAN image synthesis?The key points are:- Most prior work tries to discover latent semantics from pre-trained GANs, which suffers from instability, inaccuracy, and inflexibility. - This paper proposes a new perspective - introducing a regularizer during GAN training to explicitly link some latent axes to a set of image pixels.- The regularizer enables altering image content in the linked region by simply resampling the corresponding latent axes.- Experiments show this explicit linkage can be built for arbitrary regions, enables independent control of multiple regions, works for both 2D and 3D GANs, and maintains compatibility with GAN inversion.In summary, the core hypothesis is that introducing an explicit latent-pixel linkage regularizer during training can achieve more accurate and flexible spatial control for GAN image synthesis. The experiments aim to demonstrate the viability and benefits of this approach.
