# [User Satisfaction Estimation with Sequential Dialogue Act Modeling in   Goal-oriented Conversational Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02912)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can the sequential dynamics of dialogue acts be leveraged to facilitate user satisfaction estimation (USE) in goal-oriented conversational systems?

The key points are:

- User satisfaction in goal-oriented dialogues depends on whether the system successfully meets the user's needs and goals. 

- Dialogue acts, representing user intents/actions at each turn, can reflect the fulfillment of user goals.

- But prior work neglects the sequential transitions between dialogue acts.

Thus the paper proposes to model the sequential dynamics of dialogue acts to better estimate user satisfaction in goal-oriented systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel method called USDA to jointly learn user satisfaction estimation (USE) and dialogue act recognition (DAR) in goal-oriented conversational systems. The key contributions are:

- It leverages the sequential dynamics of dialogue acts to improve USE via joint learning with DAR. Both supervised and unsupervised DAR modules are developed to handle situations with or without dialogue act annotations. 

- It introduces two self-supervised pre-training strategies - system response selection (SRS) and dialogue incoherence detection (DID) to enhance the dialogue modeling capability of the model without extra human annotation.

- Experiments on 4 goal-oriented dialogue datasets show USDA outperforms existing methods on USE. Analyses also reveal the correlation between dialogue act sequences and user satisfaction.

- It provides a new perspective to understand user dis/satisfaction by modeling dialogue act transitions in goal-oriented conversations.

In summary, the main contribution is using the sequential dynamics of dialogue acts to improve user satisfaction estimation via joint learning, and showing its effectiveness over strong baselines on multiple real-world datasets. The self-supervised pre-training and interpretability of dialogue act sequences also enhance the proposed model.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called USDA to leverage sequential dynamics of dialogue acts to improve user satisfaction estimation in goal-oriented conversational systems, through joint modeling of user satisfaction prediction and dialogue act recognition in a unified framework.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in user satisfaction estimation for goal-oriented conversational systems:

- This paper proposes a novel approach of jointly modeling user satisfaction estimation and dialogue act recognition. Most prior work has treated these two tasks separately or in a pipeline approach. Jointly modeling them allows the tasks to mutually benefit each other. This is a unique contribution compared to other work.

- The paper evaluates the method on multiple goal-oriented dialogue datasets from different domains (task-oriented, conversational recommendation, customer service). Showing consistent improvements across domains demonstrates the broad applicability of the approach. In contrast, much prior work focuses evaluation on only one dataset/domain. 

- The paper introduces two self-supervised pre-training strategies (response selection and dialogue incoherence detection) to enhance the dialogue modeling capabilities of the model. Using self-supervised strategies for "in-domain" pre-training is an interesting technique not explored much by other satisfaction estimation papers.

- For dialogue act modeling, the paper proposes both a supervised variant using labelled acts and an unsupervised clustering approach when labels are unavailable. Being able to handle both situations increases the flexibility of the method compared to those requiring annotated dialogue acts.

- The analysis of feature importance and correlations between predicted dialogue acts and satisfaction provides useful insights. Other papers in this field tend to lack detailed analysis into what the models are learning.

Overall, I would say the key novelties are the joint modeling approach, use of self-supervised pre-training, flexibility to handle labelled/unlabelled dialogue acts, and detailed analysis providing interpretability. The variety of evaluations across domains is also a notable strength.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring the causes of user dissatisfaction in more detail, in order to better evaluate and improve goal-oriented conversational systems. The authors suggest investigating this with real users, building on the insights from the proposed simulation approach.

- Extending the proposed methods to other types of conversational systems beyond the goal-oriented systems studied in this paper, such as chit-chat systems.

- Incorporating additional sources of information beyond just dialogue acts into the user satisfaction modeling, such as other types of user intents, emotions, semantics, etc. 

- Studying the sequential dynamics of user satisfaction within a conversation, rather than just predicting the overall satisfaction. The transitions between satisfied/dissatisfied states could reveal more insights.

- Evaluating the proposed approach in real-world conversational systems and studying the effects on user experience.

- Developing personalized models of user satisfaction tailored to individual users' preferences and dialogue patterns.

- Exploring different model architectures and self-supervised pre-training strategies to further improve the joint modeling of user satisfaction estimation and dialogue act recognition.

In summary, the key directions are: analyzing causes of dissatisfaction, extending to other conversational system types, incorporating additional user signals, modeling sequential satisfaction dynamics, real-world evaluation, personalization, and improvements to model architecture/training.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called USDA to jointly learn user satisfaction estimation (USE) and dialogue act recognition (DAR) in goal-oriented conversational systems. The key idea is to leverage the sequential dynamics of dialogue acts to help estimate user satisfaction, as the fulfillment of user intents reflected by dialogue acts is essential to satisfaction. USDA employs a hierarchical transformer encoder to represent the dialogue context, and develops supervised learning and unsupervised learning variants for DAR based on the availability of dialogue act labels. It further introduces two self-supervised pretraining tasks to enhance the dialogue modeling capability. Experiments on four goal-oriented dialogue datasets validate the effectiveness of using sequential dialogue act modeling to improve satisfaction estimation. The analyses also reveal the correlation between dialogue act sequences and user satisfaction. Overall, USDA provides a new perspective of utilizing dialogue acts, especially the transitions, to understand user satisfaction in conversational systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called USDA to leverage the sequential dynamics of dialogue acts to improve user satisfaction estimation (USE) in goal-oriented conversational systems. The method jointly learns USE and dialogue act recognition (DAR) in a unified framework. There are two variants: USDA (MTL) which does supervised learning of DAR given ground truth labels, and USDA (CLU) which does unsupervised DAR using a latent subspace clustering module when labels are unavailable. 

The method uses a hierarchical transformer encoder to represent the dialogue context. For DAR it can either use a sequence labeling module (supervised) or a clustering module (unsupervised). It then uses attentive RNNs to model dialogue transition features from both the content and predicted acts, and aggregates them to predict satisfaction. The framework is trained end-to-end. Additionally, two self-supervised pretraining tasks are proposed to enhance the encoder's dialogue modeling capability. Experiments on four goal-oriented dialogue datasets show the method outperforms existing approaches for USE. Analyses also reveal the importance of modeling the sequential dynamics of dialogue acts for estimating user satisfaction.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called USDA to jointly model user satisfaction estimation (USE) and dialogue act recognition (DAR) in goal-oriented conversational systems. It consists of a hierarchical transformer encoder to learn representations of the dialogue context, including an exchange-level BERT encoder and a dialogue-level transformer encoder. For DAR, it supports both supervised learning given dialogue act labels, and unsupervised learning using a latent subspace clustering module when labels are unavailable. After obtaining content and dialogue act features, it employs attentive RNNs to model their transitions and dynamics within the conversation. The content and act features are aggregated via a gated attention mechanism to predict user satisfaction. The two tasks are trained jointly in a multi-task learning framework to leverage their interrelations and mutual enhancement. Additionally, two self-supervised pre-training tasks of system response selection and dialogue incoherence detection are proposed to enhance the dialogue modeling capability.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 From my understanding, the key points of the paper are:

- The paper aims to improve user satisfaction estimation (USE) in goal-oriented conversational systems by utilizing the sequential dynamics of dialogue acts. 

- Previous works on USE often treat it as a sentiment analysis or response quality assessment task based solely on content features. However, user satisfaction depends on whether the system meets the user's needs/goals, which can be reflected through dialogue acts.

- Existing methods have limitations in dialogue act recognition (DAR) and do not consider the sequential transitions between dialogue acts over the conversation.

- The paper proposes a new method called USDA to jointly learn USE and DAR in a unified framework. It captures both content features and sequential dialogue act features to predict user satisfaction.

- USDA has two variants - supervised using dialogue act labels, and unsupervised using latent dialogue act clustering when labels are unavailable. 

- Two self-supervised pretraining tasks are introduced to enhance dialogue modeling - system response selection and dialogue incoherence detection.

- Experiments on 4 goal-oriented dialogue datasets show USDA outperforms existing methods on USE. Analyses also reveal the relationships between content, dialogue acts, and user satisfaction.

In summary, the key contribution is a joint learning framework to incorporate sequential dialogue act dynamics to improve user satisfaction estimation in goal-oriented conversational systems.
