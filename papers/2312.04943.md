# [UAV Path Planning for Object Observation with Quality Constraints: A   Dynamic Programming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04943)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper addresses the problem of planning an optimal path for a UAV to observe a set of objects, while meeting observation quality constraints. The objects have restricted observation angles and distances. A dynamic programming-based algorithm with a (1+Îµ)-approximation ratio is proposed that minimizes path length given an observing order of objects. The algorithm runs in polynomial time. Several methods are presented to determine good observing orders, with the generalized TSP heuristic performing the best. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate near optimal performance, with approximation ratios around 1.5 in most test cases. Trials in the AirSim simulator further validate the approach, using optical character recognition on images captured by the UAV to quantify observation quality. The algorithm is shown to be effective at reducing path lengths of initial routes while meeting quality thresholds. Key strengths are the consideration of observation quality constraints, theoretical approximation guarantee, and experimental validation in a realistic simulation environment.
