# [Model Evaluation for Domain Identification of Unknown Classes in   Open-World Recognition: A Proposal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Open-world recognition (OWR) models need to not only classify known classes but also reject unknown classes and continually learn. However, not all rejected classes may be relevant to the model's domain of interest. 
- Hence, there is a need for OWR models in domain-specific tasks to identify whether a rejected sample belongs to the in-domain (ID) or out-of-domain (OOD) categories. This allows continual learning on only ID samples.
- Existing works have not evaluated models on their capability to separate ID vs OOD unknowns.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an evaluation protocol to estimate a model's capability to separate unknown ID and OOD samples. 
- Three approaches are evaluated using this protocol across five domains (garbage, food, dogs, plants, birds):
  1) Transfer learning with linear classifier
  2) Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
  3) Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifier using clusters from First Integer Neighbor Clustering Hierarchy (FINCH)
- The Balanced Accuracy (BACCU) metric is used to assess performance.

Main Contributions:
- First study to tackle the problem of separating unknown ID vs unknown OOD classes to support OWR in domain-specific tasks
- Proposal of an evaluation protocol for this problem using multiple domains and assessment approaches
- Analysis of three potential baselines - transfer learning, AutoML and NCM+FINCH based classifier
- Investigation into how different pre-trained models perform for ID vs OOD separation across the domains and approaches
- Key observation that strong representations are important for ID vs OOD separation, beyond classifier complexity

In summary, this paper formalizes and provides a benchmark for the problem of separating in-domain vs out-of-domain unknowns to facilitate open-world recognition in domain-specific applications.
