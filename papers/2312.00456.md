# [Auto-encoding GPS data to reveal individual and collective behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00456)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to learn low-dimensional latent representations of fishing vessel GPS trajectories. The CVAE model takes into account covariates like time of year to reduce variability in the representations. The latent distributions are then compared using the Bhattacharyya coefficient to quantify similarity of individual vessel behaviors over time or collective behaviors between vessels. To study collective behavior, proximity graphs are constructed between vessels with similar CVAE latent distributions, and a stochastic block model is applied to detect groups with consistent behavior over multiple time periods. Application to French fishing vessels shows the method can identify groups exhibiting different spatial patterns and economic performance. Key advantages are avoiding hand-crafted trajectory metrics, capturing uncertainty via distributions, and flexibility to study both individual stability and collective clustering. Overall, this unsupervised approach effectively reveals spatio-temporal patterns and relationships from low-dimensional encodings of complex trajectory data.
