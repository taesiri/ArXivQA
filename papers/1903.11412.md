# [Self-Supervised Learning via Conditional Motion Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11412)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that learning image representations by predicting dense motion from static images conditioned on sparse motion guidance can lead to effective feature learning without explicit supervision. Specifically, the paper proposes a conditional motion propagation (CMP) framework that contains three modules - an image encoder, a sparse motion encoder, and a dense motion decoder. The goal is to predict full image motion based on the image and some sparse guidance motion vectors. The key ideas behind this approach are:- Using sparse motion guidance during training resolves the inherent ambiguity in predicting motion from static images alone, making the pretext task easier.- Recovering dense motion conditioned on sparse guidance encourages the image encoder to learn about the kinematic structure and properties of objects, so it can propagate motion appropriately.- This results in learning useful image representations without needing manual labels, as demonstrated by strong performance on downstream tasks like segmentation.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that framing self-supervised representation learning as conditional motion propagation will enable effectively learning about visual structures without explicit supervision. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the design of the CMP framework and experiments on various benchmarks.
