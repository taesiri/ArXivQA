# [Backbone-based Dynamic Graph Spatio-Temporal Network for Epidemic   Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00485)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Backbone-based Dynamic Graph Spatio-Temporal Network (BDGSTN) for accurate epidemic forecasting. It constructs a dynamic graph by separately learning a backbone graph to capture stable structural patterns and a temporal graph to represent dynamic changes. These are then fused to generate an integrated dynamic graph with enhanced representation power. BDGSTN employs a linear DLinear model based on time series decomposition to effectively capture temporal dependencies, avoiding issues with recurrent models. It also leverages graph convolutional networks with the dynamic graph to model spatial influences between regions. Additionally, BDGSTN incorporates epidemiological domain knowledge constraints for better epidemic dynamics learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of BDGSTN across multiple forecast horizons on two real-world datasets. Ablation studies verify the efficacy of key components like the backbone-based dynamic graph generation, loss function and DLinear. The paper also analyzes the roles of backbone and temporal graphs using information-theoretic metrics. Overall, BDGSTN advances spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting through an innovative dynamic graph construction approach and efficient linear modeling of dependencies.
