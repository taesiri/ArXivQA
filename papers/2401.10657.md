# [FIMBA: Evaluating the Robustness of AI in Genomics via Feature   Importance Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10657)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the increasing use of AI in genomics and clinical applications, there is a growing need to ensure these models are robust and secure. However, research on security risks and model robustness in genomics remains limited. This paper aims to demonstrate the vulnerability of common AI models used in genomics by attacking them.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a black-box attack method called Feature Importance Adversarial Attack (FIMBA) that focuses on transforming input features to reduce model accuracy and increase false positives/negatives. 

The key steps are:
1) Select samples that are falsely classified by the model (false pos/neg) 
2) Compute similarity between the false samples and correctly classified samples using nearest neighbor search
3) Select the most influential features to modify using SHAP values 
4) Interpolate between the false and correct samples on those features to generate attack samples

They also propose a variational autoencoder method to generate synthetic poisoned data for insertion into pipelines.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce a black-box attack framework to evaluate robustness of AI models in genomics
- Demonstrate success in attacking 5 common models (random forest, XGBoost, CNN, ResNet, ViT) on two real-world genomics datasets
- Achieve high attack success rate while having low detectability (attacks mimic natural errors) 
- Propose variational autoencoder method to rapidly create poisoned synthetic dataset
- Analyze attacks using spectral analysis and discuss countermeasures like adversarial training to improve robustness

Overall, this is one of the first papers to systematically demonstrate and analyze adversarial attacks on AI models in genomics. The findings reveal vulnerabilities in current models and aim to motivate further research into improving robustness of AI in critical genomics applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a black-box adversarial attack framework to evaluate the robustness of popular machine learning models on genomic data by modifying input features to reduce model accuracy and increase false positives/negatives, and shows that the attacks can mimic natural errors to evade detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a novel framework of attack and analysis for popular machine learning models in genomics, that utilizes a distinct approach to affect the final prediction of the model. All the methods proposed can be considered black-box and model-agnostic as they do not require access to the model gradient.

2. Studying the success rate of the attack at varying intensities and concluding the best possible attack settings. On the basis of the results, discussing countermeasures aimed at strengthening popular architectures. 

3. Supplementing the previous attack methods with a generative attack model capable of rapidly building poisoned synthetic datasets ready to be inserted into AI-powered genomics pipelines.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing a new black-box attack framework for genomic models, analyzing its effectiveness, and providing suggestions for countermeasures and defenses. Additionally, the paper demonstrates a generative method to create poisoned synthetic genomic data.

The paper introduces a black-box adversarial attack framework focused on evaluating and undermining the robustness of AI models used for genomics tasks. It utilizes feature importance to select key features to perturb and a VAE-based approach to generate poisoned data. The attacks are analyzed via spectral analysis and potential countermeasures are discussed.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel black-box attack method called FIMBA. What are the key advantages of using a black-box attack compared to a white-box attack in the context of attacking genomic models?

2. The FIMBA attack relies on using SHAP values to select the most important features to perturb. Explain how SHAP values are calculated and why targeting features with high SHAP values makes the attack more efficient. 

3. The interpolation step in the FIMBA attack gradually transforms samples between an original sample and a target false positive/negative sample. Explain why this interpolation approach helps make the attack samples less detectable compared to simply replacing feature values directly.

4. The paper experiments with both a main FIMBA attack approach and a brute force random attack approach. Compare and contrast these two approaches in terms of attack efficiency, effectiveness, and detectability. 

5. Explain the motivation behind analyzing the spectral properties (via FFT) of attacked datasets as a way to evaluate attack detectability. What specifically does a high structural similarity index (SSIM) between original and attacked datasets indicate?

6. The variational autoencoder (VAE) model is used in the paper to generate synthetic poisoned data. Explain how the VAE model works and what advantages it offers for creating adversarial genomics data. 

7. How might the complexity and topological properties of the original genomics dataset impact the success rate of adversarial attacks? Discuss factors that might make a model more or less vulnerable.  

8. The paper evaluates attacks on both a cancer genomics dataset (TCGA) and a COVID-19 dataset. Compare and contrast the relative effectiveness of attacks on these two datasets. What differences are observed?

9. Discuss some potential real-world implications if adversarial attacks similar to FIMBA were successfully deployed against genomic models used in clinical settings. What risks might be introduced?

10. The paper proposes some countermeasures to improve model robustness against FIMBA-style attacks. Discuss these countermeasures and how they might mitigate or prevent such attacks on deployed models. What additional defenses should be explored?
