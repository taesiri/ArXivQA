# [3DiFACE: Diffusion-based Speech-driven 3D Facial Animation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for speech-driven 3D facial animation learn a deterministic mapping from audio to facial motion, overlooking the inherent one-to-many relationship where a single audio signal can match multiple reasonable facial animations. This limits the diversity of synthesized animations. In addition, most methods focus only on motion synthesis but do not allow for motion editing capabilities like inserting new keyframes. However, motion editing is important for practical content creation applications.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a diffusion-based model for speech-driven facial animation that can generate diverse motions for the same audio input. The model is lightweight and can be trained on small datasets while still capturing person-specific motions and speaking styles. A key aspect is a fine-tuning step that adapts the model to a target person given only a short video, leading to personalized animations. In addition, the stochastic nature of the model allows editing applications like inserting new keyframes or interactively manipulating the motion.

Main Contributions:
- A lightweight diffusion-based model for speech-driven 3D facial animation that can generate diverse motions from the same audio input
- An efficient fine-tuning approach to capture person-specific motions and speaking styles from just a short target video
- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results on facial animation datasets
- Unique capability for applications like inserting new keyframes and motion editing while matching the person's style
- First model that combines personalized speech-driven facial animation with motion editing abilities for content creation

In summary, the paper introduces a novel diffusion framework to generate and edit diverse and personalized 3D facial animations from speech, outperforming previous deterministic state-of-the-art methods while enabling new editing capabilities critical for content creation.
