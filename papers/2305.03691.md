# [Mining bias-target Alignment from Voronoi Cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03691)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can we mitigate the impact of bias in deep neural networks in an unsupervised, bias-agnostic manner? 

The key hypothesis seems to be that by observing the relative distance of misclassified samples to the nearest Voronoi hyperplane of the correct target class, it is possible to identify when the model has learned bias-target alignment information. This information can then be used to train an unbiased model in two ways:

1) By reweighting the loss to give higher weight to bias-misaligned samples. This encourages learning the misclassified samples.

2) By minimizing the mutual information between predicted and true bias alignment on misaligned samples only. This removes bias-target alignment information from the bottleneck layer.

So in summary, the central research question is how to perform debiasing without knowing anything about the specific biases, using the relative Voronoi distances as a signal for when bias-target alignment has been learned. The two components of the method then leverage this to train an unbiased model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a bias-agnostic approach to mitigate the impact of bias in deep neural networks. The key ideas are:

- Using a metric to quantify "bias alignment/misalignment" on target classes by observing the relative distance of misclassified samples to the nearest Voronoi hyperplane of the correct target class. This helps identify when the model has learned biased correlations.

- Using the bias alignment information to discourage the propagation of bias-target alignment through the network. This is done in two ways:

1) Weighting the loss contribution of each sample to favor learning of misaligned samples over aligned ones. 

2) Minimizing the extractable bias alignment information at the bottleneck layer of the network conditioned on the bias-target misalignment.

- The approach does not require any prior bias labels or knowledge about the type of bias. Experiments on several datasets show it achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised debiasing methods even with multiple biases present.

In summary, the key contribution is a bias-agnostic technique to identify and mitigate learned biases by looking at relational information between misclassified examples and target class boundaries. This allows debiasing without needing explicit knowledge of the biases.
