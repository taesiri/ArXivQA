# [Mining bias-target Alignment from Voronoi Cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03691)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can we mitigate the impact of bias in deep neural networks in an unsupervised, bias-agnostic manner? 

The key hypothesis seems to be that by observing the relative distance of misclassified samples to the nearest Voronoi hyperplane of the correct target class, it is possible to identify when the model has learned bias-target alignment information. This information can then be used to train an unbiased model in two ways:

1) By reweighting the loss to give higher weight to bias-misaligned samples. This encourages learning the misclassified samples.

2) By minimizing the mutual information between predicted and true bias alignment on misaligned samples only. This removes bias-target alignment information from the bottleneck layer.

So in summary, the central research question is how to perform debiasing without knowing anything about the specific biases, using the relative Voronoi distances as a signal for when bias-target alignment has been learned. The two components of the method then leverage this to train an unbiased model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a bias-agnostic approach to mitigate the impact of bias in deep neural networks. The key ideas are:

- Using a metric to quantify "bias alignment/misalignment" on target classes by observing the relative distance of misclassified samples to the nearest Voronoi hyperplane of the correct target class. This helps identify when the model has learned biased correlations.

- Using the bias alignment information to discourage the propagation of bias-target alignment through the network. This is done in two ways:

1) Weighting the loss contribution of each sample to favor learning of misaligned samples over aligned ones. 

2) Minimizing the extractable bias alignment information at the bottleneck layer of the network conditioned on the bias-target misalignment.

- The approach does not require any prior bias labels or knowledge about the type of bias. Experiments on several datasets show it achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised debiasing methods even with multiple biases present.

In summary, the key contribution is a bias-agnostic technique to identify and mitigate learned biases by looking at relational information between misclassified examples and target class boundaries. This allows debiasing without needing explicit knowledge of the biases.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised debiasing method that identifies when a model learns spurious bias-target correlations by monitoring misclassified samples' distance to decision boundaries, then extracts this alignment and uses it to reweight the loss and remove bias information from the model's bottleneck.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of debiasing deep neural networks:

- This paper proposes a novel unsupervised and bias-agnostic approach to mitigating bias in deep neural networks. Unlike many existing debiasing methods, it does not require access to bias labels or prior knowledge about the specific types of bias present. This makes it more generally applicable in real-world scenarios where bias labels may be unavailable.

- The key idea is to identify when the model learns alignment between the bias and target classes by looking at the relative distance of misclassified samples to the nearest Voronoi cell boundary of the correct class. This allows it to extract bias-target alignment information without supervision.

- It leverages the extracted bias-target alignment in two ways: 1) re-weighting the loss to focus on misaligned examples, and 2) adding a term to minimize mutual information about bias alignment in the bottleneck layer representations. This two-pronged approach is innovative.

- The experiments compare the method to both supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art techniques on several benchmark debiasing datasets. The results are very competitive, achieving new SOTA for unsupervised methods in many cases. It even outperforms some supervised methods in certain experiments.

- The approach does have limitations in cases of extremely high bias-target correlation, where the lack of misaligned examples makes extraction difficult. But overall, it pushes the state-of-the-art for unsupervised debiasing and offers a promising direction.

- Compared to similar unsupervised methods like LfF, it avoids assumptions that bias is learned early and instead adapts to extract alignment information whenever it emerges. The use of Voronoi cells is also novel.

In summary, this paper makes excellent contributions to the field of debiasing by introducing a novel bias-agnostic approach that achieves impressive performance compared to existing methods. The analysis of bias-target alignment and strategies used for debiasing are innovative.
