# [MathVista: Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning of Foundation Models in   Visual Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02255)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question or hypothesis is:

How do foundation models like LLMs and LMMs perform on tasks that require mathematical reasoning within visual contexts?

The authors motivate the need for this research by pointing out that:

- Many existing math reasoning datasets focus solely on textual tasks, even though many math problems are grounded in visual information. 

- While there are some vision-language math datasets, they tend to focus on specific tasks or contexts. There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarking across diverse mathematical reasoning skills and visual contexts.

- LLMs and LMMs have shown impressive capabilities, but their skills specifically for mathematical reasoning with visual inputs have not been formally evaluated.

To address this gap, the authors introduce the MathVista benchmark spanning various mathematical reasoning types (arithmetic, algebraic, statistical etc), visual contexts (diagrams, charts, figures), and task formats (math word problems, textbook QA, figure QA). 

The key hypothesis seems to be that despite recent progress, LLMs and LMMs will show significant shortcomings compared to human performance when tested on MathVista. The authors aim to demonstrate these gaps through a rigorous set of experiments on prominent foundation models.

In summary, the central research question is assessing and quantifying the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs and LMMs in visual contexts using the diverse MathVista benchmark. The overarching hypothesis is that current models still have major deficiencies compared to human capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the introduction of MathVista, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of foundation models like LLMs and LMMs in visual contexts. 

Some key points about MathVista and its contribution:

- Currently, most math reasoning datasets for LLMs involve only textual tasks. However, many real-world math problems have an intrinsic visual component. MathVista helps bridge this gap by amalgamating challenges from diverse mathematical and visual QA datasets.

- The authors systematically built MathVista following a taxonomy of tasks, reasoning skills, and visual contexts. It comprises over 6000 examples sourced from 28 existing datasets and 3 new datasets introduced in this work.

- The benchmark features a diverse array of visual contexts beyond natural images, including geometry diagrams, figures, charts, and academic illustrations. The integrated reasoning challenges go beyond OCR or captioning, requiring deeper visual understanding and mathematical reasoning.

- Through comprehensive experiments on 11 LLMs, LMMs and augmented LLMs, the authors demonstrate these models still lag significantly behind human performance. The best model, Multimodal Bard, achieves only 58% of human accuracy.

- MathVista provides the community with a robust benchmark to facilitate future research on developing general AI systems proficient in mathematical reasoning grounded in real-world visual contexts.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of MathVista, a much-needed multimodal benchmark to systematically evaluate and advance foundation models' mathematical reasoning abilities within visual contexts.

 Based on my review, here is how I see this paper comparing to other research in the field:

- This paper presents a new dataset called MathVista for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of AI models in visual contexts. Other datasets in this space tend to focus purely on textual math problems or general visual reasoning without an emphasis on mathematical tasks. MathVista amalgamates diverse math and visual reasoning challenges, helping to advance research at the intersection of these domains.

- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of 11 prominent foundation models on MathVista, including LLMs, augmented LLMs, and LMMs. This large-scale evaluation sheds light on current capabilities and limitations. In contrast, most prior work concentrates on a smaller set of models. The paper also establishes strong human baselines.

- The authors propose novel techniques like using LLMs to extract answers from generated responses for evaluation. Other benchmarks often rely on more rigid matching rules or templates. This methodology could enable more flexible assessments.

- The paper identifies salient modes of failure through qualitative analysis, like visual or textual hallucinations. Many existing studies focus only on aggregate metrics rather than these fine-grained insights.

- MathVista incorporates diverse reasoning skills, visual contexts, and grade levels. Many benchmarks concentrate narrowly on specific tasks or domains. The diversity and coverage make MathVista more holistic.

- Through MathVista, the paper reveals substantial gaps even for top models like Bard, underscoring the need for advances in visual perception, reasoning, and grounding. Other works showcase strengths of LLMs and LMMs but lack difficult benchmarks to expose limitations.

Overall, I believe this paper makes significant contributions to methodology, analysis, insights, and the introduction of a more diverse, challenging benchmark compared to related work. The robust evaluation and findings help advance research towards achieving rigorous mathematical reasoning within visual contexts.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new model called MathVista for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) in visual contexts. MathVista consists of over 6,000 examples sourced from 28 existing datasets as well as 3 new datasets created by the authors to address missing types of reasoning skills and visual contexts. The examples involve tasks like math word problems, geometry problem solving, textbook question answering, and figure question answering, and are annotated with metadata about the reasoning skills needed. To evaluate models, the authors first generate free-form textual responses to the questions using various LLM and LMM models. They then extract the final short answers from the free-form responses using an LLM-based answer extractor. The extracted answers are compared to the ground truth answers to compute accuracy metrics. Experiments on 11 models, including LLMs like GPT-4 and LMMs like Multimodal Bard, reveal significant gaps compared to human performance, indicating ample room for improvement in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts. The paper aims to facilitate future research on developing general AI assistants proficient in this challenging skill.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?
