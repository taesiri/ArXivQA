# [MathVista: Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning of Foundation Models in   Visual Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02255)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the central research question or hypothesis is:How do foundation models like LLMs and LMMs perform on tasks that require mathematical reasoning within visual contexts?The authors motivate the need for this research by pointing out that:- Many existing math reasoning datasets focus solely on textual tasks, even though many math problems are grounded in visual information. - While there are some vision-language math datasets, they tend to focus on specific tasks or contexts. There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarking across diverse mathematical reasoning skills and visual contexts.- LLMs and LMMs have shown impressive capabilities, but their skills specifically for mathematical reasoning with visual inputs have not been formally evaluated.To address this gap, the authors introduce the MathVista benchmark spanning various mathematical reasoning types (arithmetic, algebraic, statistical etc), visual contexts (diagrams, charts, figures), and task formats (math word problems, textbook QA, figure QA). The key hypothesis seems to be that despite recent progress, LLMs and LMMs will show significant shortcomings compared to human performance when tested on MathVista. The authors aim to demonstrate these gaps through a rigorous set of experiments on prominent foundation models.In summary, the central research question is assessing and quantifying the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs and LMMs in visual contexts using the diverse MathVista benchmark. The overarching hypothesis is that current models still have major deficiencies compared to human capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the introduction of MathVista, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of foundation models like LLMs and LMMs in visual contexts. Some key points about MathVista and its contribution:- Currently, most math reasoning datasets for LLMs involve only textual tasks. However, many real-world math problems have an intrinsic visual component. MathVista helps bridge this gap by amalgamating challenges from diverse mathematical and visual QA datasets.- The authors systematically built MathVista following a taxonomy of tasks, reasoning skills, and visual contexts. It comprises over 6000 examples sourced from 28 existing datasets and 3 new datasets introduced in this work.- The benchmark features a diverse array of visual contexts beyond natural images, including geometry diagrams, figures, charts, and academic illustrations. The integrated reasoning challenges go beyond OCR or captioning, requiring deeper visual understanding and mathematical reasoning.- Through comprehensive experiments on 11 LLMs, LMMs and augmented LLMs, the authors demonstrate these models still lag significantly behind human performance. The best model, Multimodal Bard, achieves only 58% of human accuracy.- MathVista provides the community with a robust benchmark to facilitate future research on developing general AI systems proficient in mathematical reasoning grounded in real-world visual contexts.In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of MathVista, a much-needed multimodal benchmark to systematically evaluate and advance foundation models' mathematical reasoning abilities within visual contexts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the key points in the paper:The paper introduces MathVista, a new benchmark for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of foundation models like LLMs and LMMs in visual contexts, finding that even top models lag significantly behind human performance, indicating substantial room for improvement.
