# [Nearly Optimal Approximation Rates for Deep Super ReLU Networks on   Sobolev Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activation functions are unable to accurately approximate functions in Sobolev spaces measured by Sobolev norms (e.g. $W^{m,p}$ for $m\ge2$). This is needed for tasks like solving PDEs with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
- Using smooth activation functions like sigmoid suffers from vanishing gradients and complex composition formulas. Prior work using both ReLU and its square helps but has not fully resolved optimal approximation rates and network architecture.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce deep super ReLU networks (DSRNs) that use ReLU activations in most layers, with the square of ReLU only in the last $\sim\log_2 L$ layers where $L$ is network depth. This retains ReLU advantages while smoothing at the end.

Main Contributions:
- Prove DSRNs can effectively approximate functions in Sobolev spaces with nearly optimal rate w.r.t network width $N$ and depth $L$. Enabled by estimating the VC dimension of higher order derivatives of DSRNs.
- Bound generalization error in Sobolev spaces using estimate of pseudo-dimension of higher order derivatives.
- DSRN architecture eases training vs fully quadratic networks, with smoothness only at the end.
- Numerical experiments validate DSRNs can solve PDEs, approximating smooth solutions.

In summary, the paper introduces DSRNs that strategically use ReLU and its square to achieve near optimal approximation and generalization guarantees for learning in Sobolev function spaces, with an architecture amenable for effective training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a deep neural network architecture called deep super ReLU networks (DSRNs) that uses predominantly ReLU activations with a few layers of squared ReLU at the end to effectively approximate functions in Sobolev spaces, proves the optimality of this approximation, and bounds the generalization error.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces deep super ReLU networks (DSRNs) to approximate functions in Sobolev spaces measured by Sobolev norms. DSRNs use mostly ReLU activations, with only a few layers using the square of ReLU at the end, to retain the benefits of ReLU while smoothing the networks.

2. It proves the optimality of the approximation rates achieved by DSRNs by estimating the VC dimension of higher order derivatives of the networks. 

3. It provides an upper bound on the pseudo-dimension of higher order derivatives of DSRNs and uses this to obtain a generalization error bound for the networks in Sobolev spaces.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel neural network architecture that can effectively approximate functions in Sobolev spaces, proves the optimality of the approximation rates, and analyzes the generalization capability. The combination of ReLU and its square in the architecture balances performance and ease of training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Deep super ReLU networks (DSRNs): The novel neural network architecture proposed in the paper that uses mostly ReLU activations but adds layers with squared ReLU at the end to smooth the network output.

- Sobolev spaces: The function spaces, denoted $W^{m,p}$, that the DSRNs are designed to approximate, measured by Sobolev norms.

- VC dimension: A measure of the complexity or expressiveness of a function class that is used to analyze the approximation optimality of DSRNs. The paper provides VC dimension bounds for higher order derivatives of DSRNs. 

- Pseudo-dimension: A related measure to VC dimension that is used to bound the generalization error of DSRNs approximating functions in Sobolev spaces. The paper gives pseudo-dimension bounds for higher order derivatives.

- Optimality: The paper proves near optimal approximation rates for DSRNs approximating Sobolev functions, as measured by network width and depth. This optimality is shown using the VC dimension analysis.

- Generalization error: The difference between a network's training error and test error. The paper's pseudo-dimension analysis allows bounding this quantity for DSRNs learning in Sobolev spaces.

In summary, the key ideas have to do with the DSRN architecture, approximation theory and generalization guarantees for this architecture in Sobolev spaces based on VC/pseudo-dimension analyses.
