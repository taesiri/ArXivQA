# [Team-related Features in Code Review Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06244)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes and evaluates the use of three novel sets of team-related features—code ownership, developer workload, and team relationship—to improve predictions that are helpful for building code reviewer recommenders. Specifically, the goal is to predict which developers will participate in a code review and how much feedback they will provide. An empirical study is conducted on a proprietary dataset from a company to assess the value of these feature sets. The results indicate that code ownership features, which capture developers' experience with the files and modules changed in the code review, have the best individual predictive power. However, a combination of all the proposed features together with lines of changed code leads to the optimal performance. Moreover, the study explores the impact of using different past timeframes of data for training the models. It finds that periods as short as 3 months provide comparable results to longer histories, enabling models to be retrained frequently without significant data needs. Overall, this work demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating team structure and relationships into recommendations and provides insights to guide the development of effective reviewer recommendation systems.
