# [Team-related Features in Code Review Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06244)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes and evaluates the use of three novel sets of team-related features—code ownership, developer workload, and team relationship—to improve predictions that are helpful for building code reviewer recommenders. Specifically, the goal is to predict which developers will participate in a code review and how much feedback they will provide. An empirical study is conducted on a proprietary dataset from a company to assess the value of these feature sets. The results indicate that code ownership features, which capture developers' experience with the files and modules changed in the code review, have the best individual predictive power. However, a combination of all the proposed features together with lines of changed code leads to the optimal performance. Moreover, the study explores the impact of using different past timeframes of data for training the models. It finds that periods as short as 3 months provide comparable results to longer histories, enabling models to be retrained frequently without significant data needs. Overall, this work demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating team structure and relationships into recommendations and provides insights to guide the development of effective reviewer recommendation systems.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Modern code review (MCR) relies on developers reviewing code changes and providing feedback before changes are merged. Finding suitable reviewers is critical for the effectiveness of MCR, but can be challenging, especially in large projects. Most existing automated reviewer recommendation techniques focus solely on technical aspects like code familiarity and ignore non-technical factors like team structure and relationships. 

Solution:
This paper proposes using three novel sets of features related to (1) code ownership, (2) developer workload, and (3) team relationships to improve automated prediction of reviewer participation and amount of feedback. Specifically:

- Code ownership features capture developers' experience with the changed files/modules as authors and reviewers. This also includes whether they are maintainer of the changed module.

- Workload features quantify developers' current reviewing and authoring activities to estimate availability.

- Team relationship features encode whether developers are on the same team, location, and their past interactions with the author's team.

These features are used to train machine learning models to predict whether developers will participate in a review (classification) and how much feedback they will provide (regression).

Contributions:

- Introduction and evaluation of new non-technical team-based features for reviewer recommendation in MCR

- Detailed investigation of feature importance and selection for predicting reviewer participation and feedback amount

- Analysis of impact of different time windows of training data, finding that short 3-month windows provide good performance  

- Guidelines for configuring reviewer recommendation systems to balance precision and recall or optimize for specific objectives

The results provide new insights into relevant factors for reviewer selection in industrial projects with structured teams. The proposed features could significantly improve existing recommendation techniques. The analysis also informs configuration decisions to tailor systems to project needs.
