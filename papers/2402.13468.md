# [STENCIL: Submodular Mutual Information Based Weak Supervision for   Cold-Start Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13468)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Active learning methods aim to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most useful unlabeled instances for labeling. However, most methods struggle in class-imbalanced and cold-start (no initial labeled data) scenarios. 
- Specifically, common active learning strategies fail to improve the performance on rare/minority classes in such settings, especially within the first round of selection.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes STENCIL, a method that utilizes weak supervision to guide the first round of active learning selection. 
- A small set of exemplar phrases representing the rare class is provided by a human expert based on prior knowledge of the task. 
- STENCIL then selects instances from the unlabeled data that maximize the Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) with this exemplar set. 
- By definition, SMI aims to retrieve a diverse yet query-relevant subset. The selected instances are assumed to be weakly labeled as the rare class and are given to an oracle for strong labeling.

Main Contributions:
- STENCIL provides a complimentary strategy specialized for the cold-start round of active learning in class-imbalanced scenarios.
- Experiments on text classification tasks show improvements of 10-24% in accuracy and 17-40% in rare-class F1 over common active learning methods using just a single round of selection.
- STENCIL is robust to the choice of SMI function and performs well even with very small exemplar sets (as few as 15 phrases).
- The ability to leverage prior knowledge via weak supervision makes STENCIL well-suited for NLP fine-tuning applications where reasonable query exemplars can be provided.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel method to address class imbalance during the critical cold-start phase of active learning by utilizing weak supervision. Experiments demonstrate clear benefits on text classification tasks.
