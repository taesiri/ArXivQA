# [Survey on Factuality in Large Language Models: Knowledge, Retrieval and   Domain-Specificity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07521)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop methods to evaluate and enhance the factuality of large language models?

Specifically, the paper provides a comprehensive survey of research related to the factuality of large language models (LLMs). It delves into:

- Defining the factuality issue in LLMs and analyzing its impact (Section 2)

- Techniques for evaluating factuality in LLMs, including benchmarks, metrics, and studies (Section 3) 

- Analyzing the underlying mechanisms and causes of factual errors in LLMs (Section 4)

- Approaches to enhance factuality in LLMs, for both standalone LLMs and retrieval-augmented LLMs (Section 5)

The overall goal is to offer a structured overview of the critical issue of factuality in LLMs, shedding light on how to assess factuality through quantitative evaluation and also improve factuality via various enhancement strategies. The central research question is focused on developing methodologies to effectively evaluate and enhance the factuality of LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. It provides a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of research related to factuality in large language models (LLMs). The paper categorizes this research into four key dimensions: 

- The definition and impact of the factuality issue.

- Techniques for evaluating factuality and quantitatively assessing it. 

- Analyzing the underlying mechanisms of factuality in LLMs and identifying root causes of factual errors.

- Approaches to enhance the factuality of LLMs.

2. The paper offers a structured analysis of the factuality problem in LLMs, covering both models without external knowledge retrieval (e.g. ChatGPT) and retrieval-augmented LLMs (e.g. Bing Chat). 

3. It provides an in-depth examination of research related to evaluating factuality in LLMs, including benchmarks, metrics, studies, and domain-specific evaluations.

4. The paper delves into the intrinsic mechanisms influencing factuality in LLMs, analyzing aspects like knowledge storage, completeness, conflicts, and causes of errors.

5. It discusses and categorizes the wide range of techniques proposed to improve factuality in LLMs, ranging from pretrained and supervised finetuning strategies to retrieval methods and decoding innovations.

In summary, this paper offers a holistic overview of the landscape of factuality in large language models, synthesizing and structuring the extensive research in this area into an accessible reference for researchers and developers. The comprehensive taxonomy and analysis make it a valuable guide to understanding and improving factuality in LLMs.
