# [Monolingual or Multilingual Instruction Tuning: Which Makes a Better   Alpaca](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08958)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: What are cost-efficient approaches and best practices for adapting large language models (LLMs) to a multilingual chat environment through monolingual and multilingual instruction tuning? 

Specifically, the authors aim to empirically analyze and compare the efficacy of different methods for instruction tuning LLMs on monolingual and multilingual data in order to expand their capabilities for open-ended question answering across languages. The key hypotheses tested are:

1) Multilingual instruction tuning may not be crucial for an LLM's performance in a single language like English, but can improve robustness in responding to multiple languages.

2) With a fixed computational budget, training an LLM on downsampled multilingual data can perform on par with separate monolingual tuning per language. 

3) The optimal approach differs for full-parameter fine-tuning vs low-rank adaptation, with the former favoring monolingual and the latter favoring multilingual tuning.

4) Tuning on a mix of languages seen during training may overfit and hurt performance on unseen languages, so budgets may be better spent on less data.

Through controlled experiments tuning LLMs of varying sizes and languages, the paper provides practical insights and guidance around trade-offs between language specialization and versatility when expanding LLMs to new languages under budget constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an empirical analysis comparing monolingual and multilingual instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) under constrained budgets. The key findings are:

- Multilingual instruction tuning works well with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), while monolingual tuning is better for full-parameter fine-tuning. 

- When resources are limited, training on downsampled multilingual data gives more robust performance across languages than monolingual tuning. This suggests machine translation can create inexpensive multilingual datasets.

- Models tuned only on English data lack robustness in responding consistently in the query language. Multilingual tuning enhances language consistency.

- For unseen test languages, downsampled multilingual tuning generalizes better than using the full mixed dataset.

Overall, the controlled experiments provide practical insights into expanding language capabilities of LLMs via monolingual or multilingual instruction tuning under budget constraints. The results serve as useful guidelines for model developers and users.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper explores the efficacy of monolingual and multilingual instruction tuning for large language models (LLMs) on their open-ended question answering ability and language versatility. The key finding is that with limited resources, multilingual instruction tuning on downsampled machine-translated data delivers robust language support and is preferable to separate monolingual tuning per language.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores monolingual versus multilingual instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) with the goal of understanding cost-efficient approaches to adapting LLMs to multilingual chat environments. The authors employ the Alpaca dataset and machine translations of it in 8 languages to conduct controlled comparisons of monolingual and multilingual instruction tuning. Both full-parameter fine-tuning and low-rank adaptation methods are analyzed. The results reveal that multilingual tuning works well with low-rank adaptation but monolingual tuning is better for full-parameter fine-tuning.

Further experiments on unseen languages and different LLM families confirm these findings. Overall, the paper provides practical insights into leveraging machine translation for expanding language capabilities of LLMs via instruction tuning in a computationally efficient manner.

In summary, this paper explores monolingual versus multilingual instruction tuning of LLMs using the Alpaca dataset and its translations. The main findings are that multilingual tuning excels with low-rank adaptation but monolingual tuning is better for full fine-tuning.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper explores monolingual and multilingual instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) to develop open-ended question answering capability. The main method involves using the Alpaca dataset of instruction-response pairs in English, translating it into 8 other languages, and using these datasets to fine-tune LLMs in different conditions. The controlled settings compare monolingual tuning per language, multilingual tuning on all data mixed, and two budget-constrained options: using only English data for all languages, and training on downsampled multilingual data. The LLMs are evaluated on test sets in seen and unseen languages. The results reveal insights like: multilingual tuning works better for parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, while monolingual tuning is better for full fine-tuning; and with limited budget, training on downsampled multilingual data is more robust than using English-only data. Overall, the paper provides practical guidance on choosing data recipes for monolingual or multilingual instruction tuning under computational constraints.
