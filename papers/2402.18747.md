# [Fine-Tuned Machine Translation Metrics Struggle in Unseen Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuned machine translation (MT) metrics like Comet have become very popular recently as they correlate better with human judgments compared to surface-form metrics like BLEU. 
- However, these fine-tuned metrics are typically trained on MT quality judgments from domains like news and conversations seen in WMT shared tasks. This raises the question - are these metrics truly robust to unseen domains, or is their strong performance partly attributed to the domain match between training and test data?

Proposed Solution:
- The authors collected a new biomedical (Bio) MQM dataset covering 11 language pairs and 25k judgments. Analysis showed Bio domain is quite distinct from WMT domains.  
- They evaluated different classes of metrics on Bio vs WMT and found fine-tuned metrics like Comet had much lower correlation on Bio while surface-form metrics did better on Bio. This indicates fine-tuned metrics struggle with domain shifts.

Key Contributions:
- Release new extensive Bio MQM dataset for 11 language pairs along with high quality reference translations
- Show clear domain robustness issues with fine-tuned MT metrics via controlled comparison on distinct domains
- Detailed analysis to show domain gap persists throughout various stages of fine-tuning and is not simply an artifact of deficiencies in pretrained models

Overall, this paper clearly highlights and empirically demonstrates the lack of out-of-domain generalization for current fine-tuned MT metrics. It suggests the need for more diversity in human judgments used to train these metrics as well as techniques to improve their robustness across domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new biomedical domain MQM dataset to investigate whether machine translation metrics fine-tuned on human judgments struggle to generalize to unseen domains, finding that while fine-tuned metrics perform worse on the new domain, surface-form and pre-trained metrics actually improve.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) Introducing a new, extensive MQM-annotated dataset covering 11 language pairs in the biomedical domain. This helps address the lack of diversity in existing MQM datasets.

2) Using this new dataset to investigate whether machine translation metrics that are fine-tuned on human judgments are robust to domain shifts between training and inference. 

3) Finding that fine-tuned metrics like Comet struggle with the domain mismatch between training data (from news/WMT domains) and test data (biomedical), while surface-form metrics and metrics based on algorithms/prompting do not exhibit as large of a performance drop.

4) Presenting analysis showing the domain gap persists throughout different stages of fine-tuning and is not simply due to deficiencies in the pre-trained model. 

In summary, the key contribution is using a new biomedical MQM dataset to analyze domain robustness of different types of MT metrics, and showing issues with fine-tuned metrics in handling unseen domains.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Machine translation (MT) metrics
- Fine-tuned metrics (Comet, Bleurt, UniTE)

- Pre-trained metrics (BERTScore, Prism)
- Prompt-based metrics (GEMBA, AutoMQM)
- Domain robustness/generalization
- Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM)
- Biomedical domain
- Unseen domains
- Catastrophic forgetting
- Domain adaptation 

The paper introduces a new biomedical MQM dataset and uses it to evaluate different types of MT metrics, focusing on the domain robustness of fine-tuned metrics. It finds that fine-tuned metrics struggle with the unseen biomedical domain, while surface-form and pre-trained metrics generalize better. Analysis is provided on the various stages of fine-tuning to investigate why the performance gap occurs.
