# [An Efficient Solution to the 2D Visibility Problem in Cartesian Grid   Maps and its Application in Heuristic Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06494)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating visibility (i.e. existence of line-of-sight) across grid maps is important for many robotics applications like path planning, but current methods like ray casting are inefficient as they scale with number of grid cells. 
- Formal methods to compute visibility polygons for grid maps are lacking. Existing techniques are limited to polygonal environments.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate visibility as a transportable quantity that satisfies a linear first-order hyperbolic PDE. 
- Transport visibility outwards from source using a numerically stable upwind scheme that converges to true visibility polygon.
- Algorithm updates each grid cell just once based on visibility of neighbor cells. Compute complexity is O(n) where n is number of grid cells.
- Extendable to evaluate existence of curve-of-sights and visibility in 3D grids.

Key Contributions:
- Novel method to compute visibility polygon and curvilinear polygon for grid maps efficiently in a single pass. 10 arithmetic operations per cell.
- Scales linearly with number of grid cells unlike other methods. 100x faster than ray casting.
- Introduce visibility quantity as heuristic for deterministic, local minima-free path planning on grids. Places points barely visible to parent.
- Provide algorithms, results and open source code for visibility computation and path planning using visibility heuristic.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient novel method to quantify visibility across grid maps by formulating and transporting it as a first-order PDE. This enables applications like fast, optimal path planning by using visibility as a heuristic.
