# [An Efficient Solution to the 2D Visibility Problem in Cartesian Grid   Maps and its Application in Heuristic Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06494)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating visibility (i.e. existence of line-of-sight) across grid maps is important for many robotics applications like path planning, but current methods like ray casting are inefficient as they scale with number of grid cells. 
- Formal methods to compute visibility polygons for grid maps are lacking. Existing techniques are limited to polygonal environments.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate visibility as a transportable quantity that satisfies a linear first-order hyperbolic PDE. 
- Transport visibility outwards from source using a numerically stable upwind scheme that converges to true visibility polygon.
- Algorithm updates each grid cell just once based on visibility of neighbor cells. Compute complexity is O(n) where n is number of grid cells.
- Extendable to evaluate existence of curve-of-sights and visibility in 3D grids.

Key Contributions:
- Novel method to compute visibility polygon and curvilinear polygon for grid maps efficiently in a single pass. 10 arithmetic operations per cell.
- Scales linearly with number of grid cells unlike other methods. 100x faster than ray casting.
- Introduce visibility quantity as heuristic for deterministic, local minima-free path planning on grids. Places points barely visible to parent.
- Provide algorithms, results and open source code for visibility computation and path planning using visibility heuristic.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient novel method to quantify visibility across grid maps by formulating and transporting it as a first-order PDE. This enables applications like fast, optimal path planning by using visibility as a heuristic.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel, efficient method to compute visibility polygons and curvilinear polygons in grid maps by modeling visibility as a transportable quantity and solving a linear hyperbolic partial differential equation, and applies it to path planning using visibility as a heuristic.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. Posing visibility as a transportable quantity and transporting it using a stable and converging solution to a linear first-order hyperbolic PDE. This allows efficient computation of the visibility grid map and the curvilinear polygon for single or multiple light sources.

2. Introducing the visibility quantity as a heuristic for any-angle path planning in grid maps. This results in a greedy path planner that drives towards the target while avoiding local minima.

3. Providing algorithms, numerical experimental results, and an open-source implementation of the proposed visibility algorithm and path planner.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel, efficient method to compute visibility in grid maps, and demonstrates its usefulness by applying it to path planning as a heuristic. The efficiency, flexibility and applicability of the proposed ideas are highlighted as the main contributions.
