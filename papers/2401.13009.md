# [Comparative Study of Causal Discovery Methods for Cyclic Models with   Hidden Confounders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Causal discovery algorithms aim to determine the causal relationships and mechanisms in complex systems. Most techniques presume the system has no feedback loops (is acyclic) and has no unmeasured variables (is causally sufficient). However, many real-world systems violate these assumptions.
- There is a need for causal discovery methods that can handle cycles and hidden confounders, but few algorithms exist. It is also unclear how these algorithms compare in terms of performance.

Methods Studied:
- The paper evaluates four causal discovery algorithms:
    - LLC-NF: Method of moments estimator 
    - LLC-F: LLC-NF combined with constraint-based methods 
    - ASP-d: Optimization method using answer set programming
    - ASP-s: Variant of ASP-d using a different separation criterion
- The methods are evaluated on simulated sparse linear models with cycles and confounders. The performance is measured using accuracy and AUC ROC metrics.

Results:
- More and diverse interventions lead to better discovery performance for all methods.
- ASP methods outperform LLC methods given fewer interventions, but with enough interventions satisfying theoretical requirements, LLC can beat ASP.
- There is little performance difference between ASP-d and ASP-s despite the presence of cycles.
- LLC-F outperforms LLC-NF for small datasets but this reverses for larger datasets.

Conclusions:
- All four methods show good discovery capabilities given sufficient interventions.  
- ASP methods seem preferable for situations with fewer experiments.
- Theoretical conditions on interventions are important for good performance.
- There is promise in combining constraint-based and method of moments approaches.

Main Contributions:
- First comparative evaluation of causal discovery methods allowing for cycles and confounders
- Demonstration of the utility of interventions and investigation of how performance depends on the intervention scheme
- Evidence that ASP-s could be universally applied, even for nearly linear systems
- Revealing that combining constraint-based methods with LLC can improve performance

The paper provides valuable practical guidance and theoretical insights on applying advanced causal discovery methods to real-world cyclic systems with hidden confounders.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comparative study of four causal discovery methods - two variants of the LLC algorithm and two variants of an ASP-based algorithm - evaluating their performance in detecting edges and confounders on simulated data from sparse linear cyclic structural causal models with hidden confounders and multiple interventional setups.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be a comprehensive comparative study evaluating and analyzing the performance of four causal discovery algorithms - LLC-NF, LLC-F, ASP-d, and ASP-s - on synthetic datasets from sparse linear structural causal models with cycles and hidden confounders. Specifically:

- The paper provides a systematic evaluation of these four algorithms across different interventional setups and dataset sizes, using metrics like accuracy and AUC ROC. 

- It studies how factors like the number/type of interventions and sample size impact the discovery capabilities of these algorithms.

- It compares constraint-based techniques like ASP to methods of moments estimators like LLC on this challenging setting of cyclic models with confounders. 

- It analyzes the relative strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms and provides guidance on when certain techniques might be preferred over others.

- Overall, the comprehensive simulation study and benchmarking of causal discovery methods on cyclic and causally insufficient models seems to be the key contribution. The paper helps better understand the practical applicability and limits of these modern techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the understanding of causal discovery algorithms by providing an extensive empirical evaluation focused on cyclic linear models with latent confounders.

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords that seem most relevant:

- Causal discovery

The paper focuses on comparing causal discovery methods (LLC, ASP-d, ASP-s) that can handle cyclic linear structural causal models with hidden confounders. It evaluates their performance using different experimental setups and dataset sizes. The key metrics are accuracy and AUC ROC. The methods rely on concepts like interventions, conditional independences, faithfulness of probability distributions, etc. Overall, the central theme seems to be causal discovery for cyclic linear models with hidden confounders, and comparative evaluation of algorithms like LLC, ASP-d and ASP-s in that context.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper states that the LLC method requires the SCM to be "weakly stable", meaning the matrix (I - UkB) must be invertible for all experiments k. What are the implications of this condition not being satisfied? How would it impact the accuracy of LLC?

2. In the description of the LLC-F algorithm, 4 different methods are used to extract additional linear equations from conditional independences. Can you explain in more detail how each of these 4 methods work and provide an illustrative example for one of them? 

3. The ASP optimization problem minimizes a loss function based on weights assigned to each conditional (in)dependence relation. The paper states the weights are obtained from p-values of hypothesis tests. What would be the impact of using different schemes for assigning the weights on the accuracy of ASP?

4. The paper combines ASP with a weak classifier to deal with cases where ASP returns an undetermined result. What would be alternative approaches to deal with undetermined results? How could the accuracy be further improved in these cases?

5. For the infinite sample size scenario, the paper uses a simplified approach for ASP instead of letting sample size go to infinity. What would be the expected behavior of ASP in the true infinite sample size case? Would you expect an increase in accuracy?

6. The SCMs used in the evaluations have only 5 nodes and 2 confounders. How do you expect the relative performance of the methods to change for larger graphs? Would some methods scale better than others?

7. The paper observes a switching effect between LLC-F and LLC-NF within groups in Figures 2 and 3. What could be potential reasons behind this switching effect? Is there something inherent about the methods causing this?

8. How sensitive are the accuracy results to the choice of hyperparameters like regularization parameters and significance levels? What would happen if suboptimal values are chosen? 

9. The evaluation relies on simulated data. What are limitations of evaluations based only on simulated data? Do you expect qualitative differences on real-world data?

10. The paper focuses on linear SCMs. How would the relative performances of the methods change if applied to nonlinear SCMs? Would some methods fail completely or degrade sharply in accuracy?
