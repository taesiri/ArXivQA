# [Detection of Unobserved Common Causes based on NML Code in Discrete,   Mixed, and Continuous Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper deals with the problem of causal discovery between two variables in the presence of unobserved common causes (latent confounders). Identifying causal relationships from observational data alone is challenging, and standard methods assume there are no unobserved common causes. However, this assumption is often violated in practice, leading to unreliable results. The paper revisits Reichenbach's common cause principle, which states that if two variables X and Y are statistically dependent, there exists a third variable C that causally influences both. The goal is to infer whether X causes Y, Y causes X, they are independent, or there is a latent confounder C, solely from the joint observational distribution P(X,Y). This is referred to as the Reichenbach problem. 

Existing Approaches & Limitations:
The paper reviews two main approaches to this problem - methods based on identifiable models and those based on algorithmic independence. However, these methods rely on assumptions about the functional form or distribution of the latent variable C. It is difficult to determine these properties of an unobserved variable beforehand. Thus, the applicability of these methods is limited.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes CLOUD, a method that solves the Reichenbach problem without making assumptions on the latent confounder C. It employs the minimum description length (MDL) principle to select the best causal model out of four candidates: X->Y, X<-Y, X _|_ Y, or X<-C->Y. For each model, the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) codelength of the data is computed. By explicitly allowing a fully expressive latent confounded model, CLOUD avoids constraints on C. The key insight is that while the confounded model always yields highest likelihood, computing codelengths accounts for model complexity as well and enables comparison.

Main Contributions:
- First method that detects latent confounding without assumptions, for discrete and continuous data
- Theoretical analysis proving consistency of CLOUD in terms of model selection
- Extensive experiments on synthetic data showing accuracy and robustness across data types and complex generative processes
- Strong performance on real-world benchmark datasets in identifying causal direction and presence of confounders

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in advancing reliable causal discovery through a practical method that does not rely on unverifiable assumptions. By employing sound information-theoretic principles, CLOUD pushes the capability of causal learning algorithms to handle real-world scenarios involving latent confounding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper extends a causal discovery method called CLOUD, which can detect causal relationships and the presence of latent confounders between two variables across discrete, mixed and continuous data types, to make it applicable to more data types while maintaining theoretical guarantees on consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a causal discovery method called CLOUD to detect causal relationships between two variables, including the presence of unobserved common causes, across discrete, mixed and continuous data types. Specifically:

- CLOUD formulates causal models representing four possible causal relationships based on Reichenbach's common cause principle, without making assumptions about the unobserved common causes.

- It employs the minimum description length (MDL) principle and selects the model that yields the minimum normalized maximum likelihood (NML) codelength to identify the underlying causal relationship. 

- The method is extended from only discrete data in previous work to accommodate mixed and continuous data types through discretization.

- Consistency of CLOUD is theoretically proven, and its high performance is demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

- A key advantage of CLOUD is it does not rely on explicit assumptions about the unobserved confounding variables, making it more widely applicable to solve the problem of detecting causality in the presence of latent common causes across different data types.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating an effective causal discovery method using MDL that can handle unobserved confounders and different data types.

It aims to detect causal relationships, including the presence of unobserved common causes, between two variables based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and using the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) codelength.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper extends the previous CLOUD method to handle continuous and mixed data types. What modifications were made to enable this, and what theoretical results ensure the method's consistency?

2. How does the use of two-stage coding with discretization allow the method to be applied to continuous data? What is the intuition behind this approach? 

3. What assumptions does CLOUD make about the functional form relating variables in the additive noise models? How could these assumptions be relaxed in future work?

4. The confounded model in CLOUD allows representing any joint distribution without assumptions on the latent variable. What is the intuition behind why this does not always lead to that model being selected?  

5. What challenges remain in applying CLOUD, as evidenced by its performance on zero-inflated data in the experiments? How might the method be made more robust?

6. The paper shows theoretically that CLOUD exhibits statistical consistency. What does this mean, and why is it an important property for causal discovery methods?

7. How exactly does CLOUD avoid making explicit assumptions on the form of latent confounders? What limitations does this impose?

8. The experiments on real-world data involve complex unknown data generating processes. Why do the results suggest CLOUD is reliable for such scenarios?

9. What modifications would be required to extend CLOUD to settings with more than two observed variables like latent causal networks? What issues may arise?

10. Using Normalized Maximum Likelihood enables model selection across varying complexities. However, this code is not always tractable to compute. What approximations could be made to improve computational efficiency?
