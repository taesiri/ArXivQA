# [Viewset Diffusion: (0-)Image-Conditioned 3D Generative Models from 2D   Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07881)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we learn a generative model for 3D objects that supports both conditional and unconditional generation, using only 2D multi-view supervision during training?

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach to:

1) Learn a generative model over 3D objects by modelling and generating "viewsets" (collections of 2D views) instead of 3D models directly. This allows using only 2D training data.

2) Design the model such that the mapping between viewsets and 3D models is integrated into the generative model itself. This allows generating 3D consistent outputs while still training on 2D data. 

3) Support both single-view 3D reconstruction (conditional generation given an input view) as well as unconditional 3D generation within the same model framework.

4) Model ambiguities inherent in single-view 3D reconstruction by generating multiple plausible solutions.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that modelling and generating viewsets can act as a proxy for generating 3D models, even with only 2D supervision, and that this can be integrated into a single generative model for both conditional and unconditional generation. The paper proposes a novel method called Viewset Diffusion to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The idea of generating viewsets (collections of 2D views of an object) as a way to apply denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to 3D object generation when only multi-view 2D supervision is available. 

2. An ambiguity-aware 3D reconstruction model that can sample different plausible reconstructions given a single input image. This model doubles as an unconditional 3D generator.

3. A network architecture that enables the model's reconstructions to match conditioning images, aggregate information from multiple views in an occlusion-aware manner, and estimate plausible 3D geometries.

4. A new synthetic benchmark dataset for evaluating single-image reconstruction techniques in ambiguous settings.

In summary, the key ideas are using viewsets to enable DDPM-based 3D generation from 2D data, modeling reconstruction ambiguity via sampling, and designing a suitable network architecture to aggregate information across views and predict 3D geometry. The contributions center around enabling probabilistic and ambiguity-aware 3D modeling and generation using only multi-view 2D supervision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a method called Viewset Diffusion to learn 3D generative models of objects from only 2D multi-view supervision. The key idea is to generate sets of 2D views (viewsets) of 3D objects using a diffusion model, while reconstructing the underlying 3D structure within the diffusion model's neural network. This allows training on 2D data while still producing 3D objects. The method supports conditional generation from 0 or more input views, enabling probabilistic 3D reconstruction and modeling of ambiguities. The main contribution is enabling 3D generative modeling with diffusion models using only readily-available 2D supervision.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work:

- It focuses on single-view 3D reconstruction and generation, a problem that is inherently ambiguous due to losing the depth dimension when projecting a 3D scene into a 2D image. Many prior works tackle 3D reconstruction in a deterministic manner and output a single reconstruction, whereas this paper seeks to model the ambiguity by sampling multiple plausible reconstructions.

- It uses denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for 3D generation. DDPMs have shown excellent results for image generation, but have not been as extensively explored for 3D data which tends to be more scarce. The key contribution is training a 3D DDPM using only multi-view 2D supervision rather than requiring 3D ground truth data.

- The method trains the DDPM to generate "viewsets", collections of rendered views, rather than 3D models directly. This allows leveraging more readily available 2D multi-view training data. The mapping between viewsets and 3D models is integrated into the diffusion model itself.

- For conditioning the diffusion model on input views, the method allows different views to have different noise levels. This enables conditional generation from any number of input views, including zero for unconditional generation. Architecturally, it uses techniques like view unprojection and cross-attention aggregation.

- It introduces a new synthetic dataset "Minens" for evaluating reconstruction ambiguity, with features like random articulation. Experiments show the advantage of modeling ambiguity on this dataset compared to deterministic approaches like PixelNeRF.

- Compared to concurrent works on image-conditioned 3D diffusion models, a key advantage is guaranteed 3D consistency of the generations rather than just approximate/intermittent consistency. The training is from only 2D data but at test time novel views are rendered directly from an estimated 3D model.

Overall, the paper makes contributions in effectively training a 3D generative diffusion model from 2D data, leveraging this for ambiguity modeling in reconstruction, and architectural/dataset innovations to enable this. The experiments demonstrate advantages over deterministic baselines.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different 3D representations beyond neural radiance fields, such as meshes, voxels, or hybrid representations. The authors note their method is compatible with any differentiable 3D formulation.

- Scaling up to higher resolutions and more complex objects and scenes. The experiments in the paper are mostly on relatively simple objects at low resolution. Applying the method to high-resolution photorealistic data could be an interesting direction.

- Modeling more complex ambiguities and sampling distributions. The paper shows modeling ambiguity improves results, but there are likely further improvements possible.

- Combining the viewset diffusion approach with latent diffusion, which has shown strong results for 2D image generation. 

- Applications of the method beyond single-view reconstruction and unconditional generation, such as few-shot reconstruction, interactive editing, or controllable generation.

- Extending the formulation for video input and video generation/reconstruction.

- Comparing to or incorporating ideas from other recent related works on multi-view diffusion models.

So in summary, some promising directions are exploring alternative 3D representations, scaling to more complex scenes, modeling ambiguity more thoroughly, combining viewset and latent diffusion, and extending the applications and use cases beyond the core ideas shown in the paper. Overall the paper establishes an interesting new approach through viewset diffusion, and there seem to be many interesting ways to build on this.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Viewset Diffusion, a method to learn a conditional generator for 3D object models using only 2D multi-view supervision. It uses denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to model the distribution of 3D objects. The key insight is that there is a bijective mapping between collections of 2D views (viewsets) of a 3D object and the 3D object itself. So the method trains a DDPM on viewsets, but designs the network to reconstruct an intermediate 3D representation, allowing it to generate 3D objects from 2D data. This supports unconditional 3D generation as well as few-view and single-view 3D reconstruction by conditioning on real input views. The method can sample multiple plausible 3D reconstructions for ambiguous inputs. It uses techniques like view unprojection and attention to aggregate information from multiple views. Experiments validate the approach and show it generates sharper and more diverse outputs compared to deterministic baselines. The method also contributes a new dataset for evaluating reconstruction ambiguity.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Viewset Diffusion for learning 3D generative models of objects from 2D multi-view supervision. The key idea is to generate "viewsets" - collections of 2D views of an object - rather than directly generating 3D models. Since there is a bijective mapping between viewsets and 3D models, this allows training the model with only 2D data. The diffusion model is designed to denoise an input viewset by reconstructing the corresponding 3D radiance field. This ensures the outputs are 3D consistent while supporting conditional generation from any number of input views.

The method is evaluated on reconstruction and generation for cars, characters, and other objects. For reconstruction, modeling ambiguity helps generate multiple sharp solutions rather than a single blurry averaged output. The same model supports unconditional sampling, generating varied 3D objects from scratch. The model matches or improves state-of-the-art baselines in metrics like PSNR and LPIPS. The reconstructions have increased visual quality over baselines. The architecture uses unprojection and attention to aggregate information from multiple views. Ablations validate design choices. Key contributions are the viewset diffusion concept, ambiguity modeling in reconstruction, and network design enabling reconstruction from varied input views.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Viewset Diffusion, a diffusion-based generative model for 3D objects that is trained using only 2D multi-view supervision. The key idea is to generate viewsets (collections of 2D views of a 3D object) instead of directly generating 3D models. Generating viewsets is easier because 2D images are directly observable, while 3D models are latent variables. The diffusion model takes as input partially noised viewsets and outputs denoised viewsets. Critically, the denoising function reconstructs an underlying 3D radiance field, ensuring the output viewsets are 3D consistent. This allows training with 2D losses while still producing 3D outputs. The same framework supports conditional generation from arbitrary numbers of input views, including single-image 3D reconstruction, by setting the noise level of conditioning views to zero. Overall, Viewset Diffusion trains a 3D generator from 2D data, handles reconstruction ambiguity by sampling outputs, and unifies conditional and unconditional 3D modelling.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of 3D reconstruction and generation from limited 2D views. Specifically:

- Single-view 3D reconstruction is inherently ambiguous as depth information is lost in projection. The paper aims to model this ambiguity by generating multiple plausible 3D reconstructions from a single input view. 

- Most prior work tackles 3D reconstruction deterministically, outputting one solution per input. This fails to capture ambiguity and leads to implausible averaged solutions. The paper proposes a conditional generative model that can sample diverse ambiguous solutions.

- Standard 3D generative models require 3D supervision. The paper aims to learn a 3D generative model from only multi-view 2D data, without access to 3D ground truth. 

- The paper proposes to generate 3D objects by generating consistent multi-view 2D datasets ("viewsets") instead. This allows training with 2D data. The generator reconstructs a latent 3D representation when denoising an input viewset.

- The same model supports conditional generation from input views as well as unconditional 3D generation, unifying the tasks in a single framework.

In summary, the key questions are:
1) How to perform ambiguous 3D reconstruction from limited 2D data? 
2) How to learn a 3D generative model from 2D data only?
3) How to unify ambiguous reconstruction and unconditional generation in a single framework?

The paper tackles these by proposing to use viewset diffusion, which can be trained on 2D data while reconstructing a latent 3D representation internally.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents Viewset Diffusion, a method that learns a generative model for 3D shape representation and rendering using only 2D multi-view supervision. It builds on diffusion probabilistic models and introduces the concept of diffusing over "viewsets" - collections of 2D views depicting a 3D object from different viewpoints - which have an approximately one-to-one mapping to 3D shape. The key insight is to design the neural network inside the diffusion model to reconstruct an entire radiance field of the 3D object, guaranteeing 3D consistency of generated viewsets. The same framework unifies conditional generation from one or more input views, corresponding to reconstruction, as well as unconditional generation by sampling the learned 3D prior. Experiments across several shape datasets demonstrate Viewset Diffusion's ability to generate objects with higher visual quality than prior work, while modeling ambiguity inherent in 3D reconstruction from limited views. The probabilistic formulation also enables sampling multiple plausible reconstructions. The method requires only renderings from 3 views per object during training, showing the effectiveness of learning a strong 3D prior.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents Viewset Diffusion, a method to learn 3D generative models from multi-view 2D data using diffusion probabilistic models. The key idea is to diffuse over viewsets (collections of 2D views of a 3D object) instead of directly diffusing over 3D data, allowing the model to be trained with only 2D supervision. The model is designed to reconstruct internally a radiance field for the 3D object corresponding to the input viewset. This allows generating consistent 3D objects from the model even though it is trained only on 2D data. The same model architecture supports image-conditional reconstruction, allowing sampling of multiple plausible 3D reconstructions from a single input view by modeling inherent ambiguities. Experiments on ShapeNet, CO3D and a new Minens dataset demonstrate improved reconstruction quality and diversity compared to deterministic baselines, and improved visual quality for unconditional 3D sample generation compared to prior diffusion-based generators operating only on single views.
