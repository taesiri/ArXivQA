# [WILBUR: Adaptive In-Context Learning for Robust and Accurate Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05902)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing web agents fail to generalize across websites due to high variance in structure. Fine-tuning and in-context learning also fail to generalize.
- Memorizing all websites is infeasible, so zero-shot approaches likely to fail. 

Proposed Solution - Wilbur Agent:
- Explore, reflect and backtrack: Faced with novel website, takes action sampled from LLM. Reflection LM verifies if action contributes progress. If fail, backtracks to previous successful state.
- Retrieve demonstrations from scalable knowledge bank: Includes goal-conditioned demos teaching how to perform similar task on potentially unseen website. Also website-conditioned demos teaching how to act on similar web page. 
- Demo ranking model selects most helpful demos to populate prompt. 
- Summarizes demos into concise instructions allowing large number to be included.

Main Contributions:
- First web agent that can recover from delayed mistakes by modeling task as graph exploration and navigating back.
- Proposes learning in-context from previous executions on similar pages/goals. Uses demo ranking model and summarizes demos into instructions.
- First to apply autocurriculum strategy with LLM scoring to obtain high quality training data without human feedback. 
- Achieves new text-only SOTA of 53% on WebVoyager benchmark, 8% higher than previous text-only SOTA. Within 5% of strong multimodal model.
