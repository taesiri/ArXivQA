# [Alchemist: Parametric Control of Material Properties with Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02970)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Alchemist for editing the material properties like roughness, metallic, albedo, and transparency of objects in real images. The key idea is to leverage the generative capabilities and photorealism of text-to-image diffusion models. To address the lack of datasets with precise material property annotations, the authors render a synthetic dataset of 100 3D objects with randomized physically-based materials, lighting, and cameras. They then fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model on this dataset to enable parametric control of material properties from a context image, scalar strength parameter, and text prompt specifying the object class. Despite training only on synthetic data, Alchemist generalizes effectively to real images, as demonstrated through high-quality and smooth editing results. Comparisons show superior performance over GAN-based and prompt engineering baselines in terms of photorealism, faithfulness, and user preference. Extensions showcase spatial localization of edits and multi-attribute control. The method is also applied to material editing of neural radiance fields. Limitations include minimal changes for some properties and occasionally unrealistic transparency. Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in precise image-based material editing by capitalizing on the generative prior of text-to-image models.
