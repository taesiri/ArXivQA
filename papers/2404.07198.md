# [Zero-shot Logical Query Reasoning on any Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing methods for complex logical query answering (CLQA) in knowledge graphs learn embeddings for entities and relations which makes them transductive and unable to generalize to queries over graphs with new entities or relations. The paper focuses on the inductive CLQA setup where queries at inference time involve completely new graphs, entities, and relations not seen during training. No existing CLQA approach can handle this.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes UltraQuery, the first inductive CLQA model that can generalize to any knowledge graph with new entities and relations at inference time. UltraQuery has two key components:

1) Inductive relation projection operator: This is implemented using Ultra, a recently proposed inductive knowledge graph reasoning model. Ultra uses a meta-graph to represent relations and builds relation representations dynamically. This allows generalization to any relations.

2) Non-parametric logical operators: Conjunction, disjunction and negation are implemented using fuzzy logics that operate on probability scores to enable vocabulary-independent reasoning.

Together, these components allow UltraQuery to execute logical queries with both new entities and relations at test time. A single UltraQuery model is trained on queries from one graph and tested on completely new graphs without any finetuning.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first CLQA model that can generalize to any graph with new entities and relations, enabling zero-shot query answering.

- Introduces inductive relation projection operator by leveraging recent advances in inductive knowledge graph reasoning. First to tackle the resulting multi-source propagation issue in CLQA.

- Empirically demonstrates strong performance - a single UltraQuery model outperforms specialized baselines by 50% averaged on 23 datasets. Sets new SOTA on 14 datasets.

- Curates 11 new inductive CLQA benchmarks based on WikiTopics to facilitate future research on inductive CLQA.

The key insight is to make both the projection operator and logical operations inductive using recent techniques, instead of relying on entity/relation embeddings. This enables tackling the most challenging inductive CLQA setup in a zero-shot manner.
