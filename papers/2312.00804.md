# [Automatic detection of problem-gambling signs from online texts using   large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Problem gambling is a major public health issue associated with negative consequences like financial difficulties, family problems, etc. It is important to detect early signs of problem gambling for preventive measures.
- Online gambling forums contain useful information about gambling experiences and problems that can provide insights into problem gambling behavior. However, manually analyzing large volumes of forum posts is difficult.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using natural language processing and machine learning to automatically detect signatures of problem gambling from posts in a major German online gambling forum.

- They manually annotated over 500 forum posts based on diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder from DSM-5 and gambling-related cognitive distortions from the Gambling Related Cognitions Scale. Posts describing problem gambling behavior, related problems, or distorted cognitions were labelled as problem gambling (target class). Others were labelled as just gambling posts (non-target class).

- They fine-tuned a pretrained German BERT model (a type of transformer model) on the annotated posts to classify a post as target or non-target. 

Main Contributions:
- Manual annotation of forum posts for model training based on validated clinical criteria, ensuring high quality labels.

- Achieved high precision of 0.95 and F1 score of 0.71 using just 348 labelled posts per class, demonstrating BERT's viability for small datasets.

- Confirms the feasibility of automatically detecting signatures of problem gambling from online texts using machine learning.

- The computational approach has potential for monitoring changes in problem gambling prevalence among online gambling platform users.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of manual annotation guided by diagnostic criteria to train a machine learning model to automatically detect signs of problem gambling from online posts with high precision. The model performance despite small training data highlights the utility of leveraging pretrained language models like BERT.
