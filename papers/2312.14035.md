# [GRIL-Calib: Targetless Ground Robot IMU-LiDAR Extrinsic Calibration   Method using Ground Plane Motion Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing targetless IMU-LiDAR extrinsic calibration methods require sufficient motion excitation in all axes to accurately estimate the 6DOF spatial transformation. However, for ground robots, the motion is restricted to 2D planar motion, making existing methods likely to fail or have poor accuracy. Specifically, the planar motion makes some parameters unobservable and the Fisher information matrix can become rank deficient. 

Proposed Solution - GRIL-Calib:
The paper proposes a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework called GRIL-Calib tailored for ground robots. It utilizes ground plane constraints to compensate for planar motion and enables full 6DOF calibration. The key aspects are:

1) LiDAR Odometry (LO) using ground plane residuals to reduce drift, especially along the z-axis. This improves calibration accuracy.

2) Formulation of a new Ground Plane Motion (GPM) constraint based on sensor height from ground and ground plane observations. This constraint enables estimation of unobservable parameters.

3) Single joint optimization formulation to estimate all parameters simultaneously rather than separate sequential optimization. This captures inter-parameter correlations better.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of GPM constraint to leverage ground information for 6DOF calibration under planar motion
- Enhanced LO using ground plane residuals to reduce z-axis drift  
- Single optimization formulation for joint parameter estimation
- State-of-the-art accuracy on 3 public datasets with up to 75% lower rotation error and 79% lower translation error compared to prior works
- Demonstrated improved odometry accuracy when used with IMU-LiDAR fusion system

In summary, the paper presents a novel constrained optimization approach for IMU-LiDAR calibration on ground robots by exploiting ground information, achieving much higher accuracy than prior targetless methods.
