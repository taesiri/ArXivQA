# [Lower Bounds for Differential Privacy Under Continual Observation and   Online Threshold Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Studied:
The paper studies the continual observation model of differential privacy where an algorithm processes a stream of sensitive data over time and continually updates its statistics while preserving privacy. The key problem studied is the private counter problem of privately tracking the number of events in an online fashion. 

Prior Work: 
Previous work gave upper bounds of $O(\log T + \log^2 n)$ on the error and lower bounds of $\Omega(\min\{\log T, \log n\})$. However, these bounds apply even to the easier offline setting and do not differentiate between the online and offline continual observation models.

Main Contributions:
The paper presents the following key contributions:

1. A new lower bound of $\Omega(\min\{n, \log T\})$ on the error for the private online counter problem. This bound is tight in terms of dependence on $T$ and tight for sparse instances. 

2. The lower bound implies the first separation between private and non-private online learners in terms of mistake bounds.

3. The techniques also give the first separation between standard private online learning and the recently proposed private online prediction model.

4. The lower bound is shown via a reduction from the threshold monitor problem. A key insight is that by dividing the stream into halves recursively, the multiplicative differential privacy blow up can be reduced to factor of $1/2$.

5. The lower bound also applies to the online threshold queries problem, resolving an open question on whether a $\Omega(\log T)$ lower bound applies.

In summary, the paper presents novel lower bound techniques for the continual observation model that exploit the online arrival of data. This is used to prove tight lower bounds for the private online counter problem and related problems.
