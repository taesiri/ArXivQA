# [KGLens: A Parameterized Knowledge Graph Solution to Assess What an LLM   Does and Doesn't Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11539)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing approaches for evaluating large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs have limitations: they ignore the graph structure, make arbitrary choices of which parts to evaluate, use unnatural text cloze tasks, and lack efficiency for assessing reliability.

Proposed Solution - KGLens:
- Introduces a parameterized knowledge graph (PKG) where each edge has a beta distribution indicating the LLM's proficiency. This allows structured and efficient assessment.  
- Samples challenging edges from PKG for question generation based on edge probabilities. Questions are more natural via graph-guided strategy.
- Evaluates LLM responses to generated questions. Signals are used to update edge beta distributions in PKG.
- Iterative evaluation until metrics converge to visualize LLM knowledge boundaries.

Key Contributions:
- Efficient method to visualize and assess factual knowledge in LLMs using adaptable PKG structure.
- PKG allows customized analysis (e.g. temporal, relation-based).
- More natural graph-guided question generation instead of cloze tasks. 
- Developed 3 large domain-specific KGs from Wikidata for evaluation.

In summary, KGLens provides an efficient, adaptable and natural way to evaluate what knowledge is present or lacking in LLMs by leveraging knowledge graph structure and question generation. The parameterized knowledge graph enables customized analysis.
