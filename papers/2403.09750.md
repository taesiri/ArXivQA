# [Meta-Cognitive Analysis: Evaluating Declarative and Procedural Knowledge   in Datasets and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09750)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are two main types of knowledge that are important for human cognition: declarative (facts and concepts) and procedural (skills and processes). Both types have been shown to exist in large language models (LLMs).
- However, there has been little systematic analysis on the relative impact of these two knowledge types on the capabilities of LLMs across different models, tasks, and training paradigms. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel in-context knowledge injection approach to explore the effects of declarative and procedural knowledge on LLM performance. 
- Ground truth declarative or procedural knowledge related to the question is provided to the LLM as hints. Performance with and without these hints is compared.

Experiments:
- Experiments were conducted on 32 LLMs and 13 evaluation datasets covering math, commonsense, reasoning tasks. 
- Three types of hints were provided: declarative only, procedural only, and combined (both declarative and procedural).

Key Findings:  
- Declarative knowledge has more impact than procedural knowledge on performance improvements across most tasks.
- Procedural knowledge only helps more in reasoning tasks with simple logic flows.
- As models scale up in size and training, their ability to utilize both knowledge types improves at different paces.

Main Contributions:
- A novel analysis method to evaluate the effects of declarative and procedural knowledge on LLMs by directly providing these knowledge types as in-context hints.
- New findings on the differential impacts of declarative vs procedural knowledge on model capabilities across models, tasks and scales.
- Quantitative assessment of how abilities of LLMs to leverage these knowledge types change during pre-training.

The key insight is that explicitly providing LLMs with declarative and procedural knowledge reveals their capabilities to utilize these knowledge types for reasoning and problem solving. This can inform efforts to improve LLM design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the impact of injecting declarative and procedural knowledge on the performance of large language models across different tasks, finding that declarative knowledge benefits most tasks more than procedural knowledge, with the exception of simple reasoning tasks, and that models' ability to utilize both knowledge types improves with scale and pre-training, but at different rates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a novel method to investigate the impact of declarative and procedural knowledge on large language model performance through in-context knowledge injection. Specifically, the paper:

1) Designs an exploration approach that provides ground truth declarative and/or procedural knowledge relevant to the question input. This allows measuring the potential benefits of adding these knowledge types.

2) Conducts experiments across 32 LLMs and 13 datasets covering diverse tasks to compare model capabilities with vs without injected knowledge.

3) Finds that declarative knowledge leads to greater performance gains than procedural in most tasks, while procedural is more useful in logical reasoning. Also, abilities to utilize both knowledge types improve with scale and pre-training, but at different paces.

4) Provides a new perspective and quantification on the role of declarative and procedural knowledge in LLMs. The method introduced allows better understanding these knowledge types' implications on model capabilities.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel in-context knowledge injection method to systematically examine declarative and procedural knowledge's impact on LLMs across models, tasks and training stages. This provides new insights into these knowledge types' effects on large language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How exactly do the authors design the declarative and procedural hints to inject into the context? What considerations go into formulating these hints?

2. The paper mentions examining 32 openly available LLMs. What is the rationale behind selecting this specific set of models rather than a smaller or larger group? 

3. What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the LLMs on the 13 tasks with and without injected knowledge hints? Why are those metrics chosen?

4. Does the relative impact of declarative vs procedural knowledge change depending on the specifics of the task? If so, how?

5. How sensitive are the results to the exact formulation of the declarative and procedural hints? How is this sensitivity analyzed?  

6. Are certain classes of models better able to take advantage of injected knowledge hints? If so, what architectural or scaling factors contribute to this?

7. Could the knowledge injection method be productized to improve real-world LLM performance? What limitations would need to be overcome?  

8. Does combining declarative and procedural knowledge provide more benefit than either one alone? Is the effect additive or superadditive?

9. How efficient are current LLMs at internalizing injected knowledge for later reuse? Could transfer learning experiments elucidate this?

10. Could similar knowledge injection experiments shed light on differences between human and artificial intelligence with respect to utilizing declarative vs procedural information?
