# [Bergeron: Combating Adversarial Attacks through a Conscience-Based   Alignment Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00029)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Modern large language models (LLMs) can still generate problematic responses that are misaligned with human values, despite advances in alignment methods. 
- Current alignment approaches have limitations - they are expensive, can degrade model performance if applied too aggressively, and still leave models vulnerable to attacks.
- As a result, many models exhibit bias, can be "jailbroken" into giving unsafe responses, undergo minimal alignment training, or overly aggressive unsafe training.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose Bergeron, a modular framework designed to add an extra layer of safety to a model's existing alignment approach without compromising performance.  
- It has a two-tiered architecture - a primary user-facing LLM that interacts with users, and a secondary "conscience" LLM that oversees inputs/outputs of the primary LLM.
- The secondary LLM identifies potentially hazardous text and only intervenes when necessary to make adjustments to prompts or responses.  
- Bergeron aims to function as a wrapper for primary LLMs to enhance their alignment by providing redundant prompt and response protections.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of Bergeron, a flexible framework to improve LLM robustness against attacks by monitoring and steering responses.
- Demonstration that Bergeron can enhance alignment and robustness of several popular LLMs without costly fine-tuning.
- Creation of a dataset of 84 adversarial prompts to evaluate model alignments using 13 templates covering different weaknesses.
- Empirical evaluation showing Bergeron reduces failure rates across models and a variety of attacks, especially for large models with extensive alignment training.
- Analysis providing insight into how models self-correct using disclaimers, and how this can be leveraged to increase framework effectiveness.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel conscience-based dual LLM architecture that demonstrably hardens language models against misalignment vulnerabilities and attacks by building on their existing knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Bergeron, a two-tiered framework that uses a secondary "conscience" model to monitor and steer the inputs and outputs of a primary language model in order to improve its alignment with human preferences and defend it against adversarial attacks, without significantly compromising performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is introducing a framework called "Bergeron" to improve the robustness of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) Proposing a two-tiered architecture with a primary LLM that interacts with users, and a secondary "conscience" LLM that monitors the inputs and outputs to detect potential alignment failures or misalignments.

2) The secondary LLM performs functions like rephrasing prompts, providing "conscience suggestions" to warn the primary LLM, critiquing potentially unsafe text, and correcting misaligned responses. This provides redundant protection against attacks.

3) Demonstrating that this framework can improve alignment and robustness of several LLMs like GPT-3.5, Llama2-70B, and Mistral-7B without costly fine-tuning. It complements their existing alignment training.

4) Creating a dataset of adversarial prompts to evaluate model robustness against different types of attacks targeting alignment vulnerabilities.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a flexible framework called Bergeron to harden LLMs against adversarial attacks by using a secondary LLM as a safeguarding "conscience".


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Alignment - The process of modifying a language model to better conform to human preferences and values. Aligning responses with human expectations.

- Adversarial attacks - Carefully crafted inputs designed to trick the model into generating harmful, biased, or otherwise problematic responses that violate alignment.

- Jailbreaking - Exploiting vulnerabilities in a model's training to bypass alignment and get the model to produce unsafe or rule-violating outputs. 

- Prompt engineering - Techniques for carefully constructing prompts to steer model behavior in a desired direction, used both for alignment and adversarial attacks.

- Conscience model - The secondary model in the proposed Bergeron framework that acts as a safeguard and monitor for the primary model. Checks for unsafe content.

- Two-tiered architecture - The overall structure of Bergeron with two models, primary and conscience, working together to enhance safety.

- Disclaimers - Statements generated by models indicating unsafe content and discouraging further discussion, used by Bergeron to reduce unsafe responses.

- Robustness - Ability of a model to defend itself against attacks and failures through alignment. Bergeron aims to improve model robustness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-tiered architecture with a primary LLM and a secondary "conscience" LLM. What are the key responsibilities and functions of each model in this framework? How do they interact?

2. The conscience model performs functions like rephrasing, conscience suggestion, critique, and correction. Can you expand more on what each of these entails? What kind of logic or algorithms are used? 

3. The paper talks about maximizing the disclaimer effectiveness function E. What are the key variables involved here and how can E be maximized in practice when implementing this framework?

4. The secondary model seems to play a crucial role in steering and adjusting the responses of the primary model. What measures are taken to ensure the secondary model itself does not get manipulated or fail? How do you establish redundancy?

5. The Bergeron framework aims to improve robustness against adversarial attacks without compromising too much on performance. What metrics are used to evaluate these two criteria? What were the key results?

6. The paper tested the framework on models like Llama2, GPT-3.5 and Mistral. What differences did you observe in terms of how models of different sizes and with different alignment training responded?

7. The framework utilizes some pre-existing techniques like erase-and-check and smoothLLM. How and where are these integrated? What modifications were made to suit the goals of this framework?  

8. The attack dataset uses 13 templates covering areas like shell emulation, insults etc. What principles or techniques were leveraged to engineer effective adversarial prompts here? 

9. The alignment flow diagram shows critiquing the partial generated text. Is a iterative critiquing and correction process explored? If yes, what results does it yield compared to single-pass critique?

10. The paper mentions ablations studies as future work. What aspects of the framework would you modify or ablate in the ablation study to better analyze the impact of different components?
