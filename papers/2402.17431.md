# [The KANDY Benchmark: Incremental Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning   with Kandinsky Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for new AI benchmarks that can test systems on abstract reasoning tasks beyond plain pattern recognition. This is especially important for neuro-symbolic AI which combines neural and symbolic methods.
- Existing benchmarks have limitations e.g. solvable by injecting knowledge, require language understanding, not focused on compositionality and incremental learning.
- There is a lack of diagnostic benchmarks to separately evaluate the perceptual vs reasoning skills of models.

Solution:
- The authors propose KANDY - a new benchmark inspired by Kandinsky patterns for incremental neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning.
- KANDY generates binary classification tasks of increasing complexity using simple geometric shapes and compositional rules.
- The tasks are organized in curriculum-style with simpler concepts first. Supervisions can be made sparse.  
- Samples map to symbolic representations allowing to evaluate perceptual vs reasoning skills separately.
- Two curricula released - an "easy" and a "hard" benchmark.

Contributions:
- Benchmark combines visual scene understanding with reasoning, exhibiting the binding problem.
- Allows evaluation in continual and semi-supervised settings.
- Focuses on object compositionality and building hierarchical representations.
- Includes symbolic ground truth rules to enable analysis of interpretable solutions.   
- Released generator allows users to create custom benchmarks.
- Experiments show limitations of both neural and symbolic methods, motivating need for neuro-symbolic approaches.

So in summary, KANDY is a new compositional visual reasoning benchmark tailored for neuro-symbolic AI with in-built diagnostics. It is designed to spur research at the intersection of multiple subfields. Both neural and symbolic methods struggle with the tasks, showing the need for integrated learning & reasoning.
