# [Empowering Air Travelers: A Chatbot for Canadian Air Passenger Rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12678)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Air travel in Canada has seen many challenges recently regarding passenger rights, with increasing flight delays, cancellations, and baggage issues. 
- Passengers have many questions about their rights and options, but there is limited capacity from human volunteers to handle the growing number of inquiries.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a conversational chatbot to assist passengers by providing accurate and timely information about air travel regulations and passenger rights. 
- The chatbot uses natural language processing techniques including a large language model (LLM) and dense passage retrieval to understand complex user inputs and retrieve relevant information from authoritative documents.

Key Contributions:
- The chatbot simplifies multi-faceted questions into simpler queries to enable focused information retrieval. 
- It presents users with the generated questions and corresponding passages from documents instead of a synthesized response. This prevents hallucinations and allows users to view reliable information to apply to their circumstances.
- Extensive user studies demonstrate the chatbot's usefulness, ease of use and high user satisfaction compared to a Google search. 
- The chatbot provides a way to leverage recent advances in NLP to improve accessibility and accuracy of legal information for passengers.
- It introduces an approach for developing zero-hallucination chatbots crucial for domains like law and medicine where accuracy is imperative.

In summary, the paper presents an explainable chatbot that empowers passengers by providing accurate information on air travel regulations, while avoiding risks from model hallucinations. User studies confirm the system's effectiveness over search engines.
