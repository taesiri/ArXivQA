# [Scaffold-GS: Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00109)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Scaffold-Gaussian Splatting (Scaffold-GS), a new method for view-adaptive rendering of 3D scenes. It builds on 3D-GS by structuring the 3D Gaussians in a hierarchical manner using anchor points derived from a sparse voxel grid of SfM points. Each anchor spawns a set of neural Gaussians dynamically based on viewing direction and distance, predicting their attributes like opacity, color, rotation, and scale on-the-fly. This allows efficiently adapting the representation to novel views without overfitting to training views. Anchor growing and pruning strategies refine the coverage over scenes. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate Scaffold-GS achieves comparable or higher quality rendering than prior state-of-the-art with similar speed, while requiring much lower storage through significantly reducing redundancy. Key benefits are robustness to challenging cases like view changes, lighting effects, texture-less regions, transparency and reflections. The compact scene representation also exhibits some semantic clustering indicating potential for applications in large-scale modeling, manipulation and interpretation.
