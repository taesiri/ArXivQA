# [SCALER: Versatile Multi-Limbed Robot for Free-Climbing in Extreme   Terrains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04856)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents SCALER, a versatile quadrupedal robot designed for advanced loco-grasping and free-climbing capabilities. SCALER features a spinal linkage torso mechanism and hybrid parallel-serial legs to balance power-intensive climbing with dexterous grasping. It uses novel GOAT grippers, which are underactuated two-fingered grippers able to realize 7 modes of grasping, enabling multi-modal loco-grasping strategies. SCALER demonstrates dynamic climbing up to 13.8x faster than previous platforms using pneumatically actuated GOAT grippers. With spine and C-shaped dry adhesive GOAT finger enhancements, SCALER can grasp a wide variety of terrains, including slippery upside-down ceilings and vertical concrete. Experiments validate traversing challenging environments like overhangs, bouldering walls, and utilizing whole-body techniques to overcome obstacles. Comparisons show SCALER achieves state-of-the-art quadruped locomotion metrics. By advancing versatility in loco-grasping, SCALER establishes new capabilities for legged climbing robots.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the field of climbing robots and loco-grasping platforms:

1. It proposes the design and implementation of SCALER, a versatile free-climbing quadruped robot with a torso linkage and parallel-serial limbs. SCALER demonstrates dynamic climbing and multi-modal grasping capabilities.

2. It presents two versions of the GOAT gripper for SCALER - one with spine fingertips for rough surfaces, and one with C-shaped dry adhesive fingers for realizing 7 modes of grasping, including sidepull whole-body techniques.

3. It introduces modified climbing gaits like the SKATE gait utilizing the torso linkage and a modified trot gait leveraging limb compliance. Experiments validate the efficacy of these gaits.

4. It provides extensive experimental validation of SCALER traversing challenging terrains like vertical walls, overhangs, ceilings, and bouldering walls. Key metrics like climbing speeds, payloads, and versatility across terrains are benchmarked. 

In summary, the main contribution is the design, implementation and thorough benchmarking of SCALER as an advanced versatile climbing and loco-grasping robot platform using dynamic gaits and multi-modal grasping. SCALER advances the state-of-the-art in quadruped free-climbing robots.
