# [Coherent energy and force uncertainty in deep learning force fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04174)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a machine learning approach for modeling potential energy surfaces and associated forces for atomic systems, while also providing coherent uncertainty estimates for both energies and forces. Typically, forces are obtained by taking the derivative of the predicted energy surface, but this does not allow propagation of energy uncertainty to force uncertainty under common white noise assumptions. The authors instead assume a spatially correlated noise model, where the autocorrelation function depends on the difference in positions. This results in closed-form expressions for the variance of forces based on the predicted energy variance and variance gradient. The approach is demonstrated on message passing neural network ensembles trained on molecular dynamics datasets, showing comparable accuracy to prior methods while providing reliable and calibrated uncertainty estimates. A key advantage is the ability to learn coherent energy and force uncertainties from a single model output, avoiding the need for separate uncertainty predictions. An important aspect requiring further investigation is the length scale parameter of the noise model. Overall, the proposed perspective promises improved interpretability and data efficiency for machine learning of atomic force fields.
