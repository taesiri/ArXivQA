# [Tuning Language Models by Proxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Tuning Language Models by Proxy":

Problem:
- Large pretrained language models (LMs) benefit from further tuning to achieve desired behaviors, but directly tuning them is increasingly resource intensive. 
- There is also a need to customize even proprietary LMs whose weights are private.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces "proxy-tuning", a lightweight decoding-time algorithm that steers a large base LM by using a small tuned LM as an "expert" and its untuned version as an "anti-expert".  
- Specifically, it applies the difference between the expert and anti-expert's logits as an offset to the base model's logits. This shifts the base model's predictions towards the direction of tuning, without accessing its weights.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates proxy-tuning for instruction-tuning, domain adaptation and task finetuning. When steering large Llama models with only 7B experts, it closes 88-91% of the performance gap compared to directly tuning them.
- Shows proxy-tuning can enable models to follow strict syntactic constraints learned only by the expert. On math problems, it contributes more to formulating reasoning steps than factual statements.  
- Analyzes the method's influence at the token level - it mainly promotes reasoning tokens and stylistic changes similar to direct instruction tuning.
- Introduces a hyperparameter that controls steering strength and allows trading off between attributes like truthfulness and informativeness.
- Overall, it enables efficient customization of large or proprietary LMs through small tuned models at decoding-time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces proxy-tuning, a lightweight decoding-time algorithm that steers a large pretrained language model towards desired behaviors by contrasting a small tuned model (the "expert") and its untuned version (the "anti-expert"), without accessing the base model's parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a lightweight decoding-time algorithm called "proxy-tuning" that can steer a large pretrained language model to act like a tuned model without directly accessing or modifying the model's parameters. 

Specifically, proxy-tuning tunes a smaller language model, then uses the difference between the predictions of the small tuned and untuned models to shift the predictions of the original large pretrained model in the desired direction of tuning. This allows users to achieve the benefits of tuning large models without the high resource costs, and also enables customization of proprietary models where only predictions/logits are accessible.

Through experiments on instruction-tuning, domain adaptation, and task finetuning, the paper shows proxy-tuning can reach 88-91% of the performance gains of directly tuning large models, while only tuning smaller 7B parameter models. The method is also analyzed to show it promotes reasoning and stylistic tokens more than factual knowledge. Overall, proxy-tuning enables efficient customization of large pretrained models to user needs through lightweight decoding-time guidance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Proxy-tuning - The main method introduced in the paper, which steers a large language model at decoding time using a small tuned model to achieve improved performance without modifying the base model's parameters. 

- Decoding-time guidance - The paper demonstrates the promise of using small tuned language models to efficiently customize large models through instructions provided at inference time rather than via parameter updates.

- Instruction-tuning - One application area explored is using proxy-tuning to mimic the effect of instruction-tuning (supervised dialogue training) large models.

- Domain adaptation - Experiments also apply proxy-tuning for domain adaptation, such as tuning models on code. 

- Task-specific finetuning - The method is also shown to be effective for task-specific tuning, enabling untuned models to adhere to the structural constraints of problems seen only during expert tuning.

- Logit modification - The technical approach is based on modifying the logit scores of the base model using the difference between a tuned expert model and its untuned version.

- Efficient finetuning - The paper situates proxy-tuning in the context of work on efficiently customizing large pretrained models.

In summary, the key terms cover the proposed method itself, its applications demonstrated, the underlying technique, and the motivation surrounding efficient adaptation of large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the proxy-tuning method proposed in the paper:

1. Proxy-tuning aims to steer a large pretrained language model without accessing its weights. How does it achieve this goal, and why is being able to customize models without accessing weights useful?

2. The paper experiments with using proxy-tuning for instruction-tuning, domain adaptation, and task finetuning. What are the key results for each of these scenarios? How much of the performance gap with directly tuned models is closed?

3. The paper finds that sometimes proxy-tuning large models can actually outperform directly tuned models, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Why might this occur, and what does this suggest about the tradeoffs between decoding-time guidance and directly updating model weights?

4. When proxy-tuning is applied for code adaptation, why doesn't using a larger base model provide additional gains over just using the small tuned expert? How does this differ from the instruction-tuning experiments?

5. For the analysis on which tokens are most influenced by proxy-tuning, what does the comparison between left-hand side and right-hand side tokens in math problems suggest about what proxy-tuning/instruction tuning affects?

6. The paper introduces an alpha hyperparameter that controls the strength of steering from the expert and anti-expert. How does adjusting alpha impact tradeoffs in model performance on the TruthfulQA benchmark?

7. What computational overhead does proxy-tuning introduce compared to decoding directly from the base model? How could the method be optimized to improve runtime efficiency?  

8. How exactly does proxy-tuning guide or shift the original next-token probabilities of the base model? Can you walk through the math of how the expert and anti-expert differences are applied?

9. The related works section discusses contemporary works that also aim to modify model behavior at decoding time. How does proxy-tuning differ from these other approaches? What are its advantages?

10. What questions remain unanswered about proxy-tuning? What future work could be done to better understand its capabilities and limitations?
