# [Learning To Guide Human Decision Makers With Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16501)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing hybrid human-AI decision making (HDM) approaches follow a "separation of responsibilities" where inputs are routed to either a human or an AI, but not both. This can lead to issues like over-reliance on the AI (automation bias) or the human being left completely unassisted on hard cases.
- These issues make existing HDM approaches poorly suited for high-stakes scenarios like healthcare where human oversight is critical.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose "learning to guide" (LTG) where rather than taking decisions, the AI provides interpretable guidance to assist the human in making better decisions. 
- They introduce SLOG, an approach to turn vision-language models into guidance generators using human feedback. It uses a surrogate model to estimate downstream decision quality from limited annotations.
- The guidance aims to be interpretable and informative to improve individual and overall decisions while keeping the human in the loop.

Key Contributions:
- Identify flaws in existing HDM methods around synergy and reliability.
- Propose LTG to address these by ensuring humans remain responsible for all decisions.
- Develop SLOG to convert vision-language models into textual guidance generators using estimated human feedback.
- Empirically demonstrate SLOG can improve informativeness of guidance and quality of downstream decisions on a medical diagnosis task.

In summary, the key idea is that rather than separating responsibilities, the AI should provide useful guidance to assist the human expert who remains responsible for all decisions. SLOG shows promise for turning language models into better guidance generators.
