# [Policy Smoothing for Provably Robust Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11420)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Can randomized smoothing techniques be adapted to provide provable robustness guarantees for reinforcement learning policies against adversarial attacks?

The key contributions towards addressing this question appear to be:

1) Proving an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma that allows deriving robustness guarantees for sequential decision making processes like RL where the adversary can adapt based on previous observations. 

2) Proposing a policy smoothing technique that adds Gaussian noise to the policy's inputs at each timestep, and showing theoretically that this allows certifying the total episodic reward against adversarial attacks.

3) Demonstrating the approach empirically on RL environments like Cartpole, Pong, Freeway and Mountain Car, and showing it can provide non-trivial robustness certificates.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that randomized smoothing can be extended to provide provable robustness for RL, which the authors address through theoretical analysis and empirical demonstrations. The key novelty is adapting the theory and techniques to handle the sequential adaptive nature of RL environments and adversaries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a defense procedure called Policy Smoothing for making reinforcement learning (RL) policies provably robust against adversarial attacks. Policy Smoothing involves adding Gaussian noise to the policy's observations before passing them through the policy network. 

2. It proves an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to generate robustness certificates for policy smoothing in the RL setting. This adaptive Neyman-Pearson lemma shows that a structured adversary that uses up its entire budget in the first time step lower bounds the performance of any general adversary. 

3. Using the adaptive Neyman-Pearson lemma, it derives a robustness certificate that lower bounds the total expected reward obtained by a smoothed policy against any norm-bounded adversarial attack.

4. It shows that the robustness certificates achieved for policy smoothing are tight, meaning the bounds are the best possible unless restrictive assumptions are made about the RL environment. This is done by constructing a worst-case environment that achieves the certified bounds.

5. It demonstrates through experiments on environments like Cartpole, Pong, Freeway and Mountain Car that policy smoothing can provide meaningful robustness guarantees in practice. The lower bounds on performance exceed the actual performance of undefended policies under attack in some cases.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing policy smoothing for RL based on an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma and showing it can provide non-vacuous robustness guarantees on complex RL benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of provable robustness for deep reinforcement learning:

- Focuses on randomized smoothing defenses: This paper specifically looks at using randomized smoothing techniques like adding Gaussian noise to inputs to achieve robustness certificates. Other works have used different techniques like interval bound propagation, curvature bounds, adversarial training, etc. 

- Considers adaptive adversaries: A key contribution is accounting for adversaries that can adapt to the defense over time by observing states, actions, etc. Some prior works only consider static adversaries that don't adapt.

- Certifies total reward rather than step-wise actions: This paper provides guarantees directly on the total reward over a full episode. Many previous works focused on certifying that the action taken at each individual time step remains robust.

- Applicable to general RL settings: The proposed method and analysis does not make restrictive assumptions about the type of policy, environment dynamics, etc. It can be applied broadly to RL systems. Other techniques are sometimes tailored to specific policy classes like Deep Q-Networks.

- Provides tightness results: The paper analyzes a worst-case environment showing the certificates achieved are the best possible given the threat model. Not all prior work provides this type of tightness analysis.

- Emphasizes model-agnostic certificates: The policy smoothing technique can be applied without knowledge of the agent's policy model. Some other methods rely more heavily on properties of the policy representation.

Overall, this paper extends the progress on provable robustness to the more challenging and realistic setting of adaptive adversaries in reinforcement learning. The proposed certificates apply broadly while still remaining tight for the given threat model.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extending the proposed method to other adversaries and smoothing distributions beyond the isometric Gaussian case considered in this work. The authors suggest investigating how their procedure could be generalized for other types of attacks and smoothing distributions.

- Applying policy smoothing to the multi-agent RL setting where one of the agents acts adversarially. The authors propose using policy smoothing to make an agent's observations more robust in environments where it is interacting with other agents, some of which may behave adversarially.

- Using policy smoothing for real-world control problems with complex dynamics. The authors discuss the potential of policy smoothing to inspire new techniques for achieving robustness in dynamic real-world control tasks like robotics.

- Scaling up policy smoothing and the associated theory to large, complex RL environments. The authors note the need to demonstrate the scalability of their approach to be able to handle more complex, high-dimensional RL problems.

- Tightening the robustness certificates achieved by policy smoothing. The authors suggest further work could aim to make their certificates tighter for certain settings by making assumptions about the environment or policy.

- Exploring connections to other areas like safe RL, distributional RL, and offline RL. The authors propose investigating if ideas from policy smoothing could have implications for some of these related subfields of RL research.

In summary, the main suggestions are to extend and scale up the method to broader settings, tighten the guarantees it provides, and explore connections to other RL research directions that could benefit from the notions of policy smoothing and certifiable robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method for achieving provable robustness guarantees for reinforcement learning (RL) policies against adversarial attacks. The key idea is to apply randomized smoothing, a technique originally developed for providing certified robustness in static machine learning models like image classifiers. The paper adapts the theory behind randomized smoothing to the dynamic and adaptive setting of reinforcement learning. In particular, it proves an "adaptive" version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma that allows deriving robustness guarantees when the adversary can adapt based on past observations. 

Based on this theoretical result, the paper develops a simple technique called Policy Smoothing where Gaussian noise is added to the policy's observations at each timestep before feeding to the policy network. This allows providing certified lower bounds on the total expected reward that the policy will obtain even in the worst-case presence of a norm-bounded adversary. The guarantees apply broadly without needing to make assumptions about the policy model or environment dynamics. The analysis considers a general RL setting modeled via interactions between two abstract systems and is not limited to standard MDPs. Empirically, the method is shown to provide non-trivial robustness certificates on Atari games and control tasks. The certificates guarantee smoothed policies collect higher reward under attack than even the empirical performance of undefended policies. Overall, the paper extends the benefits of randomized smoothing based certified defenses to the complex yet widely used setting of deep reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for making reinforcement learning agents provably robust against adversarial attacks on their observations. Reinforcement learning agents are vulnerable to attacks where small perturbations are added to their observations to degrade their performance. Prior defense methods certify robustness by requiring the policy's action to remain unchanged at every timestep. However, this approach fails if the action changes even at one timestep. The key insight of this paper is that directly certifying the total cumulative reward, without requiring robustness at every timestep, provides a more meaningful notion of robustness. 

The main contribution is an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to handle the sequential and adaptive nature of attacks in reinforcement learning. This allows deriving robustness certificates for "policy smoothing", where Gaussian noise is added to the agent's observations before feeding into the policy. The certificates lower bound the total expected reward under any norm-bounded attack, even if actions at intermediate steps may change. Experiments on Atari games and control tasks demonstrate the approach can provide non-trivial robustness guarantees. The certificates outperform the empirical robustness of undefended agents under attack in some environments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a defense method called Policy Smoothing for providing provable robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks in reinforcement learning (RL) settings. Policy Smoothing is based on the idea of randomized smoothing, where noise is added to the inputs of a model. Specifically, Gaussian noise is added to the observation input of the RL policy at each timestep before passing it through the policy to select an action. The key theoretical result enabling the robustness guarantee is an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma proven by the authors. This lemma allows them to bound the probability that the total accumulated reward over an episode will be above a threshold even under an adversarial attack, by relating it to the probability of exceeding that reward with just the smoothing noise added. The smoothing noise makes the action stochastic, so the actions followed at individual timesteps are not necessarily robust, but a lower bound on the total reward over the entire episode can still be guaranteed. Experiments in environments like Cartpole, Pong and Mountain Car demonstrate that Policy Smoothing can provide non-trivial robustness certificates in practice.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of achieving provable adversarial robustness in reinforcement learning (RL) against norm-bounded perturbations of the agent's observations. Specifically, it focuses on developing a defense procedure based on randomized smoothing that can provide robustness certificates without making restrictive assumptions about the RL environment or the agent's policy.

The key challenge is that standard randomized smoothing techniques developed for static supervised learning problems like image classification do not directly apply to RL due to the adaptive nature of the adversary. In RL, the perturbation at each timestep can depend on previous states, actions, and observations. So the paper develops new theoretical results to adapt randomized smoothing to the dynamic RL setting.

The main contributions are:

- Proving an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to characterize worst-case perturbations in the RL setting. This allows deriving robustness certificates for the total reward of an episode.

- Proposing a policy smoothing technique that adds Gaussian noise to the policy's observations at each timestep. The paper shows this can provide guarantees on the total reward under attack.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of policy smoothing on RL benchmark tasks like Cartpole, Pong, and Mountain Car. The certificates are shown to be non-vacuous.

In summary, the key focus is on developing theoretically-grounded randomized smoothing defenses for RL that can provide meaningful robustness guarantees without restrictive assumptions, overcoming challenges posed by the adaptivity of RL adversaries.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper presents a method to provide provable robustness guarantees for reinforcement learning (RL) agents against adversarial attacks. The key idea is to apply randomized smoothing, which has been effective for certifying classifiers, to RL policies. The authors prove a novel adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to handle the sequential and interactive nature of RL environments and derive a theoretical guarantee on the total reward of a smoothed RL policy. They propose adding Gaussian noise to the policy's observations at each timestep, which allows certifying the total episodic reward while allowing intermediate actions to potentially change under attack.

The proposed "policy smoothing" technique is model-agnostic and can be applied to any RL agent without changing the policy architecture. Empirical evaluations on Atari games and control environments demonstrate the approach can provide non-trivial certified lower bounds on expected total reward against norm-bounded attacks. The method is the first to certify episodic reward in RL and can defend against adaptive attacks that focus perturbation budget on critical timesteps.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can constrained DFT be adapted to provide a robust and reliable approach for calculating excitation energies in large supramolecular systems? 

The key points I gathered are:

- Calculating excitation energies for large systems is challenging. Existing methods like TDDFT are too computationally demanding, while ΔSCF and standard CDFT have limitations. 

- The authors introduce a new "transition-based" CDFT (T-CDFT) where the constraint corresponds to specific transitions between occupied and virtual orbitals.

- They benchmark T-CDFT against TDDFT and ΔSCF for calculating singlet and triplet excitation energies of some model systems, including acenes and OLED emitters. 

- T-CDFT performs well across the board, providing accurate excitation energies for both local excitations (in acenes) and charge-transfer states (in OLEDs), unlike TDDFT which underestimates CT energies.

- T-CDFT is also more robust and cheaper than TDDFT. Importantly, it's implemented in a linear-scaling DFT code suitable for large systems.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that T-CDFT can provide a robust method for modeling excitations in large supramolecular systems, overcoming limitations of existing methods. The results support this claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Introduction of a new variation of constrained DFT (T-CDFT) where the constraint corresponds to a specific electronic transition rather than a spatial region. 

2. Implementation of T-CDFT in the linear-scaling BigDFT code, making it suitable for large systems.

3. Benchmarking T-CDFT for calculating singlet and triplet excitation energies of acene and OLED molecules against higher-level methods. 

4. Demonstrating that T-CDFT can reliably treat both local excitations (acenes) and charge-transfer states (OLEDs) using a semi-local functional (PBE), unlike TDDFT which fails for CT states.

5. Showing the potential of using T-CDFT in BigDFT to impose constraints on a per-fragment basis to study excitations in large supramolecular systems, taking advantage of linear-scaling.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the development and benchmarking of T-CDFT as a new DFT-based method for modeling excitations that can be applied to large systems at a lower computational cost than TDDFT. A key result is that T-CDFT maintains accuracy for both local and CT excitations with a semilocal functional.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on excited state calculations:

- It introduces a new variant of constrained DFT (T-CDFT) for calculating excitation energies, building on prior CDFT methods. Other recent CDFT variants like XCDFT and XDFT have shown similar accuracy to TDDFT, so this work extends that approach.

- The key novelty is defining the constraint as a specific transition between occupied and virtual orbitals rather than a spatial region. This makes T-CDFT flexible for treating both local and charge transfer excitations. 

- The paper shows T-CDFT performs well compared to ΔSCF and TDDFT with the PBE functional for both local excitations in acenes and charge transfer states in OLED molecules. This is notable since TDDFT-PBE typically fails for CT states.

- Implementing T-CDFT in the BigDFT code enables application to large systems, which is not feasible for higher level methods like CCSD(T). This allows study of environmental effects on excitations.

- Overall, a key advantage compared to other DFT excitation methods is the combination of reasonable accuracy, applicability to both local and CT states, low computational cost, and scalability to large systems. This makes T-CDFT well suited for studying excitations in complex realistic systems.

In summary, this work extends CDFT approaches for excited states to enable robust, low-cost treatment of both local and CT excitations in large molecular systems, overcoming some limitations of other DFT methods. The implementation in BigDFT is a key advantage for future applications to complex morphologies and environments.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying T-CDFT to study excitations in realistic morphologies and environments. The authors note that a major motivation for developing T-CDFT is to enable modeling of excitation energies in large, complex systems like those found in OLED materials. They suggest using the fragmentation capabilities of BigDFT to impose excitations on individual fragments/molecules within a larger supramolecular system. This could help understand environmental effects on excitations.

- Using T-CDFT to calculate singlet-triplet energy splittings (ΔEST) in OLED emitters. The authors highlight that accurately modeling ΔEST is crucial for designing optimal TADF emitters, and suggest T-CDFT could provide a robust approach for this.

- Extending T-CDFT to model inter-fragment charge transfer excitations. The authors propose imposing constraints between orbitals on different molecular fragments to describe excitations that are delocalized across multiple moieties.

- Applying T-CDFT with other functionals besides PBE. The implementation currently uses PBE but could be extended to hybrid functionals to further improve accuracy.

- Exploring mixed excitations beyond the HOMO-LUMO transitions. The authors show T-CDFT can incorporate minor contributions from deeper orbitals, and suggest this may be important for certain excitations.

- Comparing T-CDFT to other approaches like delta-SCF and TDDFT for larger, more diverse set of molecules. Expanding the benchmark studies would further demonstrate the reliability of T-CDFT.

In summary, the main future direction envisioned is applying T-CDFT to model excitations in large, realistic systems to understand environmental effects. The authors also suggest several ways to extend and improve upon the current methodology.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new variant of constrained DFT (T-CDFT) for calculating excitation energies in large molecular systems. In T-CDFT, the constraint is defined as a transition or combination of transitions between occupied and virtual orbitals, rather than constraining charge to a region of space as in traditional CDFT. The approach is implemented in the linear-scaling BigDFT code and applied to calculate singlet and triplet excitation energies for a set of acene molecules and OLED emitters. Compared to ΔSCF and TDDFT results, T-CDFT with the PBE functional performs equally well or better for both the local excitations in acenes and the charge transfer states in OLEDs. Since T-CDFT has lower computational cost than TDDFT and is compatible with fragmentation approaches in BigDFT, it is well-suited for studying environmental effects on excitations in large supramolecular systems. Overall, T-CDFT provides a robust method for modeling both local and charge transfer excitations in large systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new variation of constrained DFT (CDFT) called transition-based CDFT (T-CDFT) for calculating excitation energies in large supramolecular systems. In T-CDFT, the constraint is defined as a transition or combination of transitions between specific occupied and virtual orbitals, rather than constraining charge to a region of space as in traditional CDFT. The method is implemented in the BigDFT code, which uses wavelets and pseudopotentials to achieve linear-scaling computational cost. 

The authors benchmark T-CDFT for calculating singlet and triplet excitation energies of acene molecules and OLED emitters, comparing to higher-level calculations from the literature. They find T-CDFT performs equally well for local excitations in acenes and charge-transfer states in OLEDs, unlike TDDFT which underestimates charge-transfer energies with semi-local functionals. T-CDFT also outperforms ΔSCF and approaches TDDFT accuracy at much lower cost. The authors conclude T-CDFT is well-suited for modeling excitations in large supramolecular systems, where it can impose constraints on individual molecules in an environment. This will enable studying environmental effects on excitations for applications like TADF-based OLEDs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new variation of constrained DFT (CDFT) called transition-based CDFT (T-CDFT), where the constraint corresponds to a specific transition or combination of transitions between occupied and virtual orbitals, rather than constraining charge to a region of space as in traditional CDFT. The transition operator is defined based on the linear response formalism, taking inspiration from an optical excitation term, and allows imposing excitations corresponding to particular orbitals. Both pure transitions involving only the HOMO and LUMO, and mixed transitions including multiple orbitals can be treated. T-CDFT is implemented in the BigDFT code, which uses a wavelet basis set, and the method can leverage BigDFT's linear scaling approaches to treat large systems. The authors apply T-CDFT to calculate singlet and triplet excitation energies for a set of acene and OLED molecules, comparing the results to higher-level theories and demonstrating that T-CDFT performs well for both local and charge-transfer excitations, while being more robust and lower cost than TDDFT. The implementation in BigDFT also makes T-CDFT well-suited to modeling environmental effects on excitations in large realistic systems.

- Current methods like time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) are accurate but limited by computational cost. Constrained DFT (CDFT) is cheaper but works best when the spatial nature of the excitation is known. 

- In T-CDFT, the constraint is defined by particular transitions between occupied and virtual orbitals rather than a region of space. This makes it applicable to both local excitations and charge transfer states.

- They implement T-CDFT in the BigDFT code and test it on acenes and OLED emitters. Compared to TDDFT and ΔSCF, T-CDFT gives good accuracy for both local excitations in acenes and charge transfer states in OLEDs.

- A key motivation is using T-CDFT to study excitations in large realistic systems like OLED materials, where effects of molecular conformations and environments are important. The low cost and robustness of T-CDFT makes this feasible compared to other methods.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph for the paper:

This paper introduces a new variation of constrained density functional theory (CDFT) called transition-based CDFT (T-CDFT) for calculating excitation energies in molecular systems. In T-CDFT, the constraint is defined as a transition between particular occupied and virtual orbitals, rather than constraining charge to a spatial region as in traditional CDFT. The approach is implemented in the linear-scaling BigDFT code and benchmarked on calculating singlet and triplet excitation energies for acene molecules and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) emitter molecules. Compared to time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) and ΔSCF methods, T-CDFT with the PBE functional performs well for both the local excitations in acenes and charge-transfer states in OLEDs, while also being more robust and lower cost than TDDFT. The compatibility with linear-scaling BigDFT means T-CDFT can treat large systems, making it well-suited for modeling excitations in realistic environments and supramolecular morphologies like those found in OLED materials. Overall, T-CDFT provides an accurate and efficient approach for treating both local and charge-transfer excitations in large molecular systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper introduces a new variation of constrained DFT (T-CDFT) for calculating excitation energies in molecular systems. In T-CDFT, the constraint is defined as a transition between particular occupied and virtual orbitals, rather than constraining charge to a region of space as in traditional CDFT. This transition constraint is inspired by the optical excitation term from linear response theory. The method is implemented in the BigDFT code and applied to calculate singlet and triplet excitation energies for a set of acene molecules and OLED emitters. Compared to reference calculations, T-CDFT with the PBE functional performs equally well or better than ΔSCF and TDDFT with the same functional for both the local excitations in acenes and charge transfer states in OLEDs. Unlike TDDFT, the accuracy of T-CDFT is not affected by the nature of the excitation. The low computational cost compared to TDDFT, implementation in a linear-scaling code, and ability to treat both local and charge transfer excitations, make T-CDFT well-suited for modeling excitations in large realistic systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new variation of constrained DFT (T-CDFT) where the constraint is defined as a transition between particular occupied and virtual orbitals. How does this differ from traditional CDFT where the constraint is a region of space? What are the potential advantages of using an orbital-based constraint?

2. For mixed transitions, the paper uses a decomposition into individual orbital transitions. How is the contribution of each transition determined? Could an alternative breakdown based on Boys or Edmiston-Ruedenberg localization be used?

3. The paper implements T-CDFT in the BigDFT code. What aspects of BigDFT (e.g. wavelet basis, fragment approaches) make it well-suited for this method? How does the support function approach aid in imposing the orbital constraints?

4. The results show T-CDFT performs well for both local and charge transfer excitations. Why does T-CDFT not suffer from issues like TDDFT for CT states? Does the constraint help account for self-interaction errors?

5. How does the computational cost of T-CDFT compare to TDDFT and other approaches? What system sizes could be treated with T-CDFT on current hardware? Could linear-scaling algorithms extend this further?

6. For modelling TADF systems, what benefits does T-CDFT provide over other methods? How could T-CDFT be used to study excitations in realistic morphologies?

7. The transition purity indicator P is introduced to quantify mixing of transitions. How does this relate to common diagnostics like the Λ index? When is mixing important to include?

8. The paper focuses on vertical excitations, how could T-CDFT be adapted for adiabatic excitations? Could constraints based on geometry optimizations be employed?

9. The results show T-CDFT can overcome issues like convergence on local minima in ΔSCF. Why does constraining transitions avoid these problems? Are there any other benefits?

10. How transferable is the approach across functionals, e.g. could hybrid functionals be used? Would a different basis set improve results or change the comparison with other methods?
