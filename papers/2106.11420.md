# [Policy Smoothing for Provably Robust Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11420)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Can randomized smoothing techniques be adapted to provide provable robustness guarantees for reinforcement learning policies against adversarial attacks?

The key contributions towards addressing this question appear to be:

1) Proving an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma that allows deriving robustness guarantees for sequential decision making processes like RL where the adversary can adapt based on previous observations. 

2) Proposing a policy smoothing technique that adds Gaussian noise to the policy's inputs at each timestep, and showing theoretically that this allows certifying the total episodic reward against adversarial attacks.

3) Demonstrating the approach empirically on RL environments like Cartpole, Pong, Freeway and Mountain Car, and showing it can provide non-trivial robustness certificates.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that randomized smoothing can be extended to provide provable robustness for RL, which the authors address through theoretical analysis and empirical demonstrations. The key novelty is adapting the theory and techniques to handle the sequential adaptive nature of RL environments and adversaries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a defense procedure called Policy Smoothing for making reinforcement learning (RL) policies provably robust against adversarial attacks. Policy Smoothing involves adding Gaussian noise to the policy's observations before passing them through the policy network. 

2. It proves an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to generate robustness certificates for policy smoothing in the RL setting. This adaptive Neyman-Pearson lemma shows that a structured adversary that uses up its entire budget in the first time step lower bounds the performance of any general adversary. 

3. Using the adaptive Neyman-Pearson lemma, it derives a robustness certificate that lower bounds the total expected reward obtained by a smoothed policy against any norm-bounded adversarial attack.

4. It shows that the robustness certificates achieved for policy smoothing are tight, meaning the bounds are the best possible unless restrictive assumptions are made about the RL environment. This is done by constructing a worst-case environment that achieves the certified bounds.

5. It demonstrates through experiments on environments like Cartpole, Pong, Freeway and Mountain Car that policy smoothing can provide meaningful robustness guarantees in practice. The lower bounds on performance exceed the actual performance of undefended policies under attack in some cases.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing policy smoothing for RL based on an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma and showing it can provide non-vacuous robustness guarantees on complex RL benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of provable robustness for deep reinforcement learning:

- Focuses on randomized smoothing defenses: This paper specifically looks at using randomized smoothing techniques like adding Gaussian noise to inputs to achieve robustness certificates. Other works have used different techniques like interval bound propagation, curvature bounds, adversarial training, etc. 

- Considers adaptive adversaries: A key contribution is accounting for adversaries that can adapt to the defense over time by observing states, actions, etc. Some prior works only consider static adversaries that don't adapt.

- Certifies total reward rather than step-wise actions: This paper provides guarantees directly on the total reward over a full episode. Many previous works focused on certifying that the action taken at each individual time step remains robust.

- Applicable to general RL settings: The proposed method and analysis does not make restrictive assumptions about the type of policy, environment dynamics, etc. It can be applied broadly to RL systems. Other techniques are sometimes tailored to specific policy classes like Deep Q-Networks.

- Provides tightness results: The paper analyzes a worst-case environment showing the certificates achieved are the best possible given the threat model. Not all prior work provides this type of tightness analysis.

- Emphasizes model-agnostic certificates: The policy smoothing technique can be applied without knowledge of the agent's policy model. Some other methods rely more heavily on properties of the policy representation.

Overall, this paper extends the progress on provable robustness to the more challenging and realistic setting of adaptive adversaries in reinforcement learning. The proposed certificates apply broadly while still remaining tight for the given threat model.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extending the proposed method to other adversaries and smoothing distributions beyond the isometric Gaussian case considered in this work. The authors suggest investigating how their procedure could be generalized for other types of attacks and smoothing distributions.

- Applying policy smoothing to the multi-agent RL setting where one of the agents acts adversarially. The authors propose using policy smoothing to make an agent's observations more robust in environments where it is interacting with other agents, some of which may behave adversarially.

- Using policy smoothing for real-world control problems with complex dynamics. The authors discuss the potential of policy smoothing to inspire new techniques for achieving robustness in dynamic real-world control tasks like robotics.

- Scaling up policy smoothing and the associated theory to large, complex RL environments. The authors note the need to demonstrate the scalability of their approach to be able to handle more complex, high-dimensional RL problems.

- Tightening the robustness certificates achieved by policy smoothing. The authors suggest further work could aim to make their certificates tighter for certain settings by making assumptions about the environment or policy.

- Exploring connections to other areas like safe RL, distributional RL, and offline RL. The authors propose investigating if ideas from policy smoothing could have implications for some of these related subfields of RL research.

In summary, the main suggestions are to extend and scale up the method to broader settings, tighten the guarantees it provides, and explore connections to other RL research directions that could benefit from the notions of policy smoothing and certifiable robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method for achieving provable robustness guarantees for reinforcement learning (RL) policies against adversarial attacks. The key idea is to apply randomized smoothing, a technique originally developed for providing certified robustness in static machine learning models like image classifiers. The paper adapts the theory behind randomized smoothing to the dynamic and adaptive setting of reinforcement learning. In particular, it proves an "adaptive" version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma that allows deriving robustness guarantees when the adversary can adapt based on past observations. 

Based on this theoretical result, the paper develops a simple technique called Policy Smoothing where Gaussian noise is added to the policy's observations at each timestep before feeding to the policy network. This allows providing certified lower bounds on the total expected reward that the policy will obtain even in the worst-case presence of a norm-bounded adversary. The guarantees apply broadly without needing to make assumptions about the policy model or environment dynamics. The analysis considers a general RL setting modeled via interactions between two abstract systems and is not limited to standard MDPs. Empirically, the method is shown to provide non-trivial robustness certificates on Atari games and control tasks. The certificates guarantee smoothed policies collect higher reward under attack than even the empirical performance of undefended policies. Overall, the paper extends the benefits of randomized smoothing based certified defenses to the complex yet widely used setting of deep reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for making reinforcement learning agents provably robust against adversarial attacks on their observations. Reinforcement learning agents are vulnerable to attacks where small perturbations are added to their observations to degrade their performance. Prior defense methods certify robustness by requiring the policy's action to remain unchanged at every timestep. However, this approach fails if the action changes even at one timestep. The key insight of this paper is that directly certifying the total cumulative reward, without requiring robustness at every timestep, provides a more meaningful notion of robustness. 

The main contribution is an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to handle the sequential and adaptive nature of attacks in reinforcement learning. This allows deriving robustness certificates for "policy smoothing", where Gaussian noise is added to the agent's observations before feeding into the policy. The certificates lower bound the total expected reward under any norm-bounded attack, even if actions at intermediate steps may change. Experiments on Atari games and control tasks demonstrate the approach can provide non-trivial robustness guarantees. The certificates outperform the empirical robustness of undefended agents under attack in some environments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a defense method called Policy Smoothing for providing provable robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks in reinforcement learning (RL) settings. Policy Smoothing is based on the idea of randomized smoothing, where noise is added to the inputs of a model. Specifically, Gaussian noise is added to the observation input of the RL policy at each timestep before passing it through the policy to select an action. The key theoretical result enabling the robustness guarantee is an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma proven by the authors. This lemma allows them to bound the probability that the total accumulated reward over an episode will be above a threshold even under an adversarial attack, by relating it to the probability of exceeding that reward with just the smoothing noise added. The smoothing noise makes the action stochastic, so the actions followed at individual timesteps are not necessarily robust, but a lower bound on the total reward over the entire episode can still be guaranteed. Experiments in environments like Cartpole, Pong and Mountain Car demonstrate that Policy Smoothing can provide non-trivial robustness certificates in practice.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Unfortunately I cannot provide a full summary of the paper without reading it in detail. However, based on skimming the paper, it seems to be about developing a method to make reinforcement learning policies more robust to adversarial attacks. The key ideas appear to be using randomized smoothing techniques and proving a version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma that accounts for the adaptive nature of attacks in reinforcement learning. The proposed method, called policy smoothing, adds Gaussian noise to the policy's observations at each timestep to achieve provable robustness guarantees on the total reward. The theoretical results allow certificates to be generated directly on the total reward rather than requiring robustness at every intermediate timestep. Overall, this work seems to extend the theory and methods of provable robustness from static tasks like image classification to the more challenging setting of reinforcement learning. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the paper in more detail.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of achieving provable adversarial robustness in reinforcement learning (RL) against norm-bounded perturbations of the agent's observations. Specifically, it focuses on developing a defense procedure based on randomized smoothing that can provide robustness certificates without making restrictive assumptions about the RL environment or the agent's policy.

The key challenge is that standard randomized smoothing techniques developed for static supervised learning problems like image classification do not directly apply to RL due to the adaptive nature of the adversary. In RL, the perturbation at each timestep can depend on previous states, actions, and observations. So the paper develops new theoretical results to adapt randomized smoothing to the dynamic RL setting.

The main contributions are:

- Proving an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to characterize worst-case perturbations in the RL setting. This allows deriving robustness certificates for the total reward of an episode.

- Proposing a policy smoothing technique that adds Gaussian noise to the policy's observations at each timestep. The paper shows this can provide guarantees on the total reward under attack.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of policy smoothing on RL benchmark tasks like Cartpole, Pong, and Mountain Car. The certificates are shown to be non-vacuous.

In summary, the key focus is on developing theoretically-grounded randomized smoothing defenses for RL that can provide meaningful robustness guarantees without restrictive assumptions, overcoming challenges posed by the adaptivity of RL adversaries.
