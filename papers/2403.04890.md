# [Few shot chain-of-thought driven reasoning to prompt LLMs for open ended   medical question answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing medical QA datasets like MedQA are multiple choice questions and not practical for real-world patient query systems. 
- Prompting strategies like Codex follow eliminative reasoning by seeing options first rather than incremental diagnostic reasoning done by clinicians.

Proposed Solution:
- Modified MedQA questions to open-ended descriptive format (MedQA-No-Opt) to mimic real clinical scenarios.  
- Proposed a new prompting strategy called MedCodex that follows clinician's step-by-step diagnostic reasoning rather than eliminative reasoning. 
- Developed a novel reward training based verifier to verify quality of reasoning and select the best response.

Key Contributions:
- Converted multiple choice MedQA dataset to open-ended descriptive questions (MedQA-No-Opt).
- Showed MedCodex prompting performs better than Codex prompting for open-ended questions.
- Created a medical QA dataset with human verified subjective responses for MedQA questions.
- Demonstrated a trained verifier improves performance by identifying good reasoning.

In summary, the paper presents a more practical medical QA dataset, a new prompting strategy to mimic clinician diagnostic reasoning, and a verification technique to improve answer quality. The key idea is incremental diagnostic reasoning and verification are essential for real-world medical question answering systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a modified MedQA dataset and chain-of-thought reasoning prompts to generate more practical, open-ended medical question responses from language models, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods through human evaluations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a healthcare-specific language model response generation task that utilizes the best prompting methods. Specifically, the authors propose an "incremental reasoning chain of thought prompting" strategy that follows the usual clinical approach to reach a diagnosis. 

2. Demonstrating that the incremental reasoning prompting strategy performs significantly better at answering open-ended medical questions compared to the Codex prompting strategy from prior work.

3. Presenting efforts towards building a novel medical corpus that includes human-evaluated/verified subjective responses generated from a language model on the MedQA dataset. 

4. Contributing a modified version of the MedQA dataset more conducive to testing medical question answering abilities without multiple choice options provided.

5. Developing a "verifier" trained on human expert assessments that can better select high quality responses when provided with different generated response options.

In summary, the key innovation is in tailoring prompting strategies to emulate real-world medical decision making, which enables better performance on open-ended question answering. The human verification efforts also aim to produce more reliable language model outputs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Medical question answering 
- Prompt engineering
- Chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning
- MedQA dataset
- Objective vs subjective responses
- Forward reasoning vs eliminative reasoning
- Descriptive questions
- Differential diagnosis 
- Human evaluation
- Reward training
- Verifier model

The paper explores using large language models for medical question answering, and compares different prompting strategies like codex prompting and medcodex prompting. It introduces modifications to the MedQA dataset to create more open-ended, real-world style medical questions. Key concepts include chain-of-thought reasoning approaches, generating differential diagnoses, and training a separate verifier model to select high quality responses. There is a focus on human evaluation by medical experts at various stages. The overall goal is developing prompting strategies that can elicit detailed, logical reasoning from LLMs to answer complex medical questions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the incremental reasoning prompt proposed in this paper differ from existing Chain of Thought (COT) prompting strategies like the Codex prompt? What are the key advantages it offers over eliminative reasoning approaches?

2. The paper proposes converting multiple choice questions in the MedQA dataset to open-ended questions to better emulate real clinical scenarios. What modifications were made to the questions and what role did clinical experts play in this conversion process?  

3. The paper evaluates prompting strategies on both the original multiple choice MedQA dataset and the modified open-ended version. What differences did the authors observe in the relative performance of Codex and MedCodex prompting between these two datasets? What reasons are provided to explain this?

4. How exactly is the MedCodex prompt designed to mimic the typical reasoning process and flow of differential diagnosis used by clinicians? What aspects of clinical practice does it aim to model?

5. The paper finds that MedCodex prompting performs significantly better on open-ended questions for the smaller Llama2-7B model but that Codex prompting works better for leveraging the larger Llama2-70B model. What explanations are provided for this difference?

6. Describe in detail the process used for training the verifier model using expert annotated data. What was the annotation process? What types of response pairs were used and why?  

7. Explain the loss function and training process used for fine-tuning the Llama2 model into a reward model for the verifier. Why was the margin parameter set to 0?

8. How exactly does the verifier module work when selecting among multiple differential diagnosis options generated using MedCodex prompting? What inputs are provided to it?

9. The verifier was only tested on the smaller Llama2-7B model due to resource constraints. What potential benefits are hypothesized if it was tested on larger models? What might the limitations still be?

10. The paper only tests the methods on the Llama2 model series. What are some key next steps proposed to establish the generalizability of the overall approach across other large language models? What barriers exist to applying this method more widely at present?
