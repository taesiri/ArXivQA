# [Who's Thinking? A Push for Human-Centered Evaluation of LLMs using the   XAI Playbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06223)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop more human-centered evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) by drawing inspiration from the field of explainable AI (XAI)? 

The key points are:

- There is a lack of human-centered evaluation for LLMs compared to the more mature field of XAI.

- LLMs and XAI share some similarities as AI systems meant to aid downstream human decision making, with no singular ground truth metric. 

- The paper argues three areas of human-centered XAI evaluation should be explored for LLMs: understanding user mental models, evaluating utility for specific use cases via user studies, and measuring cognitive engagement.

- Applying lessons from XAI research to LLMs will allow better evaluation focused on how LLMs meet real human needs and cognitive tendencies.

So in summary, the main research goal is to propose transferring human-centered evaluation techniques from XAI to LLMs to better measure real-world utility and interaction effects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

The paper argues for the importance of human-centered evaluation of large language models (LLMs), drawing parallels with the field of explainable AI (XAI). Specifically, it highlights three areas that should be explored for human-centered LLM evaluation:

1. Mental models - Understanding the mental models that everyday users hold about how LLMs work. This is important because mismatches between users' mental models and the true capabilities/limitations of LLMs can lead to issues like overtrust.

2. Use case utility - Evaluating the real-world usefulness of LLMs for specific tasks/use cases through user studies. Even if LLMs seem impressive, they may not actually improve performance on downstream tasks. 

3. Cognitive engagement - Studying how cognitively engaged users are with LLM outputs, and how this level of engagement affects their behavior and tendency for errors. Superficial reviews of LLM outputs could lead to issues like not catching inappropriate content.

Overall, the key contribution is advocating for more research on how actual humans interact with and use LLM systems, highlighting potential areas of concern borrowed from research in XAI and human-computer interaction. The end goal is to promote more human-centered evaluation of LLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper argues for applying learnings from human-centered evaluation of explainable AI systems, which consider mental models, use case utility, and cognitive engagement, to evaluating large language models to ensure they meet real human needs and avoid dangers of overreliance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper provides a helpful overview of human-centered evaluation approaches for AI systems, with a particular focus on large language models (LLMs). It draws connections between evaluation methods for explainable AI (XAI) systems and potential evaluation approaches for LLMs. 

- In contrast to papers that focus only on quantitative metrics or technical benchmarks for LLMs, this paper argues for the importance of qualitative and human-centric evaluations. The emphasis on mental models, real-world utility, and cognitive engagement aligns with recent calls in the field for more holistic, socially-aware, and ethics-focused evaluation paradigms.

- The paper situates itself firmly within the growing literature that advocates going beyond accuracy metrics and considering the sociotechnical context of AI systems. However, rather than providing an extensive new framework, it offers more of an informed commentary piece that connects XAI and LLM evaluation.

- The three areas highlighted - mental models, use cases, and cognitive engagement - reflect established human-centered evaluation approaches in HCI and XAI. This paper does a nice job relating these to the emerging issue of responsible LLM evaluation. However, references to previous scholarship on things like mental models could be strengthened.

- Compared to technical benchmarking studies or papers focused on ethics/values tensions, this paper's contribution rests more in synthesis and translation - bringing lessons from XAI into conversation with LLM evaluation. It combines a helpful primer on both topics with insightful analysis of their connections.

In summary, this is a thoughtful conceptual paper that relates existing human-centered evaluation scholarship to the current challenges around effectively and responsibly assessing large language models. It provides a nice framing of the issues and conversation starter for this important research area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest three main future research directions:

1. Seek to understand the mental models of LLMs that everyday users hold. The authors argue we cannot assume everyone understands how LLMs work the same way ML experts do. Research should explore how the general public conceptualizes and believes LLMs function, as mismatches between users' mental models and how LLMs actually work can be dangerous.

2. Evaluate the utility of LLMs via use case based user studies. The authors suggest researching whether LLMs actually help or hurt task performance in real-world use cases through user studies, rather than assuming they will be helpful. They suggest identifying specific use cases, then designing and evaluating LLMs for those contexts.  

3. Document how cognitively engaged users are with LLM outputs, and how engagement affects user and system behavior. The authors argue research should explore whether users actually verify LLM outputs for correctness, or just trust them blindly. This could reveal issues like overreliance on potentially faulty LLM outputs. Strategies like "cognitive forcing" may help increase user verification. Overall, consequences of offloading cognitive work to LLMs need more research.

In summary, the authors want more human-centered LLM research on users' mental models, real-world utility via use cases, and effects of cognitive engagement/offloading. Their goal is kickstarting research on how LLMs meet human needs and interact with human cognition.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper discusses human-centered evaluation of large language models (LLMs). It first provides background on explainable AI (XAI) and current evaluation strategies which combine quantitative metrics and qualitative human input. The paper then gives an overview of LLMs, describing how they have grown rapidly in scale and performance. It notes that current LLM evaluations focus on metrics like accuracy and fairness but lack a human-centered perspective. 

The paper argues that lessons from XAI evaluation should be applied to LLMs. It highlights three important areas of focus: understanding users' mental models of how LLMs work, evaluating if LLMs are actually helpful for real-world use cases via user studies, and assessing how cognitively engaged users are with LLM outputs. More human-centered evaluation is needed to understand how LLMs meet human needs and to evaluate issues like trust, utility, and cognitive biases in interacting with LLM outputs. The paper concludes by arguing these issues must be addressed given the potential scale of LLM integration into daily life.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the need for more human-centered evaluation of large language models (LLMs). 

- It argues that current evaluation methods for LLMs focus on quantitative metrics and potential harms/failures, but don't sufficiently consider how these models impact and interact with human cognition and decision-making.

- The paper draws parallels between LLMs and the field of explainable AI (XAI), which has devoted more effort to human-centered evaluation. 

- It highlights three important areas that should be explored for human-centered evaluation of LLMs: mental models (how users conceptualize the technology), use case utility (whether the technology is actually helpful for real-world tasks), and cognitive engagement (how deeply users interact with and verify the outputs).

- The goal is to encourage more research on these human-centric aspects of LLMs, before they become even more widespread, to understand their real-world impacts and ensure they align with human needs and capabilities.

In summary, the key problem is the lack of human-centered perspective in current LLM evaluation, and the paper argues XAI research provides a model for bringing more human considerations like cognition and decision-making into the mix when assessing these increasingly powerful AI systems.
