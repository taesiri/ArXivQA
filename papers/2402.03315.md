# [RTHDet: Rotate Table Area and Head Detection in images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional models focus on detecting horizontal tables and cannot accurately detect rotated tables or locate their head/tail parts. This limits downstream table recognition tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce new task of detecting rotated tables and localizing their heads/tails.
- Propose TRR360D dataset using Adaptively Bounded Rotation on ICDAR2019MTD to generate rotated tables with head/tail annotations.  
- Propose R360 AP metric to evaluate rotated box detection and head/tail localization accuracy.
- Develop RTHDet model by adding Angle Loss (AL) branch to RTMDet-S to enable learning 360° rotation features to locate heads/tails. Further improve RTHDet via transfer learning and adaptive boundary rotation data augmentation.

Key Contributions:
- TRR360D dataset containing 840 images with 1446 rotated box annotations of tables with head/tail labels.
- R360 AP metric that incorporates angle constraints to assess rotating region detection and head/tail localization accuracy.
- RTHDet model that builds on RTMDet-S and adds AL branch to support 360° rotation learning. Improves AP50(T<90) from 23.7% to 88.7% compared to RTMDet-S baseline.

In summary, this paper introduced a new task, dataset, evaluation metric and method to advance the state-of-the-art in detecting rotated tables and localizing their head/tail parts. The high performance of RTHDet model demonstrates efficacy of proposed solutions. This research facilitates downstream table recognition applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new task of detecting rotated table regions and localizing their head and tail parts, along with corresponding datasets, evaluation metrics, and methods to address limitations of prior work that focused only on horizontal table detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions in proposing the new task of detecting rotated table regions and localizing their head and tail parts are:

1. TRR360D Dataset: The paper introduces a novel dataset generation method called Adaptively Bounded Rotation to create the TRR360D rotated table detection dataset with 1446 rotated box annotations and semantic information about table heads and tails. 

2. R360 AP Evaluation Metric: The paper proposes the R360 AP metric to evaluate the performance of both rotating table region detection and head-tail localization accuracy, overcoming limitations of the regular AP metric.

3. RTHDet Model: The paper proposes the RTHDet model that builds on the RTMDet-S baseline and introduces the $D_{r360}$ rotation rectangle angle representation and Angle Loss (AL) branch to enable detecting rotating table regions and precisely localizing their heads and tails. Experiments show RTHDet significantly improves performance over the baseline.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing the task itself, the TRR360D dataset, R360 AP metric, and RTHDet model to push forward research on detecting rotated tables and localizing their semantic head and tail parts.
