# [HIMap: HybrId Representation Learning for End-to-end Vectorized HD Map   Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Constructing accurate vectorized HD maps is important for autonomous driving, where a map consists of map elements represented by points. 
- Existing methods using point-level representations have limitations in learning element-level information, leading to issues like inaccurate element shapes or entanglement between elements.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a HybrId framework (HIMap) for end-to-end vectorized HD map construction based on hybrid representation learning.
- Introduce a hybrid representation called HIQuery to represent all map elements, consisting of a point query (point information) and element query (element information).
- Design a point-element interactor to interactively extract and encode both point and element level information into the HIQuery. This enables mutual refinement of local point positions and overall element shapes.
- Add a point-element consistency constraint to enhance information consistency within an element and distinguishability between elements.

Main Contributions:
- Propose HIMap framework for vectorized HD map construction using hybrid representation learning of points and elements.
- Introduce point-element interactor for interactive extraction and encoding of hybrid information.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes (77.8 mAP) and Argoverse2 (72.7 mAP) datasets, improving over previous best by 8.3 and 2.2 mAP respectively.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel hybrid representation and interactive learning framework for improving vectorized HD map construction, where both local point positions and overall element shapes are mutually refined. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets.
