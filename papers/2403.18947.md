# [Self-Supervised Interpretable Sensorimotor Learning via Latent   Functional Modularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18947)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing end-to-end networks for autonomous driving often lack interpretability and transparency in their decision-making processes. They also require additional task-level supervision to handle multiple driving scenarios. These limitations reduce reliability and trustworthiness when deployed in the real world. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MoNet, a modular end-to-end network with inherent functional modularity inspired by the human brain. MoNet contains three neural modules - Perception, Planning, and Control - that are functionally segregated but structurally connected. 

1) A novel cognition-guided contrastive (CGC) loss leverages inter-modular relationships to enhance task-specificity of latent decisions without task-level supervision. 

2) An interpretable method using spatial attention maps and decoded probability scores provides insights into perceptual and behavioral processes during end-to-end inference.

Main Contributions:
1) Modular end-to-end network architecture for interpretable sensorimotor learning without full supervision.

2) Cognition-guided contrastive loss to promote emergence of task-relevant decision-making. 

3) Integration of spatial attention and decoded decisions to interpret perception and behavior.

4) Demonstration of enhanced sensorimotor performance and interpretability in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

The proposed MoNet architecture and methods aim to enhance the transparency, reliability and trustworthiness of end-to-end models by incorporating explainable artificial intelligence into robotic learning. Experiments highlight the effectiveness and practical benefits of this approach.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a modular end-to-end network architecture with three distinct modules - perception, planning, and control. What is the motivation behind adopting such a modular architecture instead of a monolithic end-to-end model? How does it help with interpretability?
