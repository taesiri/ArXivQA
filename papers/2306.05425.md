# MIMIC-IT: Multi-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we develop a large-scale multimodal dataset and model that enhances the interactive capabilities and generalization abilities of vision-language models?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A large-scale multimodal dataset with diverse instructions and conversational context can empower vision-language models with stronger interactive and generalizable skills. 2) An automatic pipeline combining human expertise and AI capabilities can efficiently generate high-quality multimodal instructions at scale.3) Training a vision-language model on such a dataset can endow it with exceptional proficiency in multimodal perception, reasoning, and in-context learning.The research contributes a new multimodal instruction tuning dataset called MIMIC-IT, an automated data collection pipeline named Syphus, and a model called Otter trained on MIMIC-IT. Through empirical evaluation, the paper aims to validate the ability of MIMIC-IT and Otter to enhance vision-language models for interactive tasks.
