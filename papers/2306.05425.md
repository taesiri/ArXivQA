# MIMIC-IT: Multi-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we develop a large-scale multimodal dataset and model that enhances the interactive capabilities and generalization abilities of vision-language models?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A large-scale multimodal dataset with diverse instructions and conversational context can empower vision-language models with stronger interactive and generalizable skills. 2) An automatic pipeline combining human expertise and AI capabilities can efficiently generate high-quality multimodal instructions at scale.3) Training a vision-language model on such a dataset can endow it with exceptional proficiency in multimodal perception, reasoning, and in-context learning.The research contributes a new multimodal instruction tuning dataset called MIMIC-IT, an automated data collection pipeline named Syphus, and a model called Otter trained on MIMIC-IT. Through empirical evaluation, the paper aims to validate the ability of MIMIC-IT and Otter to enhance vision-language models for interactive tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be the proposal of a new dataset called MIMIC-IT (Multi-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning) for training and evaluating vision-language models. Some key aspects of the MIMIC-IT dataset include:- It contains around 2.8 million multi-modal instruction-response pairs based on images and videos spanning different datasets and scenarios. - Each instruction-response pair is accompanied by multi-modal in-context examples to provide conversational context. This is different from prior datasets that only used language context.- The instructions cover capabilities like perception, reasoning, and planning to support interactive vision-language tasks.- The dataset includes instructions translated to 7 languages beyond English.- They develop an automated pipeline called Syphus to efficiently create the instruction-response pairs using GPT-guided generation.- Using MIMIC-IT, they train a new model called Otter which demonstrates strong improvements in instruction following, generalization, and alignment over prior vision-language models.So in summary, the key contribution is the large-scale, diverse MIMIC-IT dataset for instruction tuning of vision-language models, along with empirical results showing the benefits of training models like Otter on this data. The multi-modal in-context format and automated data collection process are also notable aspects of this work.
