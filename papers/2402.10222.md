# [Autonomous Vehicle Patrolling Through Deep Reinforcement Learning:   Learning to Communicate and Cooperate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of multi-agent patrolling, where a group of agents need to continuously traverse an area to identify emerging events as early as possible. Finding an optimal patrolling strategy is challenging due to unknown environmental factors (e.g. wind, landscape) that affect agent movements, agents' constraints (e.g. limited battery life, hardware failures), and the need to coordinate multiple agents. Specifically, the paper considers three key cooperation challenges: 1) collision avoidance between agents, 2) congestion avoidance where agents block each other, and 3) negotiating which agents should visit different patrolling targets. Defining optimal coordination strategies manually is difficult due to the complexity of real-world patrolling environments.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) solution based on a reinforced inter-agent learning (RIAL) method. The key ideas are:

- Agents are trained to develop their own communication protocol and learn optimal cooperation strategies based on rewards from the environment. No predefined communication format or coordination logic needs to be manually specified. 

- A modified Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm extended to the multi-agent case is used as the learning algorithm. It incorporates RIAL to allow agents to learn communication actions that indirectly affect environmental rewards.

- The reward function evaluates agent performance based on patrolling efficiency, battery usage, and collision avoidance. Additional constraints are modeled including battery limitations, environmental uncertainties, and the ability to hot swap agents at the charging station.

- A curriculum training strategy gradually increases the patrolling complexity by adding more agents during training. This improves learning convergence for complex cooperation scenarios.

Contributions:
- A MARL approach for multi-agent patrolling that allows agents to learn their own communication protocol and coordination strategies.

- Handling complex real-world constraints including battery limitations, environmental uncertainties, hot swapping of agents, and graceful handling of failures.

- Validation in simulation showing performance gains over alternative patrolling strategies in terms of efficiency, collisions avoided, and fault tolerance.

In summary, this paper presents a novel MARL technique for multi-agent patrolling that reduces the need to manually define communication protocols or coordination logic. The solution is validated to be more robust and efficient than other patrolling strategies.
