# [STPrompt: Semantic-guided and Task-driven prompts for Effective Few-shot   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prompt-based fine-tuning of language models has shown promising results for few-shot learning, but designing effective prompts requires laborious expertise or computation. 
- Finding optimal label mappings is challenging due to the exploding search space. Most methods only use one token to represent each label, limiting diversity.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose SMPrompt which constructs prompts in three ways:
    1. Dep-prompt: Generates prompts from semantic dependency trees and POS tags to extract key task-relevant information
    2. Meta-prompt: Uses task metadata like labels, goals, etc. to help model recall related knowledge 
    3. ML-prompt: Allows multiple tokens to represent each label, enabling more expression and reducing mapping difficulty

Contributions:
- Dep-prompt gives state-of-the-art results on few-shot text classification by strengthening key input semantics
- Meta-prompt helps models fine-tune in more specialized semantic spaces using task descriptions
- ML-prompt learns more distinct information from multiple label tokens and mappings
- Overall, SMPrompt produces more interpretable, semantic prompts to better extract knowledge from language models, demonstrated by strong performance on sentiment analysis, question classification and textual entailment tasks.

In summary, the paper presents effective techniques to automatically construct high-quality prompts for few-shot learning instead of relying on manual expertise. The semantic focus and flexibility of SMPrompt probes knowledge from language models more effectively.
