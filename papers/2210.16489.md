# [STPrompt: Semantic-guided and Task-driven prompts for Effective Few-shot   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prompt-based fine-tuning of language models has shown promising results for few-shot learning, but designing effective prompts requires laborious expertise or computation. 
- Finding optimal label mappings is challenging due to the exploding search space. Most methods only use one token to represent each label, limiting diversity.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose SMPrompt which constructs prompts in three ways:
    1. Dep-prompt: Generates prompts from semantic dependency trees and POS tags to extract key task-relevant information
    2. Meta-prompt: Uses task metadata like labels, goals, etc. to help model recall related knowledge 
    3. ML-prompt: Allows multiple tokens to represent each label, enabling more expression and reducing mapping difficulty

Contributions:
- Dep-prompt gives state-of-the-art results on few-shot text classification by strengthening key input semantics
- Meta-prompt helps models fine-tune in more specialized semantic spaces using task descriptions
- ML-prompt learns more distinct information from multiple label tokens and mappings
- Overall, SMPrompt produces more interpretable, semantic prompts to better extract knowledge from language models, demonstrated by strong performance on sentiment analysis, question classification and textual entailment tasks.

In summary, the paper presents effective techniques to automatically construct high-quality prompts for few-shot learning instead of relying on manual expertise. The semantic focus and flexibility of SMPrompt probes knowledge from language models more effectively.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a semantic-driven prompt learning method called SMPrompt, which uses semantic dependency tree filters and task metadata descriptions to generate two types of augmented prompts (Dep-prompt and Meta-prompt), as well as a multi-label mapping strategy (ML-prompt), to improve performance on few-shot text classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing two augmented prompts for prompt-based learning: Dep-prompt which is generated from semantic dependency trees and POS tags, and Meta-prompt which is generated from task-specific metadata descriptions. These prompts aim to provide more instructive information to guide the language model.

2. Proposing a multi-label mapping strategy (ML-prompt) where each label is mapped to multiple tokens instead of just one. This allows more flexibility in defining the mappings and enables the model to learn more distinct information from the multiple tokens. 

3. Showing through experiments that the proposed methods (called TMPrompt) achieve state-of-the-art performance on few-shot text classification tasks. Specifically, the accuracy is improved on sentiment classification, question classification, and natural language inference tasks. 

In summary, the main contribution is proposing semantic-driven and task-specific methods to construct better prompts along with a multi-label mapping strategy, which together achieve improved performance on few-shot learning. This shows the methods can serve as effective knowledge probes for pre-trained language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Prompt learning - The paper focuses on methods for prompt-based fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. This involves using cloze-style prompts with label mappings to adapt the models for downstream tasks.

- Few-shot learning - The prompt learning methods are evaluated in few-shot settings where only a small number of labeled examples are available for fine-tuning.

- Augmented prompts - The paper proposes two strategies to create more instructive prompts: Dependency-based prompts (Dep-prompts) using semantic dependencies from the input text, and Metadata-based prompts (Meta-prompts) using task descriptions. 

- Multi-label mappings (ML-prompts) - Instead of a single label mapping token, this uses multiple tokens per label to provide more flexibility and reduce the difficulty of finding optimal label mappings.

- Semantic-driven prompts - Overall approach driven by leveraging semantic information to construct better performing prompts compared to manually defined or computationally derived prompts.

- State-of-the-art performance - The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results on few-shot text classification benchmarks including sentiment analysis, question classification, and natural language inference tasks.

In summary, the key focus is on semantic and task-aware prompt construction strategies to enable more effective prompt-based fine-tuning in few-shot settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two new prompts called Dep-prompt and Meta-prompt. What is the key idea behind generating these prompts and how do they differ? Explain the mechanisms for generating each one.

2. The paper claims that Dep-prompt and Meta-prompt help the model "find the task-related knowledge embedded in PLMs". Explain what this means and why augmenting the prompt in these semantic ways would achieve this goal. 

3. The multi-labels mapping (ML-prompt) allows multiple tokens to represent each class label instead of just one. Explain the rationale behind this and why it helps improve performance. How does the training process differ when using ML-prompt?

4. The paper finds that combining all three proposed methods (Dep-prompt, Meta-prompt, ML-prompt) does not always result in better performance than using them individually. Analyze some possible reasons for this.

5. How exactly does the model leverage dependency parses and part-of-speech tags to construct the Dep-prompt? Explain the role of the "filters" used.

6. The construction of the Meta-prompt relies heavily on manual design and background knowledge about the task. Discuss the limitations of this approach and how it could be improved.  

7. The paper explores the impact of different choices for the dependency filters used in Dep-prompt. Analyze these results and discuss which filters seem most meaningful.

8. Could the proposed methods be applied to other NLP tasks beyond text classification? Explain how you might adapt the approach for a task like machine translation.

9. The prompts are constructed assuming access to a pre-trained masked language model. Discuss how the overall approach would need to be modified if using a different model architecture.

10. The results show improved state-of-the-art results on several few-shot datasets. Critically analyze whether these gains are truly meaningful, given potential issues like overfitting to small datasets.
