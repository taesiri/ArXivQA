# [Solving Oscillation Problem in Post-Training Quantization Through a   Theoretical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11906)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:Why does the problem of loss oscillation occur in post-training quantization (PTQ) methods, how does it affect model accuracy, and how can it be solved? Specifically, the key points are:- The paper reveals an overlooked problem of loss oscillation during the reconstruction process in various PTQ methods, where the loss non-monotonically increases/decreases instead of monotonically increasing due to quantization error accumulation. - Through theoretical analysis, the paper proves that this oscillation is caused by differences in the capacities of adjacent modules in the network. - The loss oscillation results in larger reconstruction errors for certain modules, which negatively impacts overall model accuracy. The paper shows the final reconstruction error is correlated with the maximum error among previous modules.- To solve this, the paper proposes a Mixed REConstruction Granularity (MRECG) method to smooth the loss oscillation. It jointly optimizes capacities of adjacent modules with large differences, reducing the final reconstruction error.- MRECG optimizes module grouping based on capacity metrics under data-dependent and data-free scenarios. It shows consistent accuracy improvements when combined with different PTQ algorithms.In summary, the core hypothesis is that smoothing the overlooked loss oscillation issue in PTQ methods by optimizing module capacities can improve accuracy, which the paper proves both theoretically and empirically. MRECG is presented as an effective solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It reveals an oscillation problem in post-training quantization (PTQ) methods that has been overlooked before. The paper shows both theoretically and empirically that this oscillation is caused by differences in the capacities of adjacent modules. 2. To address the oscillation problem, the paper proposes a novel Mixed REConstruction Granularity (MRECG) method. This method employs either a loss metric or module capacity estimates to determine the optimal granularity for jointly optimizing modules during quantization. Smoothing out the oscillation improves final performance.3. The proposed MRECG method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results across a range of models like ResNet and MobileNet quantized to different bit-widths. For example, it improves top-1 accuracy by 4.93% on a 2/4 bit MobileNetV2 compared to prior art.4. The paper also shows that increasing batch size for the calibration data used in PTQ helps reduce the approximation error in estimating the expectation. This further boosts accuracy, though with diminishing returns.In summary, the key innovation is identifying and addressing the overlooked oscillation problem in PTQ using the proposed MRECG method. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness for various models and bit configurations.

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper reveals an oscillation problem in post-training quantization methods caused by differences in module capacity, and proposes a mixed reconstruction granularity approach to smooth out the oscillations by jointly optimizing modules with large capacity differences, leading to improved accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in post-training quantization:- The main novelty is identifying and addressing the problem of loss oscillation during PTQ optimization. Previous methods like AdaRound, BRECQ and QDrop do not explicitly consider or analyze this issue. - The authors take a principled approach to explaining the oscillation through theoretical analysis of module capacity differences. They formally define concepts like module topological homogeneity and module capacity to characterize the problem.- To address oscillation, the proposed MRECG method is intuitive - jointly optimize modules with large capacity differences. But it is the first work to systematically construct this as an optimization problem.- MRECG is model-agnostic and compatible with different PTQ algorithms like BRECQ and QDrop. Experiments show consistent gains across various models, proving its generalization.- Achieved results are state-of-the-art, especially for low bitwidth PTQ on compact models like MobileNetV2. The improvements are more significant than prior arts.- The technique of expanding batch size during calibration is also novel, and shown to provide complementary benefits during optimization.- Overall, the paper makes conceptual, theoretical and practical contributions over existing PTQ methods. The oscillation problem has not been well studied before, and this provides new insights. The proposed solutions are simple but effective.In summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in post-training quantization through a rigorous theoretical perspective and a practical optimization framework. The gains are clearly demonstrated through extensive experiments. It addresses an important problem overlooked by prior work. The approach is principled and model-agnostic. These qualities make it a valuable contribution to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Further investigating how to quantify the effects of residual inputs and number of convolution groups on module capacity in PTQ. The current analysis makes assumptions about module topological homogeneity that excludes these factors. Finding ways to account for them could further improve module capacity estimation.- Exploring if the concepts around module capacity and mixed reconstruction granularity can be applied in other compression techniques like neural architecture search and network pruning. The idea of jointly optimizing modules to smooth out losses seems potentially useful beyond just PTQ.- Testing the approach on larger-scale datasets beyond ImageNet, like video or medical image datasets. The authors validate performance on classification, but other domains may exhibit different module capacity characteristics.- Extending the theoretical analysis around module capacity differences causing loss oscillations. The current theory relies on assumptions like independence of module inputs/weights. Relaxing those could make the theory more broadly applicable.- Developing methods to automatically determine optimal hyperparameter values like the number of joint modules k, rather than manually tuning them. Some form of hyperparameter optimization could make the approach more adaptive.- Investigating whether dynamic mixed granularity during training could smooth losses and improve convergence, beyond just static PTQ. The core ideas could potentially benefit training efficiency too.In summary, the key suggestions are to broaden the theoretical analysis, explore wider applications beyond PTQ and image classification, develop ways to automatically set hyperparameters, and study if similar ideas could be integrated into training. Overall the paper presents novel insights around module capacity that seem to have significant room for further investigation.

The paper proposes a method to solve the oscillation problem in post-training quantization (PTQ) of neural networks. The key points are:- The paper reveals an overlooked oscillation problem in previous PTQ methods, where the reconstruction loss oscillates up and down during the layer-wise or block-wise reconstruction process. - It provides theoretical analysis to demonstrate the oscillation is caused by the difference in capacity of adjacent modules. A small capacity module exacerbates the cumulative quantization error while a large capacity module reduces it, leading to the oscillation.- To address the problem, the paper defines module capacity (ModCap) and proposes a Mixed Reconstruction Granularity (MRECG) method. It jointly optimizes adjacent modules with large ModCap differences, which smooths the loss oscillation and improves accuracy.- MRECG can work in data-dependent and data-free scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art results on various models, e.g. 1.52% higher accuracy on ResNet-18 with 2/4 bit quantization.In summary, the paper identifies the overlooked oscillation problem in PTQ and proposes MRECG to address it, which notably improves accuracy especially for compact models and low-bit quantization. The theoretical analysis offers insights into the issue while the proposed solutions are simple yet effective.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a method to solve the problem of loss oscillation in post-training quantization (PTQ) of neural networks. The authors first theoretically prove that the oscillation is caused by differences in the capacity of adjacent modules in the network. Modules with smaller capacity exacerbate the cumulative effect of quantization errors, rapidly increasing the loss. Modules with larger capacity can break through this cumulative effect and decrease the loss. To address this, the authors propose a mixed reconstruction granularity (MRECG) method. This identifies modules with large capacity differences and jointly optimizes them during PTQ to smooth out the oscillations. Both data-dependent and data-free versions are presented, with the former finding the global optimum through a loss metric and the latter finding a local optimum efficiently through a capacity metric. Experiments on ImageNet classification validate that MRECG eliminates oscillations and outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods. For example, with 2/4 bit ResNet-50 quantization, MRECG improves accuracy by 1.9% over the previous best method. The improvements are particularly significant for small models, with over 6% better accuracy on MobileNetV2 x0.5.In summary, this paper provides the first theoretical analysis of the overlooked oscillation problem in PTQ. It proves this is caused by differences in module capacity and proposes an effective MRECG solution to smooth out oscillations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy, especially for compact models, with the proposed approach successfully eliminating loss oscillations during PTQ.
