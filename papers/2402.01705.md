# [Beyond Behaviorist Representational Harms: A Plan for Measurement and   Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Representational harms from AI systems have been relatively neglected compared to allocative harms. Representational harms include changes in mental representations that potentially result in downstream individual or group harm. 
- Current definitions of representational harms focus too narrowly on observable behaviors, failing to account for changes in internal cognitive/affective states and dynamics.
- There is a lack of practical guidance on measuring representational harms to support mitigation and accountable system deployment.

Proposed Solutions:
- Expand the definition of representational harms beyond behaviors to include changes in options considered, stress, social perceptions, group cohesion and conflicts resulting from AI system outputs.
- Provide examples of potential measures from psychology research for different types of non-behavioral representational harms.
- Outline high-level requirements for real-world measurement like identifying relevant harms and groups, determining appropriate temporal granularity, and utilizing both active and passive measures. 
- Demonstrate measurement considerations through a case study of potential gender-related representational harms from a conversational AI system.

- Argue that seamless design and ubiquity of large language models increase risks of undetected representational harms at scale. Mitigations should increase critical reasoning (seamful design), provide alternative perspectives (counter-narratives), and implement accountability via measurement.

Main Contributions:
- A framework for expanding definitions of representational harms beyond behaviors to internal cognitive/affective changes.
- Examples of potential measures connected to different types of non-behavioral harms.  
- Practical guidance on real-world measurement considerations and requirements.
- Analysis of heightened risks from language models and proposed mitigation strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes expanding the definition of representational harms beyond just observable behaviors to include changes in mental states, outlines requirements for measuring these harms, examines the heightened susceptibility of large language models to propagating such harms, and suggests potential mitigation strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is expanding the definition of representational harms beyond just observable behaviors to also include changes in cognitive states, affective states, and emotions. The paper argues that current definitions of representational harms focus too much on downstream behavioral effects as evidence of harm, while neglecting underlying changes in mental representations that may lead to those effects. 

The paper proposes broadening the scope of representational harms to include reductions in options considered, increased stress, increased social anxiety, increased within-group and between-group conflicts, and reductions in healthy behaviors. It provides examples of each type of harm and suggests validated psychometric measures that could be used to assess them. 

The paper also outlines high-level requirements for putting these ideas into practice, including determining which harms are most relevant, selecting appropriate measurement granularity, and employing both active and passive measures. It demonstrates the feasibility of this approach through a case study of potential harms from interactions with large language models.

Overall, the main contribution is a framework for expanding the notion of representational harms beyond just observable behaviors, so they can be more comprehensively defined, measured, and potentially mitigated.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Representational harms - The main focus of the paper is on representational harms, which are defined as the less tangible harms of algorithmic systems, including effects on reputation, societal standing, and cultural harmony. 

- Behaviorist definitions - Many current definitions of representational harms focus solely on observable behaviors as evidence of harm, rather than changes in internal cognitive/emotional states.

- Expanding definitions - The authors argue for expanding definitions of representational harms beyond just behaviors to also include changes in mental representations, affective states, etc.

- Measurement - Key requirements and challenges for measuring representational harms in real-world contexts. Case study demonstrating potential harms.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Heightened susceptibility of LLMs to propagate representational harms due to seamless design and ubiquitous deployment. 

- Mitigations - Proposed mitigation strategies such as seamful design, counter-narratives, measurement for improvement/accountability. Discussion of cases where harms may be morally permissible.

Some other keywords: allocative harms, stereotypes, normative processes, embodiment, critical reasoning, option consideration, stress, social anxiety, group conflicts, polarization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes expanding the definition of representational harms beyond just observable behaviors to also include changes in cognitive and affective states. What are some of the key challenges in identifying and measuring these more subtle, internal harms compared to externally observable behaviors? 

2. The paper provides some example scales and measures for different types of representational harms (Table 2). However, many of these focus on the phenomena itself rather than the resulting harm. What are some ways the authors could improve their framework to better link specific representational changes to downstream harms?

3. The paper argues that representational harms may arise at multiple temporal and social granularities. How might the measurement methods need to differ when evaluating individual versus group-level harms over both short and long time horizons? What are some specific examples?

4. The proposed measurement methods rely heavily on surveys and self-report data. What are some ways to complement or validate these subjective measures with more objective behavioral data or physiological measurements? What disciplines could provide expertise here?

5. The case study with the soccer chatbot provides an example application of identifying potential representational harms from system outputs. What other case study domains might lend themselves well to illustrate the proposed measurement framework? Why?

6. The paper argues that qualitative input from impacted communities is essential for identifying potential harms. What are some best practices and pitfalls when incorporating participatory research methods? How could the framework better scaffold inclusion of stakeholder perspectives?  

7. The paper focuses primarily on measurement of representational harms. How might the specific mitigation strategies need to differ depending on the types of harm and the measurement results? Can you give examples?

8. The paper acknowledges cases where representational harms could be morally justified. What are some ways to determine permissible tradeoffs between different groups or types of harm from a moral philosophy perspective when making system design decisions?

9. The discussion on mitigation strategies focuses heavily on system-level interventions. What are some ways we could also look to influence or educate end users to be more critical consumers and responsible controllers of these systems?  

10. The conclusion argues that we need not be limited to just diversifying system outputs when considering mitigation strategies. Can you propose some more innovative methods aligned with this thinking that go beyond just changing the external representations?
