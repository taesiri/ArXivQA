# [Catch Missing Details: Image Reconstruction with Frequency Augmented   Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02541)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new model called Frequency Augmented VAE (FA-VAE) to improve image reconstruction quality from a discrete latent codebook space. The main research question it aims to address is:

How can we improve the reconstruction quality, especially for fine details, when using discrete latent codebook models like VQ-VAE?

The key hypothesis is that the degradation in reconstruction quality at higher compression rates is partly due to misalignment between the original and reconstructed images in the frequency domain. Specifically, higher frequencies representing fine details tend to get lost during the compression process. 

To address this, the paper proposes a new model architecture with Frequency Complement Modules (FCMs) that are designed to capture missing high frequency details and complement the decoder's features. The FCMs are guided by a new loss function called Dynamic Spectrum Loss (DSL) to focus on restoring important frequencies for each decoder layer.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by explicitly aligning the reconstructed images better in the frequency domain using FCMs guided by DSL, the model can restore finer details and improve overall reconstruction quality compared to prior VQ-VAE methods, especially at higher compression rates. Experiments on several image datasets validate this hypothesis.
