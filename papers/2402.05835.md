# [How Much is Unseen Depends Chiefly on Information About the Seen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05835)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Estimating the probability distribution of data in the presence of rare/unseen classes is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. The conventional Good-Turing (GT) estimator overestimates the probabilities of observed classes and underestimates probabilities of unobserved classes.

- Previous work has made simplifying assumptions of independence between frequencies of classes using Poisson approximation. This paper tackles the dependencies analytically without approximation.

Methodology: 
- The paper provides an exact characterization of the dependency between frequencies of different classes in the sample. This allows decomposing the expected total probability mass into components that can be estimated from frequencies in the sample and a remainder term.  

- They introduce an estimator with exponentially decaying bias by plugging in the frequencies for the terms in the decomposition. However, its variance is high.

- They formulate the estimation as an optimization problem to find representations with lower MSE. A genetic algorithm searches the space of representations to discover the estimator with minimal MSE.

Contributions:
- Precise analytical characterization of dependencies between frequencies of classes, without simplifying assumptions. Enables reasoning about properties of estimators.  

- Decomposition of expected total probability mass into sample-dependent and remainder terms. Quantifies what can and cannot be estimated from sample frequencies.

- Estimator with exponentially decaying bias, much lower than GT estimator's bias. But has high variance.  

- Methodology to discover distribution-specific estimators with lower MSE than GT by searching over representations. MSE reductions of ~20% over GT shown empirically.

In summary, the key innovation is an analytical characterization of dependencies between frequencies, which enables precise reasoning. This leads to low-bias estimators, and a strategy to discover estimators with lower MSE through search.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper shows that the expected proportion of unseen data classes depends chiefly on the frequencies $f_k$ of seen classes with the same frequency $k$, develops an estimator with exponentially decaying bias, and uses a genetic algorithm to discover estimators that substantially reduce mean squared error compared to the widely used Good-Turing estimator.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a precise characterization of the dependency between the frequencies $N_x$ of different elements $x$ in a sample from a multinomial distribution. This allows analyzing properties like the expected total probability mass $E[M_k]$ without needing to make simplifying assumptions like using the Poisson approximation.

2. Based on the dependency characterization, the paper shows exactly to what extent $E[M_k]$ can be estimated from frequencies observed in the sample versus what remains that depends on the unseen distribution $p$ and number of elements $|X|$. 

3. The paper develops a new class of estimators for $M_k$, including a minimal-bias estimator with exponentially decaying bias and a method to discover estimators with minimal MSE using a genetic algorithm.

4. Through experiments, the paper shows the minimal-bias estimator has substantially smaller bias than the widely used Good-Turing estimator, while the minimal-MSE estimators discovered by the genetic algorithm have roughly 20% smaller MSE than Good-Turing.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a better characterization and new estimators for the total probability mass $M_k$ over elements with a given frequency $k$ in a multinomial distribution sample. This has applications in estimating properties of unseen data in machine learning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that the expected missing mass $\E{M_0}$ is almost entirely determined by the expected frequencies $f_k$ of classes appearing $k$ times in the sample. Why does this make intuitive sense, and what are the implications of this finding?

2. The paper introduces a new estimator $\hat{M}_k^B$ with exponentially decaying bias. Explain the derivation of this estimator and analyze why it achieves lower bias compared to the Good-Turing estimator. 

3. The variance of the new estimator $\hat{M}_k^B$ grows with the sample size. Provide a detailed analysis of the factors influencing this variance and discuss whether this limits the applicability of the estimator in practice.

4. The paper frames the estimation of expected total mass $\E{M_k}$ as an optimization problem and proposes a genetic algorithm to search for an optimal estimator. Explain the key components of this genetic algorithm in detail.

5. Analyze the theoretical properties of the estimators discovered by the genetic algorithm. For example, can we characterize their bias and/or variance? Are there any theoretical guarantees on their performance?

6. The paper shows experimentally that the MSE of the discovered estimators is lower than that of Good-Turing by roughly 20\% on average. Provide an in-depth discussion on why this improvement is significant in practice.

7. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using a genetic algorithm versus other optimization methods for discovering the estimators. What factors influenced this design choice?

8. The discovered estimators are distribution-specific, performing best on the distribution they were optimized for. Propose methods to make the estimators more robust to different underlying distributions.  

9. The paper focuses on estimating the total and missing probability masses. Discuss how the methodology could be extended to other estimation tasks in machine learning.

10. The key innovation is in modeling the dependency between frequencies. Discuss how this dependency analysis could inspire new analyses and estimators in other problems dealing with dependent frequencies.
