# [Control Risk for Potential Misuse of Artificial Intelligence in Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06632)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper discusses the risks associated with potential misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) models in scientific research. It highlights examples of how AI models for chemical synthesis planning and toxicity prediction could be exploited to create harmful substances or circumvent regulations. To address this issue, the authors propose a system called SciGuard to control misuse risks by screening user queries and model outputs based on safety and ethics standards. They also create a benchmark called SciMT-Safety to assess the safety of AI systems in science. Through experiments, they demonstrate SciGuard's effectiveness in mitigating risks on this benchmark compared to other language models, while preserving performance on benign tests. The authors emphasize the need for responsible and ethical AI development in science to maximize benefits and minimize misuse harms. They advocate for collaboration among researchers, practitioners, policymakers and the public to ensure AI applications in science align with human values and wellbeing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper discusses the risks of misuse for artificial intelligence models in science, proposes a system called SciGuard to control these risks, and introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate the safety of AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Identifying and categorizing potential risks associated with AI models in science. The paper presents a taxonomy of risks such as proposing harmful substances, repurposing models for harmful use, bypassing regulations, etc. It also provides real-world examples from chemical science to illustrate these risks.

2. Proposing a system called SciGuard to control misuse risks for AI models in science. SciGuard acts as a mediator between users and AI models to minimize risks.

3. Developing a red-teaming benchmark dataset called \safetybench to assess the safety of different scientific AI systems. This is the first benchmark focused specifically on evaluating risks of AI misuse in science.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that SciGuard is effective in mitigating risks on the \safetybench benchmark while preserving performance on benign tests.

5. Calling for responsible and ethical use of AI in science through a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach among researchers, practitioners, policymakers and the public. The paper aims to raise awareness of the issues and spark productive discussions on ensuring safe and beneficial applications of AI models in science.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing methods and benchmarks to control risks of AI misuse in science, while advocating responsible AI development in this domain.
