# [Control Risk for Potential Misuse of Artificial Intelligence in Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06632)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper discusses the risks associated with potential misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) models in scientific research. It highlights examples of how AI models for chemical synthesis planning and toxicity prediction could be exploited to create harmful substances or circumvent regulations. To address this issue, the authors propose a system called SciGuard to control misuse risks by screening user queries and model outputs based on safety and ethics standards. They also create a benchmark called SciMT-Safety to assess the safety of AI systems in science. Through experiments, they demonstrate SciGuard's effectiveness in mitigating risks on this benchmark compared to other language models, while preserving performance on benign tests. The authors emphasize the need for responsible and ethical AI development in science to maximize benefits and minimize misuse harms. They advocate for collaboration among researchers, practitioners, policymakers and the public to ensure AI applications in science align with human values and wellbeing.
