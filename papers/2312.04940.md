# [Canaries and Whistles: Resilient Drone Communication Networks with (or   without) Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04940)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a resilient communication network between drones using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The drones contain malware that disrupt communications, requiring an active defense strategy. The authors first develop an expert system called "Canaries and Whistles" (CW) that uses explicit communication protocols enabling drones to track the status of their neighbors and mitigate attacks. They then apply proximal policy optimization (PPO), a standard deep reinforcement learning algorithm, but find it underperforms CW. To close this gap, they identify three improvements: providing observations that enable learning CW-like policies, using CW agents to provide a curriculum for gradually increasing PPO agents, and removing noise from the reward function. By combining 7 CW agents and 11 PPO agents trained with these methods, termed the "Opera" approach, they establish a new state-of-the-art benchmark for the CAGE drones environment. The results demonstrate how expert systems and deep reinforcement learning can be blended for resilient cyber-physical systems.
