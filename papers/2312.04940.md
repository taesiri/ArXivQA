# [Canaries and Whistles: Resilient Drone Communication Networks with (or   without) Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04940)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a resilient communication network between drones using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The drones contain malware that disrupt communications, requiring an active defense strategy. The authors first develop an expert system called "Canaries and Whistles" (CW) that uses explicit communication protocols enabling drones to track the status of their neighbors and mitigate attacks. They then apply proximal policy optimization (PPO), a standard deep reinforcement learning algorithm, but find it underperforms CW. To close this gap, they identify three improvements: providing observations that enable learning CW-like policies, using CW agents to provide a curriculum for gradually increasing PPO agents, and removing noise from the reward function. By combining 7 CW agents and 11 PPO agents trained with these methods, termed the "Opera" approach, they establish a new state-of-the-art benchmark for the CAGE drones environment. The results demonstrate how expert systems and deep reinforcement learning can be blended for resilient cyber-physical systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to develop decentralized autonomous strategies for maintaining bandwidth in ad-hoc drone communication networks that have been compromised by supply chain malware attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a state-of-the-art expert agent called "Canaries and Whistles" (CW) that uses an explicit communication protocol to actively mitigate malware attacks in an ad-hoc drone network. 

2) It identifies limitations of applying standard deep reinforcement learning methods like PPO to this problem, and proposes three specific improvements:
(a) Providing a more Markovian observation space
(b) Using an expert curriculum learning strategy called "Opera" 
(c) Defining a denoised reward function

3) It demonstrates how by combining the expert CW agents with learning-based PPO agents using the above improvements, the performance gap can be bridged, achieving a new state-of-the-art result in the CAGE challenge environment.

In summary, the main contribution is using ideas like explicit communication, expert curriculum learning, and reward shaping to enable deep reinforcement learning agents to learn policies that can actively defend ad-hoc communication networks against malware attacks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The Canary and Whistle (CW) protocol relies on explicit communication between drones using a 16-bit message format. What considerations went into designing this compact message structure? How might it be expanded or improved in future work?

2. The authors identify limitations in the standard observation space provided by the CybORG environment. What specific Markovian state variables were missing, and why were they essential for learning CW-like policies? 

3. The Opera curriculum learning (CL) method incrementally introduces learning agents into a population of experts. What guided the decision about when to stop increasing the number of learning agents? Could this process be automated?

4. The denoised reward function removes penalties for unroutable messages during training. What impact does this have on the learned policy, and how might it perform differently at test time as a result?

5. The distributed nature of the environment leads to partial observability for each agent. How does this impact learning, and what techniques could help mitigate this challenge?

6. The paper identifies coordinating shared situational awareness as an open problem for decentralized agents. What approaches have been explored in similar multi-agent domains, and how might they translate to the drone network resilience task?

7. The CW protocol enables cooperative behavior between agents, but assumes all blue team drones are benign. How could this method deal with adversarially compromised drones that intentionally violate the protocol?  

8. What possibilities exist for learned or emergent communication protocols that might outperform the hand-designed CW system? What challenges would need to be overcome?

9. How was the neural architecture and other training details selected for the PPO agents? What impact do these hyperparameter choices have on overall performance?

10. The environment includes a green team that generates network traffic to simulate demand. How might more complex models of traffic or communication needs impact the learned policies?
