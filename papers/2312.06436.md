# [Reward Certification for Policy Smoothed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06436)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel black-box certification methodology capable of directly establishing lower bounds on the mean cumulative reward of reinforcement learning policies subject to adversarial perturbations. The key intuition is to leverage f-divergences to measure the distance between the original and perturbed distributions over trajectories induced by the policy. This allows transforming the certification problem into a convex optimization that lower bounds expected cumulative reward. A major advantage is the ability to handle perturbations in both state and action spaces bounded in l_0, l_1 or l_2 norms. Experiments across both control and Atari environments demonstrate the approach can provide significantly tighter certified lower bounds compared to prior art. The method is versatile and advances state-of-the-art for provable robustness guarantees for deep reinforcement learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a general black-box certification method for smoothed reinforcement learning policies that can directly certify lower bounds on expected cumulative rewards under adversarial perturbations bounded by various Lp norms by formulating it as a convex optimization problem based on f-divergences between the original and perturbed state distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as:

(i) The paper proposes a novel methodology to directly certify the cumulative reward of the smoothed policy. This approach uses f-divergence to gauge the separation between the original distribution and the perturbed distribution. Subsequently, the certification bound is calculated by solving a convex optimisation problem. 

(ii) The proposed method is capable of handling perturbations bounded by both the l0 and l1 norm. This work is the first of its kind to consider the certification of the l0-norm bounded perturbation in the action space. 

(iii) The paper theoretically validates that the proposed method can enhance certified robustness by taking into account the distribution of cumulative rewards during sampling, compared to previous approaches. 

(iv) Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing tighter bounds for l2 perturbations. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate the certification performance in various environments for l1 perturbations in observation and l0 perturbations in the action space.

In summary, the main contribution is a general framework for directly certifying the cumulative reward of smoothed policies under different norm-bounded perturbations by solving an optimisation problem, with superior performance over existing methods.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) policies can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that perturb the agent's observations or actions. 
- Prior certification methods for smoothed RL policies have limitations:
    - Only handle l2 norm bounded perturbations
    - Provide loose bounds on the certified reward
    - Break down reward into thresholds instead of directly certifying mean reward

Proposed Solution:
- Present a novel black-box certification method to directly certify mean cumulative reward of a smoothed RL policy under lp norm bounded perturbations
- Use f-divergence to measure distance between original and perturbed distributions
- Derive a convex optimization problem to compute lower bound on expected cumulative reward
- Can handle l1 norm (for observations) and l0 norm (for actions) perturbations

Main Contributions:
- Propose a general framework to directly certify mean cumulative reward under different norm bounded perturbations
- Show theoretically and empirically that directly optimizing cumulative reward gives better bounds
- Extend certification to l1 norm perturbations on observations and l0 norm perturbations on actions
- Experiments show proposed method computes tighter certified reward bounds compared to prior art, especially as perturbation budgets increase

In summary, the paper introduces an improved black-box certification approach for smoothed RL policies that can provably certify mean cumulative rewards under broader families of perturbations by formulating and solving a convex optimization problem. Both theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed technique.
