# [AligNeRF: High-Fidelity Neural Radiance Fields via Alignment-Aware   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09682)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we train high-fidelity neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from high-resolution images?

The key hypotheses are:

1) Misalignment between rendered NeRF outputs and ground truth images, caused by inaccurate camera poses and scene motion, hurts performance when training on high-resolution data.

2) Convolutions can be married with NeRF's coordinate-based MLP architecture to encode more neighborhood information and high-frequency details from high-res inputs. 

3) An alignment-aware loss and high-frequency loss can help address misalignment issues and improve detail in rendered images.

4) With these modifications, NeRF can be scaled to high-resolution training data and produce higher fidelity results, without significantly increasing training cost.

The experiments analyze the impact of misalignment, validate the benefits of the proposed convolution architecture and losses, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution outdoor scene datasets. Overall, the paper presents solutions to key challenges in scaling neural radiance fields to high-fidelity image synthesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AligNeRF, an alignment-aware training strategy to improve the performance of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) when trained on high-resolution images. Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Analyzing the issues that arise when scaling NeRF to high-resolution images, including misalignment between rendered and ground truth images caused by inaccurate camera poses and object motion. This is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively. 

- Proposing a convolution-augmented architecture that combines MLPs with convolutional layers to improve representational capacity while reducing parameters.

- Introducing an alignment-aware loss function based on patch matching rather than pixel matching to make training more robust to misalignment. 

- Adding a high-frequency loss term to better preserve details. 

- Showing improved performance over prior state-of-the-art NeRF methods on high-resolution outdoor scenes without significantly increasing training cost. The proposed techniques are general and can be applied to other NeRF models.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an effective strategy to train high-fidelity neural radiance fields by addressing alignment issues and recovering more details, enabling NeRF to scale to higher resolution inputs.
