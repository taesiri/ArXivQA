## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper provides detailed mathematical derivations for implementing differentiable Gaussian splatting in 3D computer graphics. The forward pass projects 3D Gaussians into 2D on the image plane using perspective projection and composites them front-to-back per pixel to construct the rendered image. The backward pass then computes gradients of a pixel-wise loss with respect to the Gaussian parameters, including color, opacity, 3D position, scale, and orientation. The key components derived are gradients of the alpha compositing, perspective projection of covariance matrices, and rotations via quaternions. The complete forward and backward passes are exposed in an easy-to-use Python API to facilitate further research and development of real-time differentiable rendering for graphics and vision applications. Overall, this paper offers a self-contained, comprehensive reference for the mathematical foundations behind the gsplat library for efficient differentiable splatting of 3D Gaussians.
