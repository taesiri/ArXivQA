# [Trusted Source Alignment in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06697)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes measuring an LLM property called trusted source alignment, presents a new dataset FactCheckQA for evaluating it, and analyzes design considerations for a TSA evaluation protocol.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of trusted source alignment (TSA) - the tendency of large language models to align their responses with content from trusted information sources when faced with controversial or uncertain claims. It presents FactCheckQA, a new dataset for evaluating TSA that contains over 20,000 verifiable claim statements extracted from fact-checking articles, along with contextual metadata and veracity labels from certified fact-checking organizations. The authors propose an evaluation protocol that converts claims into prompts asking the model if the claim is true, then measures agreement between the model's response and the journalist's verdict using balanced accuracy. They demonstrate the protocol on different sized PaLM models, finding TSA improves from near-random to 80% balanced accuracy as model scale increases. The paper also analyzes the effect of response extraction strategies, contextualization, and prompt wording on TSA evaluation. Overall, it provides a scalable methodology and dataset for probing whether language models align with trusted sources on controversial topics.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes an evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on their ability to align their responses with content from trusted publishers when presented with controversial or uncertain claims. This property is termed "trusted source alignment" (TSA). To enable measurement of TSA, the authors introduce FactCheckQA, a dataset of 20,871 verifiable and controversial claims sourced from certified fact-checking organizations and labeled with their verdicts. They establish a protocol for prompting an LLM with a claim, extracting a binary "yes/no" response, and comparing it to the FactCheckQA label to quantify TSA. Through experiments with Palm-2 models of varying sizes, they find TSA accuracy improves from near-random to around 80% balanced accuracy as model scale increases. The authors analyze the protocol's design considerations around response extraction, claim contextualization, and potential biases induced by the prompt wording. Overall, the work enables scalable evaluation of LLMs' reliability in responding to uncertain claims, using FactCheckQA as a benchmark of alignment with trusted sources. The insights could inform efforts to improve model trustworthiness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a new metric called trusted source alignment (TSA) to evaluate how well large language models align their responses with content from trusted publishers when faced with controversial claims. The authors create a dataset called FactCheckQA, establish a protocol for measuring TSA, and analyze the results on different model sizes, showing improvement in TSA as models scale up.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: how can we measure the tendency of large language models to align their responses with content from trusted sources when faced with controversial or uncertain claims? 

Specifically, the paper introduces the concept of "trusted source alignment" (TSA) and proposes:

1) The FactCheckQA dataset for evaluating TSA. This contains thousands of controversial, verifiable claims labeled by fact-checking organizations. 

2) An evaluation protocol to measure a model's TSA on this dataset, using metrics like balanced accuracy between model responses and verdicts from trusted sources.

3) An analysis of protocol design considerations like claim contextualization and prompt wording choices that can bias model responses.

4) Experiments applying their protocol to models like PaLM-2, finding improved alignment with trusted sources as model scale increases.

Overall, the central focus is on rigorously evaluating and improving language models' propensity to align with trustworthy sources when responding to uncertain or controversial prompts. The FactCheckQA dataset and TSA protocol are introduced as tools to enable this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing the concept of trusted source alignment (TSA) - a language model's tendency to align its responses with content from trusted sources when faced with controversial or uncertain claims. 

2. Creating the FactCheckQA dataset - a corpus of 20,871 verifiable and controversial claims labeled by certified fact checking organizations.

3. Proposing an evaluation protocol to measure TSA using FactCheckQA and analyzing design considerations like prompt formulation. 

4. Applying the protocol to demonstrate that TSA in PaLM models improves from near random to quite high as model size increases.

In summary, the paper presents TSA as a desirable language model property, provides a dataset and methodology to measure it, and shows that scaling up model size leads to better alignment with trusted sources. The main contribution is formalizing and operationalizing the evaluation of this previously loosely defined property.
