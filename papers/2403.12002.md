## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DreamMotion: Space-Time Self-Similarity Score Distillation for Zero-Shot Video Editing":

Problem:
- Text-driven video editing using diffusion models is challenging as it requires generating videos with realistic and temporally consistent motion. 
- Existing methods like directly sampling from text-to-video models or finetuning on input videos struggle to capture complex real-world motion.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a video editing framework called DreamMotion that avoids ancestral sampling and instead uses score distillation sampling to optimize an input video.
- Starting from an input video, appearance is injected into it using Video Delta Denoising Score (V-DDS) gradients from a text-to-video diffusion model. 
- To preserve structure and motion, spatial and temporal self-similarities are matched between the optimized video and the original input video.

Key Contributions:
- Pioneers a score distillation sampling based framework for zero-shot video editing that edits appearance while preserving motion.
- Introduces spatial self-similarity matching to align structures and temporal self-similarity for smoothing.
- Demonstrates superior video editing quality over state-of-the-art methods on both cascaded and non-cascaded diffusion models.
- Establishes strong capability in editing appearance accurately per text prompt while maintaining motion fidelity.

In summary, the paper presents a novel framework DreamMotion that can inject target visual concepts into a video while preserving its original motion integrity. This is achieved via optimized score distillation and self-similarity guidance, outperforming existing diffusion-based video editing techniques.
