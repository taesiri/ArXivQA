# [Deep Set Neural Networks for forecasting asynchronous bioprocess   timeseries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02079)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes using Deep Set Neural Networks with triplet encoding of the input data to successfully handle sparse and irregular time series data from bioprocesses, without needing imputation or alignment procedures. The method handles missing data naturally and is invariant to permutations of the observations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Deep Set Networks achieve better predictive performance compared to simply fitting macrokinetic models, and perform on par with neural networks using imputation and alignment pre-processing. On simulated microbial growth data with extreme sparsity and irregularity, Deep Set Networks provide accurate forecasts. The method is widely applicable for various bioprocess monitoring, control, and optimization tasks involving sparse measurements. Overall, the paper makes a compelling case that Deep Learning models like Deep Sets can effectively leverage sparse and asynchronous timeseries data as-is, without biases introduced by imputation or alignment. This enables more accurate modeling while avoiding laborious data wrangling procedures.
