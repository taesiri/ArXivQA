# [Large Language Model Situational Awareness Based Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16127)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing AI agents that can make flexible real-world decisions is challenging due to unpredictability and the need for nuanced judgements in complex situations.
- Lack of situational awareness in AI systems has been identified as a major cause of unintended outcomes.
- Prior AI reasoning and planning research makes unrealistic assumptions or focuses on predefined domains rather than open-ended real-world planning.

Proposed Solution: 
- Assess and enhance large language models' (LLMs) capacity for situational awareness based planning when faced with open-ended hazard scenarios. 
- Use a standardized benchmark of 24 home hazard situations across 4 reasoning complexity levels, with gold standard human solutions.
- Evaluate LLMs on perceptive, comprehension and projection abilities needed for mapping states to actions.  
- Employ prompts directing models to deeply consider relationships and iterative consequences (Situational Awareness Planning prompts).
- Use a collaborative framework with one LLM generating plan proposals and another LLM evaluating proposals and providing feedback to refine the plans over multiple iterations.

Main Contributions:
- Novel benchmarks and metrics for standardized assessment of LLM planning capacities based on situational awareness.
- A unique dataset of over 500 home hazard scenarios to spur progress.  
- Demonstration that prompting and multi-agent schemes significantly enhance LLM performance in context-sensitive planning tasks.
- Identification of inherent reliability challenges and limitations in mapping world states to actions without environmental guidance, despite advances in simulated domains.
- Highlighting exciting future directions such as expanded planning corpus fine-tuning and optimizations for triggering fast latent planning.

The paper conclusively demonstrates current methods' promise and limitations through rigorous comparison, aiming to catalyze investigating reliable goal-directed reasoning for situated agents.
