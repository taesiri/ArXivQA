# [Hierarchical Tree-structured Knowledge Graph For Academic Insight Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Research surveys pose challenges for beginner researchers lacking research training to quickly understand directions and new findings in a topic. 
- Existing knowledge graphs for research navigation rely on keywords and fail to clearly show logical hierarchies across papers.  
- Paper recommendation systems use text similarity but don't explain connections between resolved issues and findings.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph that reflects inheritance insights (citation relationships) and relevance insights (connections between issue findings and resolutions) to support beginner researcher survey of a topic.  

Methods & Contributions:
- Create an "insight survey dataset" from S2ORC papers containing citations, full text, metadata. Focus on "Conclusion" and "Limitations" sections.
- Use Sentence BERT and SVM classifier to label sentences as "Resolved", "Neutral", or "Finding" viewpoints.
- Construct inheritance tree showing citation branches and relevance tree showing findingâ†’resolved links.
- Visualize trees using node/edge metadata to show paper themes, keywords, issues resolved/found, inheritance, relevance chains. 

Key Benefits:
- Provides beginner researchers intuitive visualization of research directions, branches, and connections in a topic.  
- Guides understanding and exploration of topic inheritance and relevance insights across papers.
- Enables quickly identifying research clues and expansion directions.

In summary, the key contribution is developing knowledge graphs with hierarchical tree structures reflecting citation and relevance connections across papers to intuitively guide beginner researcher survey and understanding of a topic.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph with inheritance and relevance trees to efficiently guide novice researchers in gaining insights and exploring research topics and directions based on academic papers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph with two types of trees - an inheritance tree and a relevance tree - to support insight survey for research beginners. 

2. It develops a methodology to construct these trees by processing academic papers to extract insight sentences, calculating similarity to determine relevance chains, and selecting root and leaf nodes based on citations and relevance scores.

3. It visualizes the knowledge graph using pyvis to provide researchers with visual guidance on research directions and connections between papers based on inheritance and relevance.

4. It demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach through a case study on the HotpotQA topic, generating sample inheritance and relevance trees. 

5. It discusses the interpretability and potential for further development of the knowledge graph to incorporate additional text and subjective evaluations to enhance relevance and recommendations.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel knowledge graph methodology to efficiently guide novice researchers in gaining insights and surveying research topics by modeling inheritance and relevance relationships between academic papers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes building a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph. What are the key benefits of using a tree structure compared to other graph structures for representing academic insights and connections?

2. The knowledge graph has two components - an inheritance tree and a relevance tree. What is the purpose of each tree and how do they provide complementary insights? 

3. The paper extracts "insight sentences" from papers to capture key resolving statements and remaining issues/limitations. What NLP techniques does it use for identifying and extracting these sentences? How effective is this approach?

4. The inheritance tree is built using citation relationships between papers. What criteria does the paper use to select root and child papers when constructing this tree? How does this capture inheritance of ideas/methods?

5. The relevance tree connects papers using similarity of "insight sentences". How exactly does the paper measure semantic similarity between insight sentences? What are limitations of relying only on sentence embeddings?  

6. The knowledge graph nodes include extracted keywords and insight sentences. What value do these provide to researchers in understanding connections and gaining insights compared to just displaying paper titles?

7. The paper demonstrates constructing knowledge graphs for the HotpotQA topic. How effectively does the approach generalize to other topics and datasets? What customizations may be needed?

8. What strategies does the paper propose for future expansion of breadth and depth of the knowledge graphs? What are the challenges foreseen?  

9. The paper utilizes the S2ORC dataset as its base corpus. What advantages or limitations does this dataset have compared to others like Unarxiv for supporting academic insight analysis?

10. The paper focuses on supporting beginner researchers. What qualitative or quantitative validation does it provide to demonstrate the effectiveness for target users? What additional evaluations could be beneficial?
