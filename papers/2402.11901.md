# [Real-World Planning with PDDL+ and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world planning problems require highly expressive modeling languages to capture system intricacies, but uptake of expressive languages like PDDL+ has been slow. 
- There are few PDDL+ planners available and they have rigid, complex codebases making them hard to adapt to new scenarios.
- PDDL+ has limited expressiveness for defining advanced mathematical expressions needed for realistic models.

Proposed Solution - Nyx Planner
- A new lightweight and adaptable PDDL+ planner called Nyx.
- Implemented in Python for accessibility, extensibility and rapid prototyping.
- Equipped with a range of search algorithms, heuristics and other features.
- Designed to be easily extended, e.g. adding new mathematical expressions.
- Supports "semantic attachments" to integrate external simulators.

Main Contributions:
- Nyx planner with focus on simplicity, flexibility and extensibility.
- Precondition tree for efficient grounded action checking.
- Straightforward extensions to PDDL+ language expressiveness.
- Semantic attachments to integrate advanced external functions.
- Showcased Nyx effectively solving real-world planning problems.

In summary, the paper presents a new PDDL+ planner called Nyx aimed at tackling real-world problems by emphasizing accessibility, adaptability and expressiveness beyond core PDDL+. Key features include a precondition tree, mathematical extensions to PDDL+ and semantic attachments.
