# [Tackling Missing Values in Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasting: A   Generative Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03631)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Probabilistic wind power forecasting is crucial for power system operations, but often hindered by missing values in historical data due to sensor failures etc. 
- The common "impute then predict" strategy for handling missing data can introduce errors that degrade forecast accuracy.
- Existing methods lack solid theoretical foundations for parameter estimation with missing data or have impractical computational complexity. 

Proposed Solution:
- Treat missing feature values and forecast targets indifferently, and predict all unknowns simultaneously based on observations.
- Develop a generative model based on a variational autoencoder with normalizing flows for flexible posterior approximation.
- Model estimates joint distribution of features and targets during training based on partially observed data.
- At forecasting stage, sample from approximate posterior and decoder models to generate observation proposals. Assign weights to proposals based on observation likelihood.
- Generate probabilistic forecasts via importance resampling and marginalization over missing features.

Main Contributions:
- Provides theoretically sound parameter estimation by maximizing observation likelihood based on MAR assumption. 
- Avoids errors from imputation preprocessing and allows seamless handling of missing data.
- Computationally more efficient compared to prior FCS approach, with complexity unaffected by number of scenarios.
- Demonstrates superior forecast accuracy over benchmark methods on real-world wind dataset.
- Establishes applicability for very short-term probabilistic forecasting with missing data.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient generative modeling approach for probabilistic wind forecasting that can inherently account for missing data without compromising accuracy or computational practicality.
