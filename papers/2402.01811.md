# [A Distributionally Robust Optimisation Approach to Fair Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01811)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Credit scoring models can exhibit unfair bias against certain demographic groups, which is an important ethical issue. 
- Many existing techniques to enhance fairness may fail to maintain fairness on out-of-sample data due to distributional shifts over time.

Proposed Solution:  
- Use distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to make the model robust against distributional shifts while enhancing fairness. DRO works by optimizing the worst-case over a set of plausible neighboring distributions rather than just the empirical distribution.

- Specifically, they propose a distributionally robust fair logistic regression (DRFLR) which includes a fairness penalty term and constructs an ambiguity set using the Wasserstein metric to account for distributional shifts. 

- The Wasserstein ambiguity set allows controlling the relative importance given to shifts in sensitive attributes vs other features. Additional hyperparameters also control tradeoffs between performance, fairness and robustness.

Key Contributions:
- First application of DRO with fairness constraints to credit scoring.
- Empirical evaluation on 5 credit scoring datasets shows DRFLR substantially enhances fairness according to the LEO metric, with minimal impact on predictive performance.
- Analysis and guidelines provided for tuning the various DRFLR hyperparameters.
- Highlights issues with common fairness metrics like statistical parity that depend on choice of threshold.
- Experiments with shifting marginal distributions demonstrate improved robustness of DRFLR to such distributional shifts.

Overall, the paper makes a strong case that DRO is a promising approach for fair and robust credit scoring models, while also laying out useful practical guidance and insights for further research to address existing limitations.
