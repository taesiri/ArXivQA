# [Timeseries Suppliers Allocation Risk Optimization via Deep Black   Litterman Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of supplier selection and order allocation for enterprises. Enterprises need to select suppliers and allocate order quantities to ensure a steady supply of materials for production while minimizing risks like supply shortages. However, modeling the dynamic relationships between order demands, supply volumes, and supplier capabilities over time is complex. Existing models also suffer from data reliability issues when there is missing data for certain suppliers.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Deep Black-Litterman Model (DBLM) to formulate the supplier selection issue as a risk optimization problem. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce a Perspective Matrix based on the Black-Litterman portfolio optimization model to represent the enterprise's view of suppliers' capabilities and risks. This matrix captures competition dynamics among suppliers.

2) Develop a Supplier Relationship Network using a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network to model complex temporal and spatial relationships between suppliers, order volumes and supply volumes. 

3) Address missing data issues with a Masked Ranking Mechanism to transform the task into optimizing the ranking of supplier risks rather than predicting quantities. A novel loss function based on supplier shortage rate rankings is used.

Main Contributions:

- First work to integrate Perspective Matrix and Black-Litterman model to translate supplier selection to a risk optimization problem capturing temporal and spatial dynamics.

- Enhanced modeling of complex supplier interdependencies with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network.

- Introduced Masked Ranking Mechanism and new loss function to address data reliability issues for improved supplier ranking.

- Demonstrated superior performance over baselines on two real-world datasets. The model provides more accurate predictions and confidence intervals compared to traditional models.

The paper's method advances supplier selection modeling using financial portfolio optimization ideas and graph neural networks. By tackling data reliability challenges, it also enables improved decision making by enterprises regarding suppliers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a Deep Black-Litterman Model to optimize supplier selection and order allocation over time by modeling supplier relationships as a spatio-temporal graph and addressing data credibility issues with a masked ranking mechanism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing the Black-Litterman (BL) model and the Perspective Matrix to transform the supplier selection and order allocation problem into a risk optimization problem. The Perspective Matrix represents the competitive dynamics among suppliers, capturing both temporal and spatial relationships.

2. Developing a Supplier Relationship Network using a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network to enhance understanding of complex supplier interdependencies. 

3. Addressing credibility issues in zero order scenarios with a Masked Ranking Mechanism to improve supplier ranking efficiency.

4. Demonstrating superior performance of their model on two datasets compared to traditional models for supplier selection and order allocation.

In summary, the key innovations are using the BL model and Perspective Matrix to formulate the problem as risk optimization, modeling supplier relationships with a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, and handling missing data with a Masked Ranking Mechanism. The proposed model shows better performance than existing methods.
