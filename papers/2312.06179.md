# [Dynamic Weighted Combiner for Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06179)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Dynamic Weighted Combiner (DWC) approach to address two major overlooked challenges in mixed-modal image retrieval (MMIR): the unequal importance of image and text modalities in queries, and labeling noise in the text descriptions from web data. The DWC contains three key components: (1) An Editable Modality De-equalizer (EMD) that purifies and unequally weights the image and text features based on estimated modality importance. (2) A dynamic soft-similarity label generator that relaxes the noisy hard similarity labels to avoid overfitting. (3) A CLIP-based mutual enhancement module trained with a mixed-modality contrastive loss to reduce modality gaps. Experiments on three MMIR datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The approach effectively handles the modality importance disparity and labeling noise issues in MMIR through its specialized model components and training methodology. Key strengths are the interpretability of the learned unequal modality weights, the ability to mitigate label noise, and leveraging CLIP to bridge cross-modal gaps.
