# [Self-Consistency Training for Hamiltonian Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09560)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Hamiltonian prediction aims to predict the Hamiltonian matrix of a molecule directly from its structure using machine learning models. It can provide all properties computable from DFT at once and serve to accelerate DFT calculations.
- However, its applicability is limited by the lack of labeled data (precomputed Hamiltonian matrices), restricting its application to small molecules. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper highlights that Hamiltonian prediction has a unique self-consistency principle based on the basic Kohn-Sham equation of DFT. 
- This allows designing a training loss that enforces the self-consistency between the predicted Hamiltonian and the one reconstructed from the eigenvectors of the prediction.
- As the loss purely relies on the Kohn-Sham equation that determines the target, no label is required. It allows leveraging abundant unlabeled molecular structures.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes self-consistency training for Hamiltonian prediction, which enables training without labeled data.
- Shows self-consistency training substantially improves generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios by leveraging more data.
- Demonstrates self-consistency training is more efficient for improving generalization than generating more labels, due to its amortization effect over data.
- Pushes the applicability of Hamiltonian prediction to larger molecules (56 atoms) than previously feasible, showing practical relevance. Overall addresses the data scarcity problem, a main difficulty of the formulation.

In summary, the paper proposes a principled training approach for Hamiltonian prediction that compensates data scarcity with physical laws. This distinguishes the formulation from other property prediction tasks. The benefits of improved efficiency and generalizability push the applicability of the formulation to larger scale.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-consistency training method for Hamiltonian prediction that enables training without labeled data by enforcing the model to satisfy the basic equation of density functional theory, which allows leveraging abundant unlabeled molecular data to substantially improve generalization and prediction efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a self-consistency training method for Hamiltonian prediction that does not require labeled data. The key contributions are:

1. It highlights that Hamiltonian prediction has a self-consistency principle based on the basic equation of density functional theory (DFT). This allows designing a training loss that enforces the model prediction to satisfy the equation, hence provides supervision without requiring labels.

2. Self-consistency training enables leveraging unlimited unlabeled molecular structures to improve model generalization. This addresses the data scarcity issue in Hamiltonian prediction. Experiments show substantially improved generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios.

3. Self-consistency training is more efficient than generating labels using DFT since it amortizes the computation over structures. This is empirically verified and allows pushing applicability of Hamiltonian prediction to larger molecules.

4. With the above benefits, the paper demonstrates Hamiltonian prediction and derivation of molecular properties on much larger molecules (up to 56 atoms) than previously achieved. This expands the applicability and practical relevance of the formulation.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a self-training method that compensates data scarcity in Hamiltonian prediction with physical principles and enables improved efficiency, generalizability and applicability.

8. The results show that self-consistency training achieves better performance on predicting properties like HOMO-LUMO gap compared to supervised training. Provide possible reasons behind this observation.

9. What practical computational techniques like density fitting and grid integration were employed to ensure efficient Hamiltonian reconstruction for large systems? Analyze their impact.

10. The method relies on automatic differentiation through an eigensolver. What numerical stability issues does this cause during training and how were they addressed? Explain if better eigendecomposition algorithms can improve training.
