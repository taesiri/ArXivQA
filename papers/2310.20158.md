# [GAR-meets-RAG Paradigm for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20158)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called RRR (Rewrite-Retrieve-Rerank) for zero-shot information retrieval. The key idea is to leverage large language models (LLMs) to iteratively improve both retrieval and rewrite stages in a feedback loop. Specifically, it uses an LLM-based RAG model to generate query rewrites, which feeds into a GAR model for document retrieval from a corpus. A relevance model based on an LLM is used to score and filter retrieved documents before passing them back to the rewriter. After several iterations, a final re-ranking stage with an LLM improves precision. Through extensive experiments on BEIR and TREC-DL benchmarks, RRR establishes new state-of-the-art results, outperforming previous best methods by up to 17% in terms of nDCG@10 and Recall@100. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GAR-meets-RAG recurrence formulation and show that iteratively enhancing recall and precision through multiple stages leads to improved end-to-end retrieval performance in the zero-shot setting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel recurrence formulation for zero-shot information retrieval that iteratively improves retrieval via generation-augmented retrieval (GAR) and rewrite via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel recurrence formulation for zero-shot information retrieval that combines generation-augmented retrieval (GAR) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigms. The method iteratively improves retrieval via GAR and rewrite via RAG stages in a feedback loop. A key principle is that the rewrite-retrieval stages aim to maximize recall while a final re-ranking stage improves precision. The authors propose an algorithm called RRR that implements this formulation using pre-trained language models like GPT-3.5 for rewrite, relevance assessment, and re-ranking stages and BM25 for retrieval. RRR establishes new state-of-the-art results on BEIR and TREC-DL passage retrieval benchmarks, outperforming previous best techniques by up to 17% in recall and nDCG metrics on several datasets. The gains highlight the effectiveness of the proposed feedback formulation and the design choices to improve recall and precision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key idea in the paper:

The paper proposes a new recurrence framework for zero-shot information retrieval that iteratively improves retrieval and rewrite stages via feedback loops between a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model and a generation-augmented retrieval (GAR) model.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a novel formulation for the zero-shot information retrieval (IR) problem, with the central hypothesis being that iteratively improving retrieval (via GAR) and rewrite (via RAG) stages can lead to better performance compared to existing paradigms. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1) Using a RAG model to produce query rewrites, which then feed into a GAR model for retrieval, can overcome limitations of existing GAR and RAG paradigms alone. 

2) Maximizing recall via iterative rewrite and retrieve stages, along with maximizing precision via a final re-rank stage, is an effective overall approach.

3) Properly defining the way of merging ranked lists at each iteration and controlling the number of documents retrieved is important for good performance. 

4) Using relevance scores to filter documents and prompt the rewrite model helps make the proposed formulation less brittle.

The key research questions examined are whether the proposed GAR-meets-RAG recurrence formulation and RRR algorithm outperform existing methods, whether the feedback loop helps improve performance, and how design choices impact results. Extensive experiments aim to validate the above hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel GAR-meets-RAG recurrence formulation for the zero-shot information retrieval problem, that uses a RAG model to produce query rewrites, which then feed into a GAR model for retrieval.

2. It designs a simple, iterative algorithm called RRR (Rewrite-Retrieve-Rerank) that maximizes recall via rewrite-retrieve stages and precision via a final re-rank stage. 

3. It performs extensive evaluations on zero-shot passage retrieval benchmarks BEIR and TREC-DL. The proposed RRR method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the BEIR benchmark, outperforming previous best results on 6 out of 8 datasets in terms of Recall@100 and nDCG@10 metrics.

So in summary, the key contribution is a novel formulation and algorithm for zero-shot information retrieval that combines the strengths of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and generation-augmented retrieval (GAR) paradigms in an iterative framework to achieve state-of-the-art retrieval performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a novel recurrence formulation for zero-shot information retrieval that iteratively improves retrieval and rewrite stages in a feedback loop. Key comparisons to other research include:

1) Compared to existing GAR and RAG paradigms, this paper proposes a combination where a RAG model produces query rewrites to feed into a GAR model for retrieval. This allows leveraging the strengths of both paradigms.

2) Compared to other zero-shot IR techniques, the proposed RRR method establishes new state-of-the-art results on multiple BEIR and TREC-DL datasets, with gains over the best existing methods. For example, RRR achieves up to 17% relative improvement in nDCG@10 over RankGPT.

3) Compared to methods that also use large language models like GPT-3.5 for IR, RRR shows the benefits of using the language models in an iterative framework with feedback between rewrite, retrieve and rerank stages. 

4) Compared to relevance feedback techniques, RRR incorporates feedback between the language model based retriever and rewriter components, instead of just improving the retriever.

In summary, a key novelty is the proposed recurrence formulation and showing its effectiveness quantitatively against existing methods, especially other techniques that leverage large language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest two main future research directions:

1. Designing compact yet effective models for re-ranking in the zero-shot setting that can improve over what retrieval/relevance models achieve. The trade-off between retrieval performance gains and inference cost depends on the application scenario, so more efficient models are needed.

2. Learning smaller rewrite and relevance models via distillation techniques. The formulation they develop is general, but currently relies on large language models. Distillation could allow the use of smaller models to reduce inference cost while retaining performance.

2. The paper introduces a 3-stage pipeline consisting of rewrite, retrieve, and rerank. What is the motivation behind having separate stages for improving recall versus precision? How do the different stages interact?

3. The rewrite stage uses a RAG model to generate query rewrites. What adaptations were made to the standard RAG formulation to make it suitable for this purpose? How does the rewritten query help improve retrieval?
