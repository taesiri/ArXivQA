# [PersonNeRF: Personalized Reconstruction from Photo Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08504)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to take an unstructured photo collection of a person with varying poses, viewpoints, and appearances over time and build a personalized 3D model that can render novel combinations of these attributes not directly observed in the input images. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Modeling a canonical neural volumetric representation of the person in a standard pose allows using a shared pose-dependent motion field to map different observed poses back to this canonical space, enabling generalization across sparse pose observations. 

2) Embedding the diverse appearances into a latent space and conditioning the canonical volume on appearance will enable the model to synthesize realistic textures for novel viewpoints by sharing information across the appearances through the latent space.

3) Regularizing the geometry to be locally smooth and enforcing an opacity loss will improve the canonical volume's shape and appearance consistency across viewpoints despite having only sparse viewpoint observations per appearance.

In summary, the paper aims to show that sharing information across sparse observations in pose, viewpoint, and appearance through a canonical-pose volumetric representation, appearance embeddings, and appropriate regularization losses can enable high-quality free-viewpoint rendering from extremely challenging unstructured photo collections.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing PersonNeRF, a method that takes an unstructured photo collection of a person with varying poses and appearances, and enables rendering the person under novel combinations of viewpoint, body pose, and appearance. 

The key ideas are:

- Representing the person as a canonical neural radiance field (NeRF) volume in a T-pose, and using a shared motion field to map it to different observed poses. This allows modeling diverse appearances that all rely on the same underlying motion model. 

- Regularizing the canonical volume's geometry using losses applied to renderings of the volume from unseen viewpoints. This results in higher quality geometry from sparse view observations.

- Modeling appearance using a latent appearance code, which enables rendering high-quality textures for unobserved regions by sharing information across the person's appearances. 

- Building a personalized space for the subject by mapping coordinates of viewpoint, pose, and appearance to corresponding renderings. This supports intuitive exploration of novel combinations of these attributes.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing a personalized neural volumetric representation and optimization approach that enables high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of a person from an unstructured photo collection with varying poses and appearances. The method combines ideas like canonical volumes, motion fields, appearance embedding, and novel view regularization to address this very challenging sparse data scenario.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on 3D reconstruction of humans from images:

- It builds on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) which have become a popular representation for reconstructing both static scenes and dynamic humans recently. The paper specifically extends HumanNeRF, a previous method that reconstructs humans from monocular video, to handle unstructured photo collections.

- A key novelty is the approach to handling sparse observations and changing appearance in photo collections. Previous NeRF methods assume hundreds of observations per scene. This paper shows how to regularize the model and embed appearance to enable modeling from very sparse observations of each appearance.

- The method represents the subject in a canonical T-pose and uses a shared motion field to map different observations to this space. This allows modeling diverse appearances with a single coherent model. Other recent works like PIFuHD directly model the observation space.

- For humans, most previous work focuses on clothed people. This paper tackles the harder case of modeling appearance changes like different outfits. The most related works are neural avatar representations but they require more posed multi-view capture.

- The personalized space representation built from the model is novel and allows intuitive exploration. Most works focus only on novel view synthesis. This idea of exploring appearance and pose axes could enable applications like virtual try-on.

- Quantitative results significantly outperform HumanNeRF and qualitative results look compelling. The method seems effective for this challenging scenario, but lacks absolute ground truth data for evaluation.

In summary, the paper makes nice extensions to recent neural volumetric representations to handle diverse human appearance from sparse photo collections. The personalized space and applications are exciting directions for future work.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents PersonNeRF, a method that takes an unstructured photo collection of a person with images spanning multiple years, varying outfits/appearances, and different poses, and builds a customized 3D neural representation that can render novel combinations of viewpoint, pose, and appearance. It extends prior work on HumanNeRF that required hundreds of images of a subject without appearance changes.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents PersonNeRF, a method for transforming an unstructured photo collection of a person into a 3D representation that can render the person under novel combinations of camera viewpoint, body pose, and appearance. The key idea is to model a single canonical-pose volumetric representation of the person that uses a shared motion field to deform to different body poses. The canonical volume is parameterized by an MLP conditioned on an appearance embedding vector, allowing it to adapt to different appearances observed across the photo collection. Additionally, the method includes losses to regularize the geometry to be smooth when rendered from novel viewpoints, addressing the issue of sparse viewpoint observations. 

The benefits of this approach are demonstrated through experiments on photo collections of Roger Federer spanning 12 years and containing variations in clothing, hair, and age. The method is able to render the reconstructed Roger Federer model under novel combinations of viewpoint, pose, and appearance while maintaining consistency. Comparisons to prior work show improved rendering quality and realism. Ultimately, the paper shows how conditioning a single canonical volume on appearance, along with viewpoint regularization, can enable high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of humans from sparse, unstructured photo collections with appearance variation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents PersonNeRF, a method for taking an unstructured photo collection of a person with images spanning different times, clothing, and poses, and building a neural radiance field representation that can render novel views of the person in arbitrary combinations of camera viewpoint, body pose, and appearance. 

The key idea is to model a single canonical T-pose volumetric representation of the person using a neural network conditioned on learned appearance embeddings. This canonical volume is warped to different observed poses using a shared skeletal motion field. Regularization losses are used to encourage smooth and consistent geometry. Modeling a shared canonical volume allows appearance information to be shared across the sparse observations in the photo collection. Using a common motion field enables pose consistency when rendering the person in novel clothing. This approach is able to render high quality results from the challenging unstructured photo collections, outperforming prior work on free-viewpoint rendering of humans.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents PersonNeRF, a method for transforming an unstructured photo collection of a person into a personalized 3D model that enables rendering the subject from novel combinations of viewpoint, body pose, and appearance. The key idea is to optimize for a canonical T-pose volumetric representation that can change appearance based on latent codes, while using a shared motion field to deform the canonical volume to match different observations. To handle sparse observations where a pose or appearance may be only seen from one viewpoint, the method regularizes the geometry to encourage smooth and opaque surfaces. The canonical volume is represented as a neural radiance field (NeRF) conditioned on an appearance embedding, and the motion field consists only of skeletal motion without non-rigid deformation. Once optimized, this model allows intuitive exploration and novel synthesis of a space spanned by camera viewpoint, body pose taken from the observations, and appearance. Comparisons to prior work show improved rendering quality and fewer artifacts for this challenging scenario of building a model from sparse, unstructured photo collections with varying appearance over time. Key contributions are the shared motion field for sparse observations, appearance embedding to enable multi-appearance modeling, and the unseen view regularization, which together enable high-quality free-viewpoint rendering and traversal of the resulting personalized space.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents PersonNeRF, a method that takes an unstructured collection of photos of a person captured across different times, body poses, and appearances, and enables novel view synthesis of that person with arbitrary combinations of viewpoint, pose, and appearance. PersonNeRF builds a single canonical-pose volumetric representation of the person conditioned on appearance embeddings, and uses a shared pose-dependent motion field to deform the canonical volume to match the observed poses. To handle the sparsity of observations in unstructured photo collections, where a given pose or appearance may be observed only once, PersonNeRF employs regularization of the canonical geometry using losses encouraging smooth and opaque surfaces. By optimizing a space of embeddings corresponding to the observed poses and appearances, PersonNeRF is able to render compelling novel combinations of attributes not present in the original photos. Experiments demonstrate higher quality results than prior work on challenging real-world photo collections.
