# [Learning Dual-arm Object Rearrangement for Cartesian Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13634)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the dual-arm object rearrangement problem for Cartesian robots. The goal is to transfer all objects from source locations to target locations with minimum total completion time. The key challenge is developing an effective object-to-arm assignment strategy to minimize cumulative task execution time and maximize dual-arm cooperation efficiency. As the number of objects increases, traditional offline search-based assignment methods become inefficient due to combinatorial complexity.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an online reinforcement learning (RL) based method for object-to-arm assignment. The assignment problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved under an RL framework by modeling the two arms as separate agents. An attention-based neural network is designed to model dependencies between different input states (arm, object, global mask) to help identify the most reasonable object-to-arm correspondences in each assignment round.  

The lower level implements a heuristic-based dual-arm motion planning method to generate collision-free trajectories once assignments are made. Traditional search-based assignment methods are also adapted to this problem setting for comparison.

Main Contributions:
- An online RL framework and attention-based network for efficient and scalable object-to-arm assignment in dual arm rearrangement. Computation time scales linearly w.r.t. number of objects.
- Achieves superior performance over adapted search-based methods in total completion time and computation efficiency.
- Generalizes well across different numbers of objects when trained on a relatively small number.
- Integrates the approach on a real dual-arm rearrangement system with ROS.
