# [EndoOOD: Uncertainty-aware Out-of-distribution Detection in Capsule   Endoscopy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) enables non-invasive visualization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is used for disease diagnosis. However, existing classification models for WCE primarily assume a closed-world setting and are unable to effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data, such as anatomical images. This poses challenges in accurately interpreting and identifying images during WCE diagnosis.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the EndoOOD framework to address the OOD detection challenge in WCE diagnosis. The framework has three key components:
  1) Uncertainty-aware mixup training strategy - Enhances the model's ability to distinguish between ID and OOD inputs by incorporating uncertainty calibration into the mixup training process. This solves issues related to uncertainty estimation that arise from standard mixup techniques.  
  2) Long-tailed ID data calibration - Alleviates overconfident probability predictions for high-frequency classes by integrating category quantity information into temperature scaling and label smoothing to enable better calibration.
  3) Virtual-logit matching (VIM) based post-hoc inference - Accurately computes presence of OOD data while minimizing information loss by matching logits from feature residuals against the original logits.
  
Main Contributions:  
- Proposes the EndoOOD framework incorporating multiple uncertainty calibration techniques to tackle OOD detection challenges in WCE diagnosis scenarios.
- Introduces techniques like uncertainty-aware mixup training and long-tailed ID data calibration to enhance model robustness and reliability of diagnostic capabilities. 
- Demonstrates superior performance over 12 state-of-the-art methods on the Kvasir-Capsule and CIFAR-10 datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of the framework.
- The proposed techniques can serve as an effective tool to improve disease screening and decision-making for healthcare professionals using WCE procedures.

In summary, the EndoOOD framework leverages multiple uncertainty estimation and calibration strategies during training and inference to reliably detect OOD inputs arising in WCE diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate capabilities to distinguish between OOD and ID data more accurately compared to existing methods.
