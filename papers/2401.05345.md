# [DISTWAR: Fast Differentiable Rendering on Raster-based Rendering   Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper focuses on accelerating differentiable rendering for rasterization pipelines on GPUs. Differentiable rendering is used to train 3D models to represent scenes using gradient descent, with important applications in novel view synthesis, 3D scanning, photogrammetry, etc. Recent works have demonstrated that integrating the rasterization pipeline into differentiable rendering (using primitives like points, meshes, ellipsoids instead of continuous functions) enables high quality, high speed photo-realistic rendering. 

However, the paper finds that training these models is still slow, taking many hours even on powerful GPUs. Through detailed profiling, the authors identify that atomic operations for accumulating gradients during backpropagation constitute a major bottleneck, consuming on average 30-65% of training time. The massive number of atomic operations overwhelm the L2 atomic units and lead to long stalls at the streaming multiprocessors (SMs).

The key insight is that there is locality in the atomic updates - threads within a warp often update gradients of the same model parameters. The paper proposes DISTWAR, which accelerates atomic updates by (1) performing warp-level reduction of atomic updates using registers in the SMs, and (2) balancing computation between warp-level reduction and L2 atomics to maximize throughput. This reduces traffic to L2 atomic units while still utilizing them.

The authors implement a software-only version of DISTWAR using existing CUDA shuffle intrinsics like __shfl_sync(), and compare it to state-of-the-art software reduction techniques. Key results on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU:
- Up to 5.7x (2.44x avg.) speedup of gradient computation
- Up to 2.4x (1.41x avg.) end-to-end speedup
- 10x reduction in stall cycles per instruction

In summary, the paper performs detailed characterization of an important emerging workload, identifies key bottlenecks, and proposes a software solution to alleviate it. The techniques can enable faster training for raster-based differentiable rendering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a software technique called DISTWAR to accelerate atomic operations in emerging raster-based differentiable rendering workloads by performing warp-level reduction of atomic updates at the streaming multiprocessors and balancing atomic computation between the cores and L2 atomic units.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing DISTWAR (Distributed Warp-level and Atomic-Unit Collaborative Reduction), a novel primitive to accelerate atomic operations in GPUs for applications that:

1) Generate a large number of atomic requests, overwhelming the hardware queues and compute units that process atomics. 

2) Have most threads within a warp performing atomic updates to the same memory locations.

Specifically, DISTWAR leverages two key ideas:

1) Performing warp-level reduction at the streaming multiprocessor (SM) cores themselves using registers to exploit intra-warp locality in atomic updates. 

2) Dynamically distributing the atomic computation between warp-level reduction at the SMs and atomic processing using existing units at the L2 cache to increase overall throughput.

The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DISTWAR in accelerating an important emerging application domain - rasterization-based differentiable rendering for 3D scene reconstruction. On real GPUs, DISTWAR achieved significant speedups on average of up to 2.44x on the gradient computation and up to 1.41x on the overall application runtime.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Differentiable rendering - Using gradient-based optimization to train a model that can render images of a 3D scene. Enables applications like novel view synthesis and scene reconstruction. 

- Rasterization - A fast technique to render 3D scenes by projecting geometric primitives like triangles onto a 2D image. Used in computer graphics pipelines.

- Atomic operations - Concurrent operations that appear to execute atomically from the point of view of other threads. Used when multiple threads update the same memory location.

- Gradient computation - Computing the gradients of a loss function with respect to model parameters. Key bottleneck identified during differentiable rendering training.

- Warp-level reduction - Aggregating values across threads within a GPU warp using fast thread-level communication before performing slower global memory atomics.

- Balancing threshold - Tunable parameter that controls scheduling between warp-level and L2 atomic units in DISTWAR.

- 3D Gaussian Splatting - A specific differentiable rendering approach that models scenes using 3D Gaussians.

So in summary, the key focus is on accelerating atomic operations during gradient computation in GPU-based differentiable rendering by introducing a technique called DISTWAR.
