# [Pig aggression classification using CNN, Transformers and Recurrent   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08528)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Monitoring aggressive behavior in pigs is important for animal welfare and farm management, but manual monitoring is error-prone and time-consuming. 
- Automated video analysis using computer vision and deep learning can help address this problem.

Proposed Solution:
- Authors created a dataset of 421 video clips showing aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors of pigs in a commercial farm. 
- Evaluated several deep learning techniques for automated classification of aggressive behavior from videos:
  - Convolutional networks: ResNet3D, Resnet(2+1)D
  - Recurrent + Convolutional network: CNN-LSTM
  - Transformer networks: ViViT, STAM, TimeSformer

Key Contributions:
- New dataset of annotated pig behavior videos captured in a commercial farm environment.
- Evaluation of multiple video classification techniques - transformers, convolutional, recurrent networks - on the problem of detecting aggressive behavior.  
- Found that TimeSformer transformer achieved best performance, with accuracy of 0.729 and precision of 0.681. Outperformed other transformers and CNN+LSTM.
- Proposed approach could help automate detection of undesirable pig behaviors to support animal welfare monitoring and farm management decisions.

In summary, the key innovation is creating a real-world video dataset for pig behavior analysis using deep learning, and benchmarking various techniques with the best results from TimeSformer transformers. This could lead to practical systems to automatically monitor aggression and related behaviors in commercial swine farms.
