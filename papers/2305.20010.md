# [Human or Not? A Gamified Approach to the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20010)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, this white paper does not appear to have a single focused research question or hypothesis. Instead, it provides an overview and analysis of an online social experiment called "Human or Not?" which was designed as a large-scale Turing test. The key elements of the paper are:- Describing the motivation, design principles, and development of the "Human or Not?" game platform. This includes details on the conversational AI bots created to participate in chats.- Presenting initial results and analysis from over 1.5 million users who played the game over one month. This examines the strategies people used to distinguish humans from bots, and bots' abilities to mimic human behavior. - Discussing the limitations of the experiment and its results in terms of generalizability and potential biases.- Drawing insights related to the capabilities of current AI systems, human perceptions of AI, and design of human-AI interactions.So in summary, this paper does not have one focused research question, but rather uses the "Human or Not?" game as a case study to provide a broad analysis of an AI Turing test experiment and its implications. The key goal seems to be presenting the platform itself as a novel way to quantitatively track AI progress in natural language interaction.
