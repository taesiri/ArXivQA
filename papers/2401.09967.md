# [Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding for Boosting Blackbox Large Language   Models without Logit Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09967)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Constrained decoding allows controlling text generation from language models without retraining, by enforcing constraints on the outputs. However, existing methods require access to the language model's next-token logits, which is often not available with large commercial blackbox LLMs.

Proposed Solution - Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding (SGCD):  
- A 2-step approach that works without direct logit access to blackbox LLMs
  - Step 1: A powerful blackbox LLM generates an initial sketch 
  - Step 2: A smaller local model refines the sketch under specified constraints
- Treats the blackbox LLM output as a "sketch" for the local model to elaborate on
- Local model relies on constrained decoding methods to enforce constraints

Key Contributions:
- Enables applying constrained decoding to blackbox LLMs without logit access
- Complements existing constrained decoding techniques 
- Demonstrated to boost performance of blackbox LLMs on complex NLP tasks requiring structured outputs (closed information extraction, constituency parsing)
- Average gains of 10.7% F1 on information extraction, 29.4% F1 on parsing over vanilla blackbox LM decoding
- Precision improves significantly, showing efficacy of constraints 

In summary, the paper introduces a novel two-step approach to apply constrained decoding to blackbox language models, demonstrating performance improvements on tasks needing structured and constrained outputs. The key insight is treating the blackbox LM as an initial sketcher, with a local model subsequently refining its output under constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding (SGCD), a novel method for applying constrained decoding to blackbox large language models without needing access to the models' logits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach called "Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding" (SGCD) for applying constrained decoding to blackbox large language models (LLMs) without requiring access to the models' logits. 

Specifically, SGCD operates in two phases:

1) A powerful blackbox LLM generates a preliminary "sketch" output via unconstrained decoding.

2) A smaller auxiliary model refines the sketch while respecting specified constraints. This constrained refinement is done via access to the auxiliary model's logits.

Thus, SGCD enables the flexibility and control of constrained decoding without needing internal access to the target blackbox LLM. The paper shows through experiments on closed information extraction and constituency parsing that SGCD can significantly enhance the utility of blackbox LLMs on complex NLP tasks requiring structured outputs.

In summary, the core contribution is a novel method to apply constrained decoding to blackbox LLMs by using an auxiliary model to refine the sketches they produce. This expands the applicability of constrained decoding to settings where model transparency is unavailable.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Sketch-guided constrained decoding (SGCD) - The proposed method that utilizes a two-step process involving an initial sketch phase followed by a constrained decoding phase to generate outputs that meet specified constraints, without requiring direct access to model logits.

- Blackbox LLMs - Refers to large language models that are commercially operated and have limited transparency or access, such as not providing access to softmax logits during decoding.

- Open-source LLMs - Refers to openly available LLMs like LLaMA where users have fuller access to model internals. 

- Constrained decoding - A technique to enforce constraints on model outputs without changing model parameters or architectures. Typically relies on logit access.

- Sketching - The initial open-ended generation step in SGCD. Produces a draft output.

- Constrained generation - The second refinement step in SGCD where constraints are applied to rewrite the sketch.

- Information extraction - One of the tasks, involving extracting entity-relation-entity triplets.

- Constituency parsing - The second task, involving generating parse trees that decompose sentence structure.

So in summary, key terms revolve around the proposed SGCD method itself, the types of models involved (blackbox vs open source LLMs), constrained decoding, and the two evaluation tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the proposed Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding (SGCD) method allow constrained decoding to be applied to blackbox LLMs without logit access? What are the key innovations that make this possible?

2. The paper claims SGCD is complementary to existing constrained decoding methods. In what ways does it differ from traditional logit-based techniques? What are some use cases where SGCD would be preferred over other approaches?

3. Explain the two phases of SGCD (sketching and constrained generation) in detail. What is the purpose and implementation of each phase? How do they work together? 

4. What types of constraints can be effectively handled by SGCD? What are some constraints that would be more challenging for this approach? Why?

5. The sketcher LLM generates a preliminary output sketch. What properties must this sketch have for SGCD to be effective? When might the quality of the sketch become a limiting factor?

6. Explain the concept of "degeneration" mentioned in the paper. Under what conditions can this occur and why? How could the likelihood of degeneration be reduced?

7. How was the efficacy of SGCD evaluated in the paper? What were the key results and metrics compared against the baselines? What do these results imply?

8. The paper focuses on closed information extraction and constituency parsing. How could SGCD be applied to other NLP tasks? What considerations would be important?

9. The sketcher LLM used is treated as a blackbox system. If the sketcher provided more transparency into its internal representations, could SGCD be improved further? Why or why not?

10. The paper claims SGCD enables constrained decoding without full model transparency. What are the broader implications of applying constraints to blackbox systems? Could there be risks as well from this approach?
