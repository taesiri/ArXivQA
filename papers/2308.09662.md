# [Red-Teaming Large Language Models using Chain of Utterances for   Safety-Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09662)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a systematic approach to evaluate the safety of large language models against harmful use, and align them to be more responsible?More specifically, the key goals of the paper appear to be:1) Proposing a new red-teaming benchmark called Red-Eval to effectively evaluate the safety of LLMs against harmful questions. 2) Introducing an approach called Red-Instruct for aligning LLMs towards safer and more responsible behavior. This involves:- Constructing a new dataset called HarmfulQA with harmful questions and safe/unsafe conversations. - Using the HarmfulQA dataset to fine-tune models like Vicuna towards safety using strategies to minimize likelihood of harmful responses.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be around developing more rigorous safety evaluation and alignment techniques for LLMs using red teaming and fine-tuning on conversational data. The Red-Eval benchmark and Red-Instruct method are proposed as ways to achieve this.
