# [Red-Teaming Large Language Models using Chain of Utterances for   Safety-Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09662)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a systematic approach to evaluate the safety of large language models against harmful use, and align them to be more responsible?More specifically, the key goals of the paper appear to be:1) Proposing a new red-teaming benchmark called Red-Eval to effectively evaluate the safety of LLMs against harmful questions. 2) Introducing an approach called Red-Instruct for aligning LLMs towards safer and more responsible behavior. This involves:- Constructing a new dataset called HarmfulQA with harmful questions and safe/unsafe conversations. - Using the HarmfulQA dataset to fine-tune models like Vicuna towards safety using strategies to minimize likelihood of harmful responses.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be around developing more rigorous safety evaluation and alignment techniques for LLMs using red teaming and fine-tuning on conversational data. The Red-Eval benchmark and Red-Instruct method are proposed as ways to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a new safety evaluation benchmark called Red-Eval that performs red-teaming to evaluate the safety of large language models against harmful questions. This uses a Chain of Utterances (CoU) prompting approach to jailbreak models.2. Introducing an approach called Red-Instruct for aligning large language models toward safer behavior. This has two main components:- HarmfulQA dataset - A large dataset collected via CoU prompting of ChatGPT. It contains harmful questions across diverse topics and corresponding safe/unsafe conversations. - Safe-Align - Strategies for fine-tuning models on the HarmfulQA dataset to make them safer while preserving utility.3. A safety-aligned large language model called Starling, obtained by fine-tuning Vicuna-7B using the Safe-Align strategies on HarmfulQA data.4. Extensive experiments showing Red-Eval can effectively jailbreak models like GPT-4, Vicuna, StableBeluga etc. Demonstrating Starling is safer on Red-Eval while maintaining utility.In summary, the main contributions are proposing a new red-teaming safety benchmark, a systematic approach for safety alignment using conversational data, and a safer model Starling based on this approach. The key novelty seems to be using CoU prompting for data collection, evaluation and alignment.
