# [Red-Teaming Large Language Models using Chain of Utterances for   Safety-Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09662)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a systematic approach to evaluate the safety of large language models against harmful use, and align them to be more responsible?

More specifically, the key goals of the paper appear to be:

1) Proposing a new red-teaming benchmark called Red-Eval to effectively evaluate the safety of LLMs against harmful questions. 

2) Introducing an approach called Red-Instruct for aligning LLMs towards safer and more responsible behavior. This involves:

- Constructing a new dataset called HarmfulQA with harmful questions and safe/unsafe conversations. 

- Using the HarmfulQA dataset to fine-tune models like Vicuna towards safety using strategies to minimize likelihood of harmful responses.

So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be around developing more rigorous safety evaluation and alignment techniques for LLMs using red teaming and fine-tuning on conversational data. The Red-Eval benchmark and Red-Instruct method are proposed as ways to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a new safety evaluation benchmark called Red-Eval that performs red-teaming to evaluate the safety of large language models against harmful questions. This uses a Chain of Utterances (CoU) prompting approach to jailbreak models.

2. Introducing an approach called Red-Instruct for aligning large language models toward safer behavior. This has two main components:

- HarmfulQA dataset - A large dataset collected via CoU prompting of ChatGPT. It contains harmful questions across diverse topics and corresponding safe/unsafe conversations. 

- Safe-Align - Strategies for fine-tuning models on the HarmfulQA dataset to make them safer while preserving utility.

3. A safety-aligned large language model called Starling, obtained by fine-tuning Vicuna-7B using the Safe-Align strategies on HarmfulQA data.

4. Extensive experiments showing Red-Eval can effectively jailbreak models like GPT-4, Vicuna, StableBeluga etc. Demonstrating Starling is safer on Red-Eval while maintaining utility.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing a new red-teaming safety benchmark, a systematic approach for safety alignment using conversational data, and a safer model Starling based on this approach. The key novelty seems to be using CoU prompting for data collection, evaluation and alignment.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on skimming through the paper, here is a one sentence TL;DR summary:

The paper proposes a new safety evaluation benchmark called Red-Eval and an approach called Red-Instruct for aligning large language models to be more safe and responsible when responding to potentially harmful queries, using a dataset collected via conversational roleplay with ChatGPT.

To expand a bit further:

The key ideas presented in the paper are:

- Red-Eval: A new benchmark to evaluate language model safety by using a "chain of utterances" prompt to try to jailbreak models and tease out harmful responses. 

- Red-Instruct: An approach to make LLMs more safe, involving collecting a dataset called HarmfulQA with harmful questions and safe/unsafe responses from ChatGPT, and using this data to fine-tune models to strengthen guardrails.

- The HarmfulQA dataset has thousands of conversations obtained by prompting ChatGPT to roleplay red teaming itself. 

- Using HarmfulQA, they fine-tune an existing LLM called Vicuna-7B into a safer model called Starling that shows improvements on safety benchmarks while maintaining utility.

So in a nutshell, the paper introduces new techniques to evaluate and improve LLM safety using roleplay data collected from ChatGPT conversations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some points comparing this paper to other research on safety alignment of large language models (LLMs):

- The proposed Red-Eval benchmark for evaluating model safety through red teaming/jailbreaking builds on prior work like Chain of Thought prompting. It demonstrates high attack success rates even on models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT. This emphasizes the need for continued research in systematic security evaluations.

- The HarmfulQA dataset of conversations around harmful topics provides a valuable new resource. Most prior work has smaller sets of isolated harmful questions, without conversational context. 

- The approach of using conversations with a helpful model like ChatGPT to guide safety alignment is novel and promising. It is different from approaches based solely on self-reflection or risky/sensitive datasets.

- Evaluations on safety (HHH, Red-Eval) and utility (TruthfulQA, BBH) cover the key aspects well. Many papers focus on just safety or just capabilities.

- Using Vicuna as the base model to evaluate alignment methods is sensible given its strong capabilities as an open source model. Most alignment work is on older models like GPT-3.

- There is less emphasis here on bias/fairness aspects of safety compared to transparency/accountability. An augmentation with tests like Winogender schema could provide a more holistic ethical AI perspective.

Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions around evaluation methodology and safety alignment data. The experiments also highlight tradeoffs between safety and utility. It fits well with a growing focus in the field on scalable and rigorous methods to address the societal impacts of ever-larger LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different methods for safety alignment such as self-reflection, learning from human feedback, and multi-agent learning. The authors suggest that the proposed approach of learning from an existing conversational agent can be complemented with other alignment techniques.

- Investigating more stable and effective ways of leveraging red team data during training. The authors point out the training instability introduced by their proposed strategy of using red data, and suggest exploring better optimization strategies. 

- Evaluating the proposed methods on much larger language models, as the authors only experimented on a 7B parameter model. Scaling up could provide more insights.

- Constructing more diverse conversational datasets for safety alignment covering additional topics. The authors collected data on 10 topics but suggest expanding this.

- Testing the safety alignment impact of training directly on a model's own generated red/blue conversations instead of an existing system like ChatGPT.

- Evaluating the tradeoffs between safety and capabilities in more detail to understand impact on model performance.

- Exploring the societal impacts and risks of releasing such safety-aligned models.

So in summary, the authors propose further work on the alignment techniques, leveraging red team data, scaling up experiments, generating more diverse conversational data, evaluating tradeoffs, and studying societal impacts as important future directions to build on this research.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here are two paragraphs summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces a new red-teaming benchmark \redevalemoji{} for evaluating the safety of large language models (LLMs) against harmful questions. It uses a Chain of Utterances (CoU) prompt to jailbreak LLMs by subtly teasing out harmful information through a conversation between a harmful agent and an unsafe-helpful agent. The benchmark shows high attack success rates in getting harmful responses from widely used LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4. The paper also proposes a new approach \approach{} for aligning LLMs towards safety. It has two phases - generating a new dataset \dataset{} of harmful questions and safe/unsafe conversations from ChatGPT, and using this data for safety alignment of LLMs like Vicuna-7B to create a new model \starlingemoji{}. Experiments show \starlingemoji{} is safer on red-teaming evaluations while largely preserving utility, demonstrating the value of the proposed approach.

In summary, the key contributions are - (1) \redevalemoji{}, an effective CoU-based benchmark for red-teaming LLMs (2) \approach{} comprising \dataset{} generation from ChatGPT and safety alignment strategies (3) \starlingemoji, a safety-aligned model created by fine-tuning Vicuna-7B on \dataset{}. The paper demonstrates the potential of using CoU prompting and conversational data from existing LLMs like ChatGPT to evaluate safety and align models to be more responsible.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called Red-Instruct for making large language models more safe and responsible. The method has two main phases - first, a conversational dataset called HarmfulQA is constructed by prompting ChatGPT to have conversations containing harmless and harmful responses to unsafe questions across diverse topics. This is done using a Chain of Utterances (CoU) prompting strategy. Second, the HarmfulQA dataset is used to fine-tune the Vicuna language model through a technique called Safe-Align, which involves minimizing the loss for helpful responses in the data while penalizing the model for generating harmful responses. This results in a safety-aligned model called Starling that is evaluated to be safer on proposed red-teaming benchmarks while maintaining performance on truthfulness and utility tasks. The key ideas are leveraging CoU prompting for data collection and using conversational data itself to steer models away from unsafe zones via fine-tuning strategies.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem or question being addressed is: 

How to make large language models safer and more responsibly aligned, particularly in regards to avoiding generating harmful, dangerous, or unethical content.

Specifically, the paper seems to focus on two main issues:

1. Developing better techniques to evaluate the safety of large language models against producing harmful outputs. This includes proposals for a new benchmark called Red-Eval that performs "red teaming" to try to get models to generate unsafe content. 

2. Introducing an approach called Red-Instruct for aligning large language models to be more safe by fine-tuning them on a new dataset called HarmfulQA. This dataset contains conversations demonstrating safe vs unsafe responses to harmful questions.

So in summary, the core problems are around improving safety evaluation of LLMs using red teaming, and aligning LLMs to be safer using a novel fine-tuning approach and dataset. The overall goal appears to be progressing towards more responsible and ethical LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new benchmark for safety evaluation called Red-Eval. How does Red-Eval differ from prior techniques for evaluating model safety, such as the Chain of Thought (CoT) method? What are the key advantages of using a Chain of Utterances (CoU) approach? 

2. The CoU-based prompting approach seems crucial to Red-Eval's ability to jailbreak models. Can you further explain the role of internal thoughts in making the CoU prompts effective? How sensitive is Red-Eval to changes in the phrasing and structure of the prompts?

3. The paper demonstrates Red-Eval's effectiveness in jailbreaking open-source models like Vicuna and StableBeluga. How well does it perform against commercial systems with potentially much larger models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT? Are there any differences to note?

4. For the dataset HarmfulQA, the authors utilize CoU prompting to elicit both "blue" and "red" conversational data from ChatGPT. What is the motivation behind collecting separate harmless and harmful response datasets? How does this support the safety alignment process?

5. The paper proposes two strategies (A and B) for utilizing the HarmfulQA dataset to improve model safety via fine-tuning. Can you walk through the differences between these two strategies? What are the tradeoffs associated with each approach?

6. The resulting safety-aligned model is called Starling. How does Starling compare to the baseline Vicuna-7B model in terms of performance on Red-Eval? What about on other safety benchmarks like HHH?

7. Beyond safety evaluations, does the safety alignment process impact Starling's capabilities on other tasks measuring utility, like TruthfulQA and BIG-Bench? If so, how does the paper characterize this tradeoff between safety and utility?

8. The paper generates conversations using CoU prompting, but does not close the loop by using the model's own outputs for safety alignment. Could an approach based on self-reflection and curriculum learning also work here? What are the potential advantages?

9. For developing real-world systems, what are some of the practical challenges to scaling up the safety alignment techniques proposed in this paper? Would the methodology still be viable for models with hundreds of billions of parameters?

10. How does the notion of safety alignment proposed in this work fit into the broader goal of developing ethical and responsible AI? Could similar techniques apply to aligning models along other dimensions like fairness or transparency?
