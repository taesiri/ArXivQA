# [KG-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Medical QA with Knowledge   Graphs and Ranking Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMa have shown powerful text generation capabilities. However, their application in clinical settings is challenging due to potential deviations from medical facts and inherent biases. 
- Existing methods that incorporate external knowledge bases into LLMs risk introducing irrelevant or unreliable information, compromising effectiveness and raising issues of credibility, consistency, privacy, security and legality.
- A key open question is: How to better integrate external knowledge base content into LLMs?

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose KG-Rank, a framework to integrate a structured medical knowledge graph into existing pre-trained LLMs to achieve more accurate medical question answering. 
- They first retrieve related one-hop relations from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge graph.
- They then apply ranking and re-ranking methods to optimize the ordering of retrieved triplets to filter irrelevant data, highlight key information, ensure diversity and boost factuality.
- The top-ranked triplets are input along with the question into the LLM to generate the answer.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first application of ranking models combined with knowledge graphs for long-answer medical QA using LLMs.  
- Incorporates ranking techniques to improve factuality and reduce noise/redundancy in the knowledge retrieval process.
- Achieves over 18% improvement in ROUGE-L score on medical QA datasets and 14% on open-domain QA dataset.
- Demonstrates KG-Rank's effectiveness and potential beyond just the medical domain.

In summary, KG-Rank is an augmented LLM framework that leverages a medical knowledge graph integrated via optimized ranking techniques to significantly enhance the accuracy of free-text question answering in both medical and open domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes KG-Rank, an augmented large language model framework that leverages a medical knowledge graph and ranking techniques to improve question answering accuracy in the medical domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose KG-Rank, a novel framework that integrates a structured medical knowledge graph into existing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to achieve more accurate medical question answering. 

2) They incorporate ranking techniques to improve factuality and eliminate noise and redundancy from the knowledge graph retrieval stage. Specifically, they introduce three ranking methods - similarity ranking, answer expansion ranking, and maximal marginal relevance ranking.

3) They also develop re-ranking methods using a medical cross-encoder model to further refine the ordering of the most relevant knowledge graph triplets. 

4) They demonstrate the effectiveness of KG-Rank on four medical QA datasets, achieving over 18% improvement in ROUGE-L score. They also extend it to open domains and achieve 14% higher ROUGE-L.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel KG-enhanced LLM framework called KG-Rank that integrates ranking models with knowledge graphs to significantly boost performance on medical and open domain QA tasks requiring long, free-text answers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What were the motivations for proposing the Knowledge Graph Rank model specifically for medical question answering? How is it better suited than previous methods involving knowledge graphs?

2. Why is ranking of knowledge graph triplets important in this model? In what ways can irrelevant or unreliable triplets negatively impact the performance if not properly filtered?

3. Explain the similarity ranking, answer expansion ranking, and MMR ranking methods in detail. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each? Which seems to perform the best overall?  

4. What customizations were made to leverage the UMLS knowledge graph? What are some key properties and statistics of UMLS that make it well-suited for this medical QA task?

5. The re-ranking stage uses a medical cross-encoder model. Why is a specialized medical model better than a generic model like Cohere? What types of mistakes does a generic model make?

6. Walk through the case study example step-by-step. How does the KG-Rank answer differ from the original? Why is the KG-Rank answer more medically accurate in this case?

7. Discuss the prompt engineering techniques involved in the different stages of Knowledge Graph retrieval, ranking, and answer generation. How do the prompts provide useful guidance? 

8. How was the model extended to open domains using Wikipedia and DBpedia? What changes were required compared to the medical version? How much improvement was achieved?

9. What are some limitations of the current KG-Rank model and areas of future work? What additional evaluations could be done to further validate performance?  

10. Does the KG-Rank model have the potential to reduce gender, racial, or other biases in large language model outputs? Why or why not? What additional bias mitigation techniques could be explored?
