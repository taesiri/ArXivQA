# [Cross-Validation Is All You Need: A Statistical Approach To Label Noise   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13990)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to identify and remove label noise/errors in machine learning datasets, particularly for outcome prediction tasks like survival analysis. The key hypotheses are:1) The performance fluctuations across cross-validation folds are influenced by label noise, with noisy samples appearing more often in worst-performing folds. 2) Repeated cross-validations can generate a "noise histogram" that captures the distribution of label noise and allows identification of noisy samples.3) Removing noisy samples identified by the proposed ReCoV approach can improve model performance and generalizability.The paper proposes and evaluates the ReCoV method to address the problem of label noise in both classification and outcome prediction tasks. The experiments on benchmark and medical imaging datasets aim to test the above hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Repeated Cross-Validations (ReCoV), a simple but effective statistical approach for estimating label noise in machine learning datasets. The key ideas of ReCoV are:- It generates a "noise histogram" by recording which samples appear in the worst-performing fold across many repeated cross-validations. The hypothesis is that noisy samples will tend to appear in the worst folds more often. - The noise histogram can be used to identify potential noisy/outlier samples in the training data without relying on any assumptions about the type of label noise. - ReCoV is model-agnostic and can work with any machine learning task, including complex cases like survival analysis where noise distributions are not straightforward.- Experiments show ReCoV can identify artificially injected label noise with high accuracy in a classification benchmark. More importantly, removing ReCoV-identified noisy samples significantly improves model test performance in two medical imaging survival analysis tasks.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a simple statistical approach using repeated cross-validation to estimate label noise/outliers and showing it is effective across different machine learning scenarios. ReCoV provides a model-agnostic way to improve model generalization by cleansing noisy training data.
