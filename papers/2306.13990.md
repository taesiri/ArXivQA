# [Cross-Validation Is All You Need: A Statistical Approach To Label Noise   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13990)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to identify and remove label noise/errors in machine learning datasets, particularly for outcome prediction tasks like survival analysis. The key hypotheses are:1) The performance fluctuations across cross-validation folds are influenced by label noise, with noisy samples appearing more often in worst-performing folds. 2) Repeated cross-validations can generate a "noise histogram" that captures the distribution of label noise and allows identification of noisy samples.3) Removing noisy samples identified by the proposed ReCoV approach can improve model performance and generalizability.The paper proposes and evaluates the ReCoV method to address the problem of label noise in both classification and outcome prediction tasks. The experiments on benchmark and medical imaging datasets aim to test the above hypotheses.
