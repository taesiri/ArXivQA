# [Discovering Behavioral Modes in Deep Reinforcement Learning Policies   Using Trajectory Clustering in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12939)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents is challenging due to the complexity and opacity of their neural network policies. This lack of interpretability hinders improving agent performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a novel approach to investigate and understand DRL agent behaviors by examining their learned policies through unsupervised learning. Specifically, it utilizes dimensionality reduction and trajectory clustering in the latent space of DRL network policies.

- The methodology first uses Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PaCMAP) to reduce the dimensionality of the latent space trajectories while preserving local and global structure. Then it applies TRACLUS, a trajectory clustering algorithm, to discern distinct behavior modes of the agent's policy. 

- Behavior modes refer to consistent approaches or tactics to specific situations or states that the agent encounters. Trajectories over time are clustered to capture comprehensive behavioral patterns.

- The approach is demonstrated on a DRL policy trained with Soft Actor-Critic on the Mountain Car control task. By visualizing the state space trajectory clusters, the policy's strategy and suboptimal behaviors are revealed.

Main Contributions:

- Employs PaCMAP, a state-of-the-art dimension reduction method, to reduce the dimensionality of the DRL policy latent space before trajectory clustering.

- Uses TRACLUS to cluster trajectories within the latent space of the policy to identify behavioral modes of the DRL agent.

- Interprets and classifies resulting clusters for behavior analysis across different parts of the environment's state space.  

- Detects regions of suboptimal performance by the policy using domain knowledge and the behavior clusters. Shows targeted improvements to the policy for these regions.

- Introduces a novel application of trajectory clustering in DRL policy latent spaces to understand and improve agent behaviors.

In summary, the paper presents a new explainability methodology for DRL policies that leverages trajectory clustering in the latent space. By revealing insights into an agent's learned behaviors, targeted performance improvements can be made.
