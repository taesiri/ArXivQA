# [Measuring Policy Distance for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11257)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of general metrics to quantify policy differences between agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Such a metric would help analyze diversity evolution, provide guidance for designing diversity-based MARL algorithms, and balance between policy diversity and parameter sharing.  

- Directly comparing action distributions has limitations related to distribution types and fails to satisfy triangle inequality. Simply mapping policies to low-dimensional vectors results in significant information loss. Existing methods have constraints on policy types or action/observation spaces.

Proposed Solution:

- Propose MAPD to measure policy distance between agent pairs. Learn latent conditional representations of agents' decisions using autoencoder architecture. Compute policy distance by integrating distribution distances between learned representations.

- Extend MAPD to customized version to quantify differences in specific behavioral aspects based on customized features from env/agents. Customized MAPD uses similar methodology but predicts distribution of customized features.

- Design MADPS for dynamic parameter sharing in MARL using online MAPD deployment. Conduct policy fusion and division based on distance thresholds to balance diversity and sharing.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposing MAPD as a general tool to measure policy differences in MARL based on learned conditional representations.

2) Developing customizable MAPD to quantify differences in certain policy aspects.  

3) Designing MADPS, a dynamic parameter sharing MARL algorithm, as an application example of MAPD.

4) Demonstrating MAPD's effectiveness in analyzing diversity and MADPS's superior performance compared to other parameter sharing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-agent policy distance (MAPD) method to measure differences between agent policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning, and applies it to design a dynamic parameter sharing algorithm that balances policy diversity and sharing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MAPD, a generalized method to measure the policy difference between agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing MAPD, a generalized measure of policy differences for multi-agent reinforcement learning. 

2) Developing a customizable version of MAPD for measuring policy differences on specific aspects.

3) Designing MADPS, a multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm based on the online deployment of MAPD.

4) Demonstrating the utilization of MAPD through cases in multi-agent particle environments and applying MADPS on both simple environments and StarCraft II to showcase its superior performance.

The paper argues that there is a lack of general metrics to quantify policy differences in MARL, which is important for understanding the role of diversity and guiding the design of diversity-based MARL algorithms. MAPD addresses this by learning conditional representations of agent decisions rather than directly comparing action distributions. The customizable MAPD further allows measuring differences in specific aspects of policies. Based on MAPD, the paper proposes MADPS as a way to dynamically adjust parameter sharing during training to balance diversity and efficiency. Experiments show MAPD can effectively measure policy differences and MADPS outperforms other parameter sharing methods.

The paper proposes a method called MAPD to measure policy differences between agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning. It learns a conditional representation of agent's decisions and uses distribution distances between these latent representations to quantify policy differences. The paper also introduces a customized version of MAPD to measure differences in specific behavioral aspects. As an application, the paper designs a dynamic parameter sharing algorithm called MADPS that leverages MAPD to balance diversity and sharing. Experiments are conducted in multi-agent particle environments and StarCraft II to demonstrate the effectiveness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learning a conditional representation of the agent's decisions rather than directly comparing action distributions. What is the rationale behind this idea? What limitations exist in directly comparing action distributions?

2. The autoencoder framework is used to learn the conditional representation. Explain the reasoning behind the specific design of the encoder and decoder. Why is the action distribution used as input rather than action samples?  

3. Discuss the loss function defined in Equation 1. Why is the KL divergence term incorporated in addition to the reconstruction loss? What is the effect of bringing the latent distribution closer to the prior?

4. The computation of MAPD in Equation 2 relies on a subset of the observation space O'. Explain how this subset is determined and why focusing only on relevant observations enables tractable computation.

5. Customized policy distance is introduced to measure differences in certain behavioral aspects. Define what constitutes a customized feature and discuss how the methodology relates to the normal MAPD computation.

6. The multi-agent spread environment is used as a case study. Propose other potential multi-agent environments where customized policy distance would provide additional insights over normal MAPD.

7. Dynamic parameter sharing balances policy diversity and sharing. Explain why directly comparing policy distances to thresholds can result in contradictions when fusing/dividing parameters for multiple agents. 

8. Discuss the reasoning behind the design choice of only fusing/dividing a portion of network parameters during each operation in MADPS. What is the effect of this decision?

9. Why does MAPD better enable online computation of policy distances during training compared to prior policy difference metrics? How does this facilitate the design of MADPS?

10. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of MADPS over baselines. Analyze specific environments where the benefits of dynamic adjustment of parameter sharing manifest.
