# [Prompting Visual-Language Models for Efficient Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04478)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we effectively adapt powerful image-based visual-language (I-VL) models that are pre-trained on large amounts of web data to solve novel video understanding tasks with minimal additional training? The key ideas proposed in the paper to address this question are:1) Use "continuous prompt vectors" that are optimized during training to convert video tasks into the same format as the pre-training objectives of the I-VL model. This allows adapting the model to new tasks by only training the small set of prompt vectors rather than the full model.2) Add lightweight temporal modeling on top of the frozen I-VL image encoder using Transformers. This encodes temporal information from the frame sequences to help the image-based model better understand videos. 3) Formulate various video tasks like action recognition, localization, and text-video retrieval under the same framework of similarity matching between visual and textual embeddings. This enables training one shared model backbone for different tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by optimizing small prompt vectors and temporal Transformers on top of a frozen large-scale pre-trained I-VL model, we can efficiently adapt these models to solve novel video tasks with minimal training. The experiments aim to validate if this approach is effective across different video understanding scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a simple yet effective method to adapt image-based visual language (I-VL) models like CLIP to video understanding tasks. Specifically, it uses "continuous prompt vectors" to convert different video tasks into the same format as the pre-training objective. 2. It adds lightweight Transformers on top of frame-wise visual features from CLIP to model temporal information in videos. This helps bridge the gap between static images and videos.3. It evaluates the approach extensively on 10 video benchmarks across different scenarios - closed-set, few-shot, and zero-shot for action recognition, localization and text-video retrieval. Despite optimizing far fewer parameters, it shows competitive or state-of-the-art performance.4. It provides comprehensive ablation studies and analysis on the key components like prompt learning and temporal modeling. This establishes strong baselines for efficient video understanding by adapting image-based models.In summary, the main contribution is an efficient and lightweight method to adapt powerful pre-trained I-VL models to video tasks by optimizing only a few prompt vectors and Transformer layers. This shows promising performance across different benchmarks while being highly parameter-efficient.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to efficiently adapt pre-trained image-text CLIP models for video understanding tasks like action recognition, localization and retrieval, by optimizing only a small number of "prompt" vectors and lightweight temporal transformers while keeping the CLIP model fixed.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in efficient video understanding:- This paper focuses on adapting pre-trained image-based visual-language (I-VL) models like CLIP to video tasks through prompt learning. Other work like ActionCLIP and CLIP4Clip finetunes the full I-VL model end-to-end on video, which is more computationally expensive. - For action recognition, this paper achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods while training far fewer parameters. Other work like TimeSformer and X3D achieves top performance but requires full model finetuning and training.- For few-shot and zero-shot recognition, this paper significantly outperforms previous methods by learning prompt vectors. Other few-shot work like TARN and TRX do not leverage large-scale pre-trained I-VL models.- For action localization, this paper adapts I-VL models using proposals and prompt learning. Other work like AFSD leverages proposals but requires finetuning RGB and optical flow streams.- For text-video retrieval, this paper's prompting approach achieves strong performance compared to specialized methods like MDMMT. Other work like Frozen and CLIP4Clip finetunes the full I-VL model end-to-end.In summary, a key distinction of this work is the efficiency of adapting I-VL models to video tasks through prompt learning rather than full finetuning. This enables competitive performance across several benchmarks while training far fewer parameters. The trade-off is that specialized video architectures finetuned end-to-end can still achieve higher accuracy.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the prompt learning idea to other pre-trained visual-language models besides CLIP, such as ALIGN, FILIP, etc. The authors state this technique should be applicable to other models as well.- Exploring different prompt formats and optimisation techniques to further improve efficiency and performance. The authors tested prepend/append but other prompt designs could be explored.- Applying prompt learning to other video understanding tasks beyond recognition, localization and retrieval tested in this paper. For example, video captioning, action segmentation, etc.- Developing better techniques to model temporal information and motion dynamics building on top of powerful image-text models. The authors note their simple temporal Transformer has limitations for fine-grained motion modeling.- Pre-training visual-language models directly on aligned video-text pairs at scale, instead of image-text pairs as in CLIP, to better capture temporal information. But note this is much more expensive.- Studying zero-shot generalization across tasks in addition to categories. For example, training on recognition and testing on retrieval in a zero-shot manner.- Mitigating biases in pre-trained models from web-crawled data.- Exploring prompt learning for multimodal understanding tasks beyond just video, such as embodied AI.In summary, the core suggestions are around extending prompt learning to new models, tasks, and data; improving temporal/motion modeling; and studying new transfer learning capabilities enabled by prompt tuning of visual-language models.
