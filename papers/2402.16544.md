# [Label Learning Method Based on Tensor Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing anchor graph-based multi-view clustering methods either require additional clustering techniques which are time-consuming, or try to learn bipartite graphs with K connected components which has high parameter requirements and may fail in some cases. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Label Learning Method based on Tensor Projection (LLMTP) which projects the anchor graphs into the label space to obtain cluster labels directly without any post-processing. Specifically:

1) The anchor graph is viewed as a feature matrix and projected into a label space using an orthogonal projection matrix to get cluster labels directly. 

2) To better utilize complementary information across views, the matrix projection is extended to tensor projection to project a multi-view anchor graph tensor instead of view-wise projection. 

3) Tensor Schatten p-norm regularization is introduced to enforce consensus between projected label matrices of different views.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes to project anchor graphs to label space to avoid post-processing and bipartite graph learning.

2) Extends matrix projection to tensor projection to fully utilize spatial structure information between views. 

3) Introduces tensor Schatten p-norm regularization for exploring complementary information across views.

4) Develops an optimization algorithm and proves its convergence experimentally.

5) Conducts extensive experiments to demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering performance.
