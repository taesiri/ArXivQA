# [Impact of spatial transformations on landscape features of CEC2022 basic   benchmark problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07654)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- When benchmarking optimization algorithms, it is important to avoid bias where algorithms exploit specific properties of benchmark problems. One way to mitigate this is by generating different instances of each problem while preserving fundamental properties.
- However, the impact of spatial transformations used for instance generation on low-level landscape features is not well understood. 

Methods:
- The authors investigate spatial transformations such as translation, scaling, rotation and their impact on landscape features of 5 continuous benchmark problems from the CEC2022 suite. 
- They compute 55 landscape features from the flacco ELA library on 267 transformed instances per function, using Latin hypercube sampling.
- Dimensionality reduction, statistical tests and difference measures are used to analyze the feature value changes.  

Key Findings:
- Even small transformations like minor translations or rotations cause statistically significant changes in many landscape features.  
- The impact scales with the disruptiveness of the transformations. Larger translations and scaling factors linearly alter landscape features.
- Very few features like the PCA-based ones are invariant to domain transformations. Many information content and model-based features are impacted.
- There is a need to better understand the link between intuitive problem properties, low-level landscape features and algorithm performance to design appropriate instance generation methods.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of spatial transformations on the landscape features of CEC2022 benchmark problems 
- Identified transformations that significantly alter local landscape properties
- Showed landscape features expected to be invariant are actually sensitive
- Highlighted the need for more research on relating landscape features to algorithm performance for robust instance generation

The work provides valuable insights into designing unbiased benchmark suites using spatial transformations while preserving relevant landscape properties.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the impact of spatial transformations such as translation, scaling, and rotation on the low-level landscape features of 5 continuous optimization benchmark problems from the CEC2022 suite, finding that even small transformations can significantly alter many of the 55 ELA features considered.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an analysis of the impact of various spatial transformations on the low-level landscape features of 5 problems from the CEC2022 benchmark suite. Specifically:

- The paper considers translations, scalings, rotations, and transformations of the objective function value (translations and scalings). These transformations are applied to the 5 CEC2022 problems with different parameters.

- For each transformed problem instance, the values of 55 ELA features are calculated based on Latin hypercube sampling. This results in a large dataset of feature values across different spatial transformations. 

- Dimensionality reduction and statistical tests are used to analyze how the distribution of ELA features changes under different transformations. Results show that even small transformations can significantly alter many landscape features.

- The sensitivity of each ELA feature to different transformations is aggregated and analyzed. Very few features are completely invariant to all transformations. Many features are impacted by transformations applied to the search space.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive analysis of how spatial transformations influence low-level landscape features on a standard benchmark set. This sheds light on the sensitivity of these features and poses questions about how to properly generate benchmark instances without significantly altering the optimization landscape.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Benchmarking - The paper investigates benchmark problems and how spatial transformations impact their features. Benchmarking is used to evaluate optimization algorithms.

- Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) - The paper analyzes how spatial transformations impact the low-level landscape features of optimization problems, as measured by ELA.

- Spatial transformations - The paper studies translation, scaling, and rotation transformations applied to the search space and objective function.

- Feature stability - A key aspect examined is how stable various ELA features are under different spatial transformations.

- Instance generation - Generating multiple instances of benchmark problems is important to avoid bias. The paper studies spatial transformations that could be used for instance generation.

- CEC2022 - The paper uses the CEC2022 benchmark problem suite as a testbed for studying the impact of spatial transformations.

- Landscape features - Specifically, the impact on commonly used ELA features that characterize the optimization landscape.

- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test - Used to statistically test if transformations impact distributions of ELA features. 

- Earth Mover's Distance - Used to quantify differences between ELA feature distributions.

So in summary, key terms cover benchmarking, ELA analysis, spatial transformations, instance generation, feature stability, statistical tests, and the CEC2022 problems.
