# [InstructPix2Pix: Learning to Follow Image Editing Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09800)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we train a generative model to edit images according to textual instructions, without needing labels that directly pair images and editing instructions?The key points are:- Image editing from textual instructions is an important and useful capability, but lacks paired training data of images and editing instructions. - The authors propose generating a large paired dataset by combining two pretrained generative models - GPT-3 for text and Stable Diffusion for images. - GPT-3 is finetuned to convert image captions to editing instructions and edited captions. Stable Diffusion converts caption pairs to image pairs.- This generated dataset is used to train InstructPix2Pix, a conditional diffusion model for image editing.- At inference time, InstructPix2Pix can edit real images according to user-provided instructions, despite being trained only on synthetic data.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that generating a large paired dataset with other generative models can enable training an instruction-following image editor without real human-annotated data. The key contribution is the proposed training data generation and model training process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a method to generate a large paired dataset for instruction-based image editing by combining two pretrained models: a language model (GPT-3) and a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion). The language model is finetuned to generate editing instructions and modified captions, while the text-to-image model converts caption pairs to image pairs. - Training a conditional diffusion model called InstructPix2Pix on the generated paired dataset. This model takes as input an image and a textual instruction describing how to edit that image. It can perform a diverse range of edits including replacing objects, changing artistic style/medium, modifying attributes, etc.- Demonstrating that despite being trained on synthetic data, InstructPix2Pix generalizes to editing real images from human-written instructions at test time. The model directly performs the edit in the forward pass without needing per-example fine-tuning or inversion.- Analyzing the model quantitatively and qualitatively, comparing it to baseline editing approaches, and performing ablations. The results show it can perform a wide variety of edits not possible with other text-based editing methods.In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing a novel approach to generate training data for instruction-based image editing, and using this data to train a model that can generalize to editing real images from natural language instructions. The method sidesteps the lack of human-annotated training data for this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method to train a conditional diffusion model to edit images according to text instructions, by first using GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion to generate a large training dataset of image pairs and corresponding text edits.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on instruction-based image editing:- The method of generating training data is novel. Most prior work trains directly on real human-generated data. This paper instead uses large pretrained language and image models to synthesize a large training dataset. This allows training a model for a very data-hungry task (image editing) without expensive data collection.- The model performs edits in the forward pass without per-example fine-tuning or optimization. Many prior methods like GAN inversion and optimization-based editing require optimizing the edit for each image, which is slow. This model can edit new images very quickly.- The instructions specify what edit to make rather than describing the full input or output image. This is more flexible than methods that require a full caption since the user only needs to tell the model what to change. The model does not need extra context.- The method uses a conditional diffusion model. Most prior text-to-image and text-guided editing methods are based on GANs. Diffusion models have been less explored for image editing tasks.- The model is able to generalize to real images and user instructions despite training only on synthetic data. Most text-conditional image editing methods require real image data for training.So in summary, the key innovations are in data synthesis, the editing model architecture, and the use of instructions rather than full descriptions. The paper shows diffusion models conditioned on both an image and text can learn to follow editing instructions and generalize well.
