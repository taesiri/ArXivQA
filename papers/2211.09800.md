# [InstructPix2Pix: Learning to Follow Image Editing Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09800)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we train a generative model to edit images according to textual instructions, without needing labels that directly pair images and editing instructions?The key points are:- Image editing from textual instructions is an important and useful capability, but lacks paired training data of images and editing instructions. - The authors propose generating a large paired dataset by combining two pretrained generative models - GPT-3 for text and Stable Diffusion for images. - GPT-3 is finetuned to convert image captions to editing instructions and edited captions. Stable Diffusion converts caption pairs to image pairs.- This generated dataset is used to train InstructPix2Pix, a conditional diffusion model for image editing.- At inference time, InstructPix2Pix can edit real images according to user-provided instructions, despite being trained only on synthetic data.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that generating a large paired dataset with other generative models can enable training an instruction-following image editor without real human-annotated data. The key contribution is the proposed training data generation and model training process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a method to generate a large paired dataset for instruction-based image editing by combining two pretrained models: a language model (GPT-3) and a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion). The language model is finetuned to generate editing instructions and modified captions, while the text-to-image model converts caption pairs to image pairs. - Training a conditional diffusion model called InstructPix2Pix on the generated paired dataset. This model takes as input an image and a textual instruction describing how to edit that image. It can perform a diverse range of edits including replacing objects, changing artistic style/medium, modifying attributes, etc.- Demonstrating that despite being trained on synthetic data, InstructPix2Pix generalizes to editing real images from human-written instructions at test time. The model directly performs the edit in the forward pass without needing per-example fine-tuning or inversion.- Analyzing the model quantitatively and qualitatively, comparing it to baseline editing approaches, and performing ablations. The results show it can perform a wide variety of edits not possible with other text-based editing methods.In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing a novel approach to generate training data for instruction-based image editing, and using this data to train a model that can generalize to editing real images from natural language instructions. The method sidesteps the lack of human-annotated training data for this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method to train a conditional diffusion model to edit images according to text instructions, by first using GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion to generate a large training dataset of image pairs and corresponding text edits.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on instruction-based image editing:- The method of generating training data is novel. Most prior work trains directly on real human-generated data. This paper instead uses large pretrained language and image models to synthesize a large training dataset. This allows training a model for a very data-hungry task (image editing) without expensive data collection.- The model performs edits in the forward pass without per-example fine-tuning or optimization. Many prior methods like GAN inversion and optimization-based editing require optimizing the edit for each image, which is slow. This model can edit new images very quickly.- The instructions specify what edit to make rather than describing the full input or output image. This is more flexible than methods that require a full caption since the user only needs to tell the model what to change. The model does not need extra context.- The method uses a conditional diffusion model. Most prior text-to-image and text-guided editing methods are based on GANs. Diffusion models have been less explored for image editing tasks.- The model is able to generalize to real images and user instructions despite training only on synthetic data. Most text-conditional image editing methods require real image data for training.So in summary, the key innovations are in data synthesis, the editing model architecture, and the use of instructions rather than full descriptions. The paper shows diffusion models conditioned on both an image and text can learn to follow editing instructions and generalize well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Improving the model's ability to follow instructions for spatial reasoning and counting numbers of objects. The current model struggles with instructions like "move it to the left of the image" or "put two cups on the table". Developing better spatial and counting capabilities could help address these limitations.- Incorporating human feedback to improve alignment between the model and human intentions. The authors suggest human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning as one approach to incorporate feedback. This could help the model better interpret instructions the way a human user intends.- Reducing the need for per-example tuning of the classifier-free guidance weights. Currently, the authors tune these weights for each example to get the best results. Methods to reduce this per-example tuning could improve the usability.- Exploring the use of instructions in combination with other modalities like user interaction. For example, combining instructions with some form of user input like sketches or spatial constraints could expand the editing capabilities.- Developing better evaluation metrics and benchmarks for instruction-based image editing. Appropriate evaluation metrics could better measure progress in capabilities like spatial reasoning and following instructions precisely.- Mitigating biases inherited from the model's training data and foundations. As a generated dataset is used for training, any biases propagate to the model. Methods to understand and mitigate biases will be important.- Pushing the limits on fidelity and resolution of the generated imagery. This could expand the types of edits possible and overall visual quality.Overall, the authors point to improving spatial reasoning, incorporating feedback, reducing per-example tuning, combining modalities, benchmarking progress, mitigating biases, and improving image quality as important directions for advancing instruction-based image editing.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method for editing images from human instructions. The key idea is to first generate a large paired dataset of image editing examples by combining two pretrained models: GPT-3 for generating text instructions and edited captions, and Stable Diffusion for generating corresponding images from the text. This generated dataset is then used to train InstructPix2Pix, a conditional diffusion model for image editing. At inference time, InstructPix2Pix takes as input a real image and a user-written instruction specifying how to edit that image. It performs the edit directly in the forward pass without needing per-example inversion or fine-tuning. Despite being trained on synthetic data, InstructPix2Pix generalizes to real images and human instructions. Results demonstrate it can perform a diverse variety of edits such as changing artistic style/medium, replacing objects, modifying attributes, etc. A main benefit of the instruction-based interface is users can intuitively tell the model what edit to perform without describing the full input or output. The method represents an approach for generating paired training data by combining complementary abilities of multiple pretrained models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper: The paper proposes a method for editing images according to human-written instructions. The key idea is to leverage two large pretrained models, a language model (GPT-3) and an image generator (Stable Diffusion), to create a synthetic dataset of image-text pairs for training. Specifically, GPT-3 is finetuned to generate text instructions for editing images given an initial image description. The text instructions and edited descriptions are then fed into Stable Diffusion to create corresponding image pairs. This synthetic dataset is used to train InstructPix2Pix, a conditional diffusion model for image editing. At inference time, InstructPix2Pix takes in a real image and a human-written instruction and edits the image accordingly in one forward pass, without needing additional images or per-example fine-tuning. The model utilizes classifier-free guidance during training and inference to balance consistency with the input image and faithfulness to the editing instruction. Experiments demonstrate that despite being trained only on synthetic data, InstructPix2Pix generalizes well to real images and arbitrary user instructions. The model performs a diverse range of challenging edits involving style, objects, context, artistic medium, and more. Limitations include inability to make viewpoint or spatial changes. Overall, the work presents a novel approach to dataset creation and a promising conditional diffusion model for intuitive image editing via natural language instructions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a method for teaching a generative model to edit images according to human-written instructions. Since large-scale paired data of images and editing instructions is difficult to obtain, the authors take a data generation approach. They leverage two pretrained models operating on different modalities - the GPT-3 language model and the Stable Diffusion text-to-image model. GPT-3 is finetuned to generate plausible text editing instructions and edited image captions from input image captions. These instruction-caption pairs are then fed to Stable Diffusion using the Prompt-to-Prompt technique, which aligns the generated image pairs to match the text changes. This results in a large paired dataset of images and text instructions for editing those images. This generated dataset is then used to train a conditional diffusion model called InstructPix2Pix, which takes an input image and text instruction and directly outputs the edited image. At test time, this model can edit real images using natural human instructions, despite being trained only on synthetic data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem the authors are trying to address is how to edit images according to textual instructions. Specifically, they aim to develop a method where a model can take as input an image and a text instruction describing how to edit that image (e.g. "make this black and white", "replace the dog with a cat"), and output the edited image accordingly. Some key challenges they identify in developing such a method include:- Lack of large paired datasets containing images and corresponding textual editing instructions to train models.- Difficulty in isolating specific objects/regions in an image to edit based on free-form textual instructions. - Generalizing to arbitrary real images at test time after training only on synthetic data.To address these challenges, their main technical contributions are:- A method to generate a large training dataset by combining a language model (GPT-3) and image generation model (Stable Diffusion).- A conditional diffusion model, InstructPix2Pix, trained on this generated dataset to perform image editing from instructions.- Techniques like classifier-free guidance to help isolate edits and trade off image consistency vs edit accuracy.So in summary, the key problem is developing a model that can follow free-form textual instructions to edit arbitrary real images, which requires overcoming challenges in obtaining suitable training data and generalizing beyond that training data. The authors propose both data generation techniques and a novel diffusion model to make progress on this problem.
