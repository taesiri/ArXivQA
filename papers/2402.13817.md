# [Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in   Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments":

Problem:
- Robots operating in human environments need to build spatio-temporal models capturing both short-term dynamics (e.g. people moving) and long-term changes (e.g. furniture rearrangement). 
- Existing works focus on either short-term motion tracking or long-term change detection, but a unified framework is missing.
- The goal is to develop a system that incrementally builds a dense metric-semantic model of the world across time during robot operation.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM (SMS-SLAM) problem for jointly estimating robot poses, a semantic map, and its evolution over time.
- Propose a novel factorization based on the idea of spatio-temporal local consistency to decompose the problem into (i) tracking short-term dynamics, (ii) detecting long-term changes, and (iii) a SLAM backbone. 
- Present an efficient system called Khronos with three main components:
   - Active Window: Tracks fragments (object observations) locally over time
   - Global Optimization: Estimates robot pose graph and fragment poses 
   - Reconciliation: Combines fragments into full object estimates over time
- Khronos builds a 4D spatio-temporal map capturing both short and long term dynamics.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the SMS-SLAM problem for spatio-temporal mapping
- A novel factorization providing a unified view on short and long term dynamics
- Khronos - the first real-time system for metric-semantic spatio-temporal SLAM
- Significantly outperforms prior work in capturing dynamics and changes
- Validation on simulated and real datasets with different robot platforms
