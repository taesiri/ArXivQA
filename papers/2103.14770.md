# [Categorical Representation Learning: Morphism is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14770)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can the mathematical framework of category theory be applied to develop new machine learning approaches for representation learning and translating between datasets? Specifically, the paper aims to show:1) How categorical representation learning can be used to learn feature representations of objects and relations (morphisms) in a dataset. 2) How functorial learning can align the categorical structures between datasets to enable unsupervised or semi-supervised translation. 3) How tensor categories can be used to discover hierarchical structures and simplify categorical representations via renormalization.The overall goal is to demonstrate that a category theory perspective, with its focus on objects and morphisms, can lead to novel and potentially more effective techniques for representation learning compared to standard approaches. The authors provide preliminary results on a chemical compound dataset to showcase the potential of their categorical learning framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel framework called "categorical representation learning" for machine learning. This framework represents objects as vectors and relations between objects as matrices, capturing the categorical structure in datasets. 2. It introduces the concept of "categorifier" which learns representations of objects and morphisms (relations) from data statistics. The key idea is to model linking probabilities between objects based on their concurrence statistics in data.3. It develops "functorial learning" to align categorical structures and establish functors between datasets. This enables unsupervised or semi-supervised translation by matching the relations between objects.4. It combines categorical representation learning and functorial learning in tensor categories to discover hierarchical structures in data via renormalization group transformations. This allows simplifying complex categorical structures in a multi-scale fashion.5. As a proof of concept, it applies the framework to an inorganic chemical compound dataset and demonstrates superior performance compared to standard deep learning models in a semi-supervised translation task, using 17 times fewer parameters.In summary, the key novelty is the categorical representation learning approach and its applications enabled by modeling relations as matrices within a category theory framework. This provides a new perspective compared to standard deep learning models based on encoding objects as vectors. The overall framework offers a powerful new paradigm for representation learning across various tasks.
