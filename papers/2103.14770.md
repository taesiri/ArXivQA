# [Categorical Representation Learning: Morphism is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14770)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can the mathematical framework of category theory be applied to develop new machine learning approaches for representation learning and translating between datasets? Specifically, the paper aims to show:1) How categorical representation learning can be used to learn feature representations of objects and relations (morphisms) in a dataset. 2) How functorial learning can align the categorical structures between datasets to enable unsupervised or semi-supervised translation. 3) How tensor categories can be used to discover hierarchical structures and simplify categorical representations via renormalization.The overall goal is to demonstrate that a category theory perspective, with its focus on objects and morphisms, can lead to novel and potentially more effective techniques for representation learning compared to standard approaches. The authors provide preliminary results on a chemical compound dataset to showcase the potential of their categorical learning framework.
