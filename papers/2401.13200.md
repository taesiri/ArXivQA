# [Topology-aware Embedding Memory for Learning on Expanding Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13200)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Continual learning aims to learn new tasks sequentially without forgetting previous ones. Applying continual learning to graph data presents a key challenge of preserving the topological information with tractable memory consumption. Message passing GNNs require storing the computation ego-subgraphs for replay, incurring intractable space complexity of O(nd^L), where n is the memory budget, d is the average node degree and L is the radius of the GNN receptive field. Existing methods either completely abandon topological information or rely on computationally expensive sparsification.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Parameter Decoupled GNNs (PDGNNs) with Topology-aware Embedding Memory (TEM) to reduce the space complexity to O(n) while fully preserving topological information. 

Specifically, PDGNNs decouple the trainable parameters from individual nodes/edges by first embedding computation ego-subgraphs into compact Topology-aware Embeddings (TEs) without trainable parameters. TEs then participate in computation with trainable parameters. Since TEs have fixed sizes, storing them reduces space complexity. TEM replays TEs to alleviate forgetting.  

Based on the topology-preserving nature of TEs, the paper reveals a unique pseudo-training effect, where replaying one TE trains the model on all nodes in its ego-subgraph. This motivates a novel coverage maximization sampling strategy to select TEs with larger ego-subgraphs.

Main Contributions:
1) Propose PDGNNs-TEM to reduce memory space complexity from O(nd^L) to O(n) while fully preserving topological information
2) Discover the pseudo-training effect unique to continual learning on graphs  
3) Develop coverage maximization sampling to enhance performance given tight memory budgets
4) Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments under both class-incremental and task-incremental scenarios

The proposed PDGNNs-TEM provides an effective and efficient framework for continual learning on expanding graphs, with strong experimental results and instructive theoretical findings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Parameter Decoupled Graph Neural Networks with Topology-aware Embedding Memory that effectively performs continual learning on expanding graphs by decoupling model parameters from computation subgraphs to derive compact topology-aware embeddings for memory replay.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a general framework of Parameter Decoupled Graph Neural Networks (PDGNNs) with Topology-aware Embedding Memory (TEM) for continual learning on expanding graphs. This framework decouples the trainable parameters from the computation graph to derive compact Topology-aware Embeddings (TEs) that preserve the topological information for memory replay.

2. It reduces the memory space complexity from O(nd^L) to O(n) with the proposed TEs, which makes memory replay feasible for continual learning on graphs.

3. It discovers and theoretically analyzes the "pseudo-training effect" of replaying TEs, which shows that replaying one TE could alleviate forgetting on neighboring nodes in the computation subgraph. This motivates the proposed coverage maximization sampling strategy.  

4. Through extensive experiments on public benchmarks with up to millions of nodes, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed PDGNNs-TEM framework. It shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both class-incremental and task-incremental continual learning scenarios.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a memory efficient and effective continual learning framework for expanding graphs to address the memory explosion challenge. Both theoretically and empirically, it demonstrates the benefits of preserving topological information with TEs for continual learning on graphs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Parameter Decoupled Graph Neural Networks (PDGNNs): The proposed framework that decouples the trainable parameters from the individual nodes/edges in graph neural networks to derive topology-aware embeddings (TEs).

- Topology-Aware Embeddings (TEs): Compact vector representations that encode the topological information of computation ego-subgraphs. Enables efficient memory replay. 

- Topology-Aware Embedding Memory (TEM): Memory buffer that stores TEs instead of full computation ego-subgraphs to achieve reduced space complexity.

- Pseudo-training effect: Theoretical finding that training on the TE of one node also influences the predictions of other nodes in the computation ego-subgraph. Motivates coverage maximization sampling.  

- Coverage maximization sampling: Proposed sampling strategy to select TEs covering larger computation ego-subgraphs to maximize pseudo-training effects.

- Continual learning on expanding graphs: Learning representations on graphs that expand over time with new types of nodes/edges. Requires addressing catastrophic forgetting.

- Class-incremental and task-incremental scenarios: Two evaluation settings in continual learning - either predicting from all seen classes or only within each task.
