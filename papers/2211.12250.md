# [Efficient Frequency Domain-based Transformers for High-Quality Image   Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12250)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How to develop an efficient and effective deep learning method for high-quality image deblurring by exploring the properties of Transformers in the frequency domain?

Specifically, the key questions/hypotheses appear to be:

- Can we estimate the scaled dot-product attention in Transformers more efficiently by using operations in the frequency domain instead of matrix multiplications in the spatial domain? 

- Can we improve the quality of restored images by developing a discriminative frequency domain feed-forward network (DFFN) that selectively preserves useful frequency information?

- Will an asymmetrical encoder-decoder network architecture that uses the proposed frequency domain Transformer modules only in the decoder further improve performance for image deblurring?

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by carefully designing Transformer components to operate in the frequency domain and incorporating these into an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, they can develop a more efficient and higher quality image deblurring method compared to prior Transformer and CNN-based approaches. The paper presents innovations in frequency domain Transformer attention, discriminative frequency selection, and asymmetric architecture design to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel frequency domain-based self-attention solver (FSAS) is proposed to estimate the scaled dot-product attention more efficiently in the frequency domain instead of using matrix multiplications in the spatial domain. This reduces the space and time complexity from quadratic to linear.

2. A discriminative frequency domain-based feed-forward network (DFFN) is developed to determine which low and high frequency information to preserve for latent clear image restoration. This is motivated by JPEG compression. 

3. An asymmetric encoder-decoder network architecture is used where FSAS is only applied in the decoder to avoid using it on blurry shallow features from the encoder.

4. The proposed FSAS and DFFN components are combined into an end-to-end trainable network for image deblurring. Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is developing and integrating novel Transformer components that operate in the frequency domain to achieve an efficient and effective image deblurring method. The core ideas are using frequency domain transformations like FFT to avoid costly matrix multiplications and being selective about frequency content.
