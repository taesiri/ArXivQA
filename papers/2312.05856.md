# [A Video is Worth 256 Bases: Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization   Inversion for Zero-Shot Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05856)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing diffusion-based zero-shot video editing methods typically use the DDIM inversion technique to map input videos into the latent space before editing. However, DDIM inversion struggles to achieve accurate reconstruction and temporal consistency when applied on a per-frame basis. This limits the editing capabilities of current video editing pipelines. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion technique. Unlike DDIM inversion, STEM formulates dense video features under an expectation-maximization framework to iteratively estimate a compact set of bases (e.g. 256 bases) that represent the entire video. Each frame then uses this global representation for inversion instead of its own per-frame features.  

Key benefits:
- Achieves superior reconstruction quality and temporal consistency compared to per-frame DDIM inversion
- Seamlessly integrates into existing pipelines by just replacing DDIM inversion, without any finetuning
- Reduces computational complexity of self-attention layers due to low-rank representation

The authors qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate consistent improvements by simply replacing DDIM inversion with STEM inversion in two state-of-the-art zero-shot video editing techniques - TokenFlow and FateZero. User studies also confirm superior editing fidelity and consistency using STEM inversion.

Key contributions:
- Novel video inversion technique (STEM) that models videos under a global low-rank expectation-maximization framework 
- Demonstrates performance gains by just replacing DDIM inversion in existing pipelines, without any finetuning
- Extensive experiments proving consistent quantitative and qualitative improvements over DDIM inversion baselines


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion method that reformulates dense video features into a compact low-rank representation to achieve improved reconstruction quality, editing ability, and efficiency for diffusion-based zero-shot video editing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It proposes a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion method for diffusion-based video editing. This reformulates a dense video under an expectation-maximization iteration manner to evaluate a more compact basis set representation. 

2) The STEM inversion reduces complexity and improves reconstruction quality compared to standard DDIM inversion for videos, even though it explores the global spatial-temporal context.

3) Extensive experiments show that simply replacing DDIM inversion with the proposed STEM inversion in existing video editing pipelines can painlessly improve video editing performance.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel STEM inversion method that provides better video reconstruction and editing by estimating a compact low-rank representation of the input video using an EM algorithm. This also reduces complexity compared to prior video inversion techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion - The proposed video inversion method that uses an expectation-maximization approach to find a compact, low-rank representation of the input video. 

- Basis set - The low-rank representation (e.g. 256 bases) estimated by the STEM inversion to capture the spatial-temporal information of the whole video.

- Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm - Used to iteratively alternate between computing responsibilities (E-step) and updating bases (M-step) to converge to a compact video representation. 

- Zero-shot video editing - Editing videos without any finetuning, by inverting to latent space, editing with text prompts, and reconstructing. Works such as FateZero and TokenFlow are examples.

- Diffusion models - Generative models, like DDIM, that can invert images/videos to latent space for editing and can reconstruct via iterative denoising.

- Computational complexity - STEM inversion can achieve lower complexity than naïve spatial-temporal inversion by using a compact set of bases.

- Temporal consistency - Maintaining coherent motions and appearances across video frames, a key challenge in video editing addressed by the proposed STEM inversion.
