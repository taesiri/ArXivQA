# [Visual Prompt Multi-Modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10826)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we effectively adapt pre-trained RGB-based visual trackers to downstream multi-modal tracking tasks using prompt learning? 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes a visual prompt tracking framework called ViPT to adapt RGB trackers to multi-modal tracking in an efficient way using prompt learning. This avoids expensive full fine-tuning of large models on limited downstream data.

- Designs a novel Modality-Complementary Prompter (MCP) module that can learn effective prompts from the RGB and auxiliary modalities to inject into the frozen RGB tracker.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple multi-modal tracking benchmarks including RGB-D, RGB-T and RGB-E, while only tuning less than 1% of parameters.

- Shows the potential of prompt learning for multi-modal tracking as an alternative to full fine-tuning. Enables efficient knowledge transfer from large-scale pre-trained RGB models to downstream tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that prompt learning can effectively adapt RGB trackers to multi-modal tracking in a parameter-efficient way, avoiding expensive full fine-tuning. The ViPT framework and MCP module are proposed to realize this idea and achieve superior performance on multiple tasks.
