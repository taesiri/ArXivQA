# [LegalBench: A Collaboratively Built Benchmark for Measuring Legal   Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11462)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

What types of legal reasoning can large language models (LLMs) perform?

The authors present LegalBench, a benchmark dataset of legal reasoning tasks, in order to enable the study of LLMs' capabilities on different types of legal reasoning. The paper evaluates various LLMs on the LegalBench benchmark and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses across the different legal reasoning skills tested.

So in summary, the main research question is examining what kinds of legal reasoning abilities current LLMs possess by testing them on a diverse benchmark of legal reasoning tasks crafted by legal experts. The LegalBench dataset and experiments are aimed at systematically evaluating and advancing LLMs' legal reasoning capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation of LegalBench, a collaboratively built benchmark for measuring legal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key points are:

- LegalBench consists of 116 tasks covering 6 different types of legal reasoning (e.g. case analogy, statutory interpretation, synthesis). The tasks were designed by legal experts to capture practically useful skills or interesting capabilities.

- The paper maps the tasks to common legal reasoning frameworks to enable cross-disciplinary conversations about LLMs in law. This provides a shared vocabulary between lawyers and LLM developers. 

- The paper presents an empirical evaluation of 20 LLMs on LegalBench, analyzing their performance on different legal reasoning skills. 

- LegalBench enables new research exploring what types of legal reasoning LLMs can versus cannot perform, and studying how to improve their capabilities.

So in summary, the main contribution is creating this new benchmark LegalBench to systematically measure and advance LLMs' legal reasoning abilities through cross-disciplinary collaboration.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces LegalBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the legal reasoning capabilities of large language models. The benchmark was collaboratively built by legal experts and consists of 154 hand-crafted tasks covering six types of legal reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on LegalBench compares to other research on evaluating legal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs):

- It introduces a new benchmark dataset called LegalBench with over 800 hand-crafted tasks covering different types of legal reasoning. Many prior benchmarks in this area have been smaller in scale or focused on a narrower set of skills. The diversity and size of LegalBench enables more comprehensive evaluation.

- The benchmark tasks were designed through an interdisciplinary process involving legal experts, unlike some other benchmarks that were generated more programmatically. This grounds the benchmark in practically useful legal skills. 

- The paper maps benchmark tasks to conceptual frameworks of legal reasoning from the legal field. This helps connect AI research to existing concepts in law and provides a shared vocabulary for discussing capabilities.

- The paper benchmarks a wide range of commercial and open source LLMs on LegalBench. Some other papers have evaluated fewer or only proprietary models. Comparing many models gives a better sense of current capabilities.

- The paper illustrates different kinds of research questions and explorations enabled by the benchmark, highlighting its utility as a research tool. Other papers introducing benchmarks don't always provide this.

Overall, the scope and interdisciplinary nature of this paper and the LegalBench benchmark seem to advance research in evaluating legal reasoning abilities of LLMs relative to prior work. The analysis seems quite thorough and focused on practical utility.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Evaluating LLMs on additional types of legal reasoning not covered in LegalBench, such as statutory interpretation and application of procedural rules. The authors note LegalBench focuses on substantive legal reasoning.

- Expanding the scope and diversity of tasks in LegalBench. The authors acknowledge limitations in coverage of different legal domains and task formats.

- Studying whether performance on LegalBench tasks correlates with performance on real-world legal tasks. The benchmark tasks are synthetic, so evaluating how well they proxy real legal skills is an open question.

- Better understanding the capabilities and limitations of different training methodologies and model architectures in legal reasoning through experiments on LegalBench.

- Using LegalBench to study societal impacts of LLMs in law and benchmark model biases. The authors suggest it could be a tool for auditing biases.

- Developing better human evaluation standards and protocols for legal reasoning benchmarks. The authors note challenges in evaluating model performance against "correct" answers.

- Exploring interactive evaluation formats where models generates arguments and counterarguments with humans.

So in summary, the authors recommend expanding LegalBench's coverage, connecting it to real-world legal tasks, using it to study training methods and model biases, and developing better human evaluation protocols. Evaluating additional types of legal reasoning and model capabilities is a core theme.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents LegalBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the legal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). LegalBench was created through an interdisciplinary collaboration between law professors, legal practitioners, and AI researchers. It consists of a diverse set of legal reasoning tasks crafted by legal experts to measure skills that are practically useful for legal work. 

The benchmark includes 120 tasks covering six different types of legal reasoning: case holding, case analogy, statute interpretation, synthesis, application, and issue spotting. An empirical evaluation was conducted on 20 LLMs, including open-source models like Jurassic-1 and commercial models like Anthropic's Claude and AI21's Jurassic-2. The results illustrate current strengths and weaknesses of LLMs on different legal reasoning skills. The authors argue LegalBench enables cross-disciplinary conversations and research on AI in law by mapping tasks to conceptual frameworks from legal scholarship. Overall, the benchmark and analyses aim to shed light on what types of legal reasoning current LLMs can and cannot perform.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents LegalBench, a collaboratively built benchmark for measuring legal reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). The benchmark was constructed through an interdisciplinary process involving legal professionals who designed and crafted tasks covering six types of legal reasoning that are practically useful or interesting to lawyers. 20 open-source and commercial LLMs were evaluated on LegalBench. The benchmark enables studying what types of legal reasoning LLMs can perform, illustrates how legal reasoning frameworks correspond to the benchmark tasks to facilitate cross-disciplinary conversations, and supports research on developing LLMs for legal applications.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting LegalBench, a new benchmark for measuring legal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key problem it aims to address is the lack of a systematic way to evaluate how well LLMs can perform different types of legal reasoning. 

The authors argue that existing benchmarks either focus too narrowly on certain skills like textual entailment, or are not crafted specifically to test legal reasoning. So there is a need for a new benchmark that covers diverse forms of legal reasoning, with tasks designed by legal experts to reflect practically useful skills. 

LegalBench aims to fill this gap by providing a suite of legal reasoning tasks covering skills like case analogy, applying rules to facts, and statutory interpretation. By benchmarking various LLMs, it enables studying their capabilities and limitations on these skills. Overall, the benchmark facilitates research on how LLMs may (or may not) replicate human legal reasoning.
