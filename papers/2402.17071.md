# [Path Planning for a Cooperative Navigation Aid Vehicle to Assist   Multiple Agents Intermittently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17071)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers the problem of designing a path plan for a single cooperative navigation aid (CNA) vehicle to intermittently provide aiding to multiple agents in order to minimize the average navigation uncertainty across all agents. 
- The CNA and agents are modeled as constant velocity vehicles moving in a 2D plane. The agents move along known nominal trajectories with uncertain initial positions.
- The goal is to optimize the sequence of agents that the CNA aids, as well as when the CNA should surface to improve its own position estimate. This is subject to a total time budget.

Solution:
- Navigation aiding is modeled using a Kalman filter framework. When an agent is aided, its position uncertainty is reduced. 
- The paper first analyzes the single aiding case and derives an expression for the optimal time-to-aid for a single agent intercept.
- A greedy algorithm is then proposed that allocates agents to the CNA using a reward function based on: (1) potential cost reduction, (2) closeness to optimal aid time, (3) transit time.
- The algorithm builds a sequence of agent aid tasks, and considers when to add a surfacing task for the CNA.

Contributions:
- Formulates the intermittent cooperative aiding problem with surfacing actions and mission time limit
- Derives optimal time-to-aid for single agent case
- Develops greedy algorithm with intuitive reward function to efficiently solve problem
- Compares performance against optimal exhaustive search in simulations

In summary, the paper provides a formulation and efficient solution for intermittent cooperative navigation aiding by optimally sequencing tasks and planning surfacing actions for the CNA vehicle. A key contribution is the development of the greedy algorithm using the proposed heterogeneous reward function.
