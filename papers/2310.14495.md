# [InstructExcel: A Benchmark for Natural Language Instruction in Excel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14495)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper seeks to address is:

Can we leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate executable Excel OfficeScripts code from natural language instructions?

In particular, the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset called "InstructExcel" to investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs can take a natural language description of a desired action or manipulation in Excel, and generate the corresponding OfficeScripts code to execute that action. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that with the evolution of large pretrained language models like GPT-3/4, T5, etc., these models may now be capable of generating valid and executable OfficeScripts code from NL instructions, even in a zero-shot or few-shot setting. However, this capability has not been extensively benchmarked.

So in summary, the central research question is whether the instruction learning paradigm can be effectively applied to generate executable Excel code from NL, and the paper introduces a new benchmark to investigate this question across various LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing a new benchmark called InstructExcel for evaluating natural language to code generation models in the domain of Excel. 

2. Constructing a dataset of over 10,000 examples mapping natural language instructions to Excel OfficeScripts code, collected by having crowdworkers record their actions in Excel and describe them in natural language.

3. Evaluating several state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and T5 on this new benchmark in various settings like zero-shot, few-shot, and finetuning. The results show that InstructExcel remains challenging even for the latest models.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that techniques like using larger models, providing more in-context examples, and dynamic prompting can help improve performance on this benchmark.

5. Presenting a case study on extracting conditional formatting tasks from InstructExcel, showing its potential for deriving specific benchmarks for Excel sub-tasks. 

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of a new challenging benchmark for evaluating natural language to code generation in the domain of Excel, along with experiments highlighting current model capabilities and limitations. The authors frame this as an important step towards building user-friendly AI assistants that can help novice Excel users accomplish tasks more easily.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset, InstructExcel, for studying natural language to code generation in the domain of Excel. This adds to existing benchmarks like CoNaLa, DJANGO, and HumanEval that have focused more on general programming languages. The InstructExcel benchmark provides data specifically for generating Excel OfficeScripts from natural language.

- The paper evaluates several state-of-the-art large language models on the benchmark, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and T5. Other recent papers have also benchmarked models like Codex, PaLM, and AlphaCode on programming language datasets. However, this is one of the first to specifically assess these models' capabilities on the Excel domain through the InstructExcel benchmark.

- The paper examines different prompting strategies like zero-shot, few-shot, max-shot, detailed instructions, API documentation, and dynamic prompting. Other related work has also looked at how different prompting approaches can improve code generation. This provides additional evidence on effective prompting methods, tailored to the Excel domain.

- The paper includes both automated metrics and manual evaluation of model outputs. Other papers have noted that automated metrics alone may not fully capture program correctness. The manual analysis provides a more nuanced assessment of where models still struggle on this benchmark.

- The case study on extracting conditional formatting tasks highlights the potential to use InstructExcel as a source dataset for more narrowly focused Excel code generation problems. This connects to work on domain-specific benchmarks for table-to-text, syntax translation, etc.

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution through the benchmark dataset itself as well as the set of experiments analyzing model performance with different prompting techniques. It extends prior program synthesis work into the specialized domain of Excel.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving performance on the InstructExcel benchmark through techniques like better prompting strategies, more advanced model architectures, etc. The paper shows the benchmark is still challenging even for state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 and T5.

- Expanding the coverage of Excel operations and workflows in the InstructExcel dataset. The current benchmark focuses on a subset of Excel functionality, so expanding it could enable training models that generalize even better.

- Exploring methods to better handle spreadsheet data context when generating scripts. The paper mentions that sometimes the instructions require information only present in the actual sheet data. Integrating and reasoning over this data could improve results.

- Studying the compositional generalization abilities of models trained on InstructExcel. The benchmark contains individual Excel operations that could be combined, allowing tests of compositional generalization.

- Using InstructExcel as a source dataset to extract more focused benchmarks on Excel subtasks like plotting, formatting, formula creation etc. The case study on conditional formatting rules demonstrates this possibility.

- Developing techniques to improve semantic equivalence evaluation between the generated scripts and ground truth, beyond just textual similarity metrics. This could involve actually executing the scripts and comparing spreadsheet outputs.

- Testing the generalizability of models trained on InstructExcel to other spreadsheet applications besides Excel, to study how well the scripts generation capability transfers.
