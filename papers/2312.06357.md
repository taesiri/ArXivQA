# [FOSS: A Self-Learned Doctor for Query Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06357)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces FOSS, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based query optimization framework. Unlike prior approaches that either learn to construct execution plans from scratch or only coarse-grained steering of the traditional optimizer through hints, FOSS takes a "whitebox-expertise" approach by incrementally refining and modifying suboptimal plans generated by the traditional optimizer in a step-by-step manner. Specifically, FOSS consists of a planner module that models plan refinement as a Markov decision process solved via DRL, as well as an asymmetric advantage model that serves to select the optimal plan among candidates. To accelerate training, FOSS further incorporates a simulated environment utilizing the advantage model and traditional optimizer for efficient self-bootstrapping with ample simulated experiences. Evaluations on Join Order Benchmark, TPC-DS, and Stack Overflow datasets demonstrate FOSS’s superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, reducing total query latency by 15-83% against PostgreSQL while achieving better generalization. The key innovation is the whitebox fine-grained plan optimization approach starting from traditional optimizer’s original plans. By balancing practicality and high optimization potential, FOSS opens up a promising new direction for learned query optimization.
