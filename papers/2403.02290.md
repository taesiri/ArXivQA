# [Koopman-Assisted Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms based on Bellman equations become intractable for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. This limits their applicability to complex real-world problems. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called Koopman-Assisted Reinforcement Learning (KARL) that leverages the Koopman operator to lift nonlinear dynamics into a higher-dimensional space where they behave linearly. This facilitates the application of RL algorithms. Specifically, two max-entropy RL algorithms are reformulated using the Koopman operator:

1. Soft Koopman Value Iteration (SKVI)
2. Soft Actor Koopman-Critic (SAKC) 

The key idea is to view the value function as a Koopman observable and advance it in time using the Koopman operator in the lifted space. A Koopman tensor is introduced to capture state-action interactions and construct control-dependent Koopman operators.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of SKVI and SAKC algorithms under the KARL framework that overcome limitations of traditional RL

- Validation on 4 environments - linear system, Lorenz system, fluid flow past cylinder, and stochastic double well potential.

- State-of-the-art performance compared to RL baselines like SAC and control baselines like LQR

- Koopman tensor formulation to handle control dependence and extend Koopman control theory to Markov decision processes

- Extensive ablation studies analyzing influence of design choices like dictionary space and compute budget

- KARL enables interpretability to understand and simplify learned policies

The results demonstrate KARL matches or exceeds performance of neural network SAC and outperforms LQR in nonlinear systems. Future work is discussed to address limitations around dictionary specification, online learning, continuous time systems etc.
