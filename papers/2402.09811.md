## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text detection is an important first step for optical character recognition (OCR). Deep learning models require large labeled datasets which are not available for many languages and writing styles. 
- There is a lack of labeled word-level text detection datasets for Indian scripts and multilingual documents containing both printed and handwritten texts.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Textron, a weakly supervised framework to improve text detection without relying on labeled data.  
- It combines deep learning and computer vision-based text detection methods into "labeling functions" that produce noisy labels. 
- A probabilistic graphical model is trained to aggregate the outputs of the labeling functions and learn the parameters associated with each one.
- The labeling functions include both pre-trained deep learning models like DBNet as well as traditional computer vision techniques like contour detection and Canny edge detection.

Key Contributions:
- Textron eliminates the dependency on labeled data for training text detection models. It can work effectively even with unlabeled documents in low-resource languages.
- It captures the strengths of both deep learning and computer vision methods - robustness of DL models and ability of CV models to capture diverse writing styles. 
- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art or improved performance across English, machine printed Indian scripts, and handwritten Devanagari documents. 
- For handwritten Devanagari text, Textron shows significant gains, with recall improved from 62.33% to 74.51% over the DBNet baseline.
- The approach is general and flexible to incorporate customized labeling functions for enhanced multilingual and multi-modal text detection.

In summary, Textron provides an effective weakly supervised framework to combine different text detection approaches using unlabeled data. It demonstrates improved multilingual and multi-modal text detection, especially for low-resource languages and handwritten documents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Textron, a weak supervision-based framework for multilingual text detection that combines deep learning and computer vision techniques through an ensemble of labeling functions, demonstrating improved performance especially for low-resource languages and handwritten text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a weak supervision-based approach called Textron for multilingual text detection. Specifically:

- Textron combines deep learning-based and computer vision-based text detection methods into a unified framework using the data programming paradigm. It allows incorporating different labeling functions without labeled data.

- Textron is shown to work well for detecting text in low-resource languages and scripts, including Indian languages, where labeled data is scarce. It improves over existing deep learning methods like DBNet in these settings.

- For handwritten Devanagari text detection, Textron substantially outperforms baselines with over 9% absolute gain in F1 score. It maintains higher performance over baselines across different IOU thresholds.

- The paper demonstrates Textron's flexibility - it can incorporate custom labeling functions to capture nuances of different writing styles, scripts, fonts etc. This makes it adaptable to diverse text detection tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Textron, a weakly supervised approach for multilingual text detection that works well in low-resource settings and can capture diversity of text by incorporating multiple weak detection methods.

The paper proposes a weakly supervised framework called Textron for multilingual text detection, which combines deep learning models and computer vision techniques into an ensemble, using the data programming paradigm. The key focus is on improving text detection for Indian languages and handwritten text, in low resource scenarios with limited or no labeled data. The framework uses multiple labeling functions based on CV and DL methods to produce noisy labels, which get aggregated through a generative model to produce consensus predictions. Both pixel-level and bounding box outputs are generated. Comparisons are provided to deep learning baselines on multi-language datasets. So the main keywords relate to these key ideas and components of the proposed approach.
