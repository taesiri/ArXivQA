# [Parallel WaveGAN: A fast waveform generation model based on generative   adversarial networks with multi-resolution spectrogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11480)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a fast, high-quality neural vocoder for text-to-speech synthesis using generative adversarial networks, without needing to use a separate autoregressive teacher model or density distillation. 

The key hypothesis is that by jointly training a non-autoregressive WaveNet generator model using a combination of multi-resolution spectrogram loss and adversarial loss, it can learn to generate realistic and natural sounding speech efficiently.

In particular, the paper proposes and evaluates a new model called Parallel WaveGAN that is trained end-to-end with this joint loss approach, without needing a separate pre-trained autoregressive teacher model or density distillation as required by prior parallel waveform generation methods.
