# An Android Robot Head as Embodied Conversational Agent

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can current machine learning techniques combined with simple rule-based animation routines make an android robot head an embodied conversational agent with ChatGPT as its core component?The authors aim to show how combining scripted animations and state-of-the-art machine learning models can result in an android robot head that can have natural conversations. The core capabilities they want to demonstrate are speech recognition, dialogue generation, speech synthesis, and lip syncing animations. The overarching goal appears to be developing an autonomous embodied conversational agent using an iterative implementation approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It presents the implementation of an android robot head as an embodied conversational agent using a combination of scripted animations and state-of-the-art machine learning models. - It provides details on the android robot head hardware, the machine learning models used for speech recognition, text-to-speech, dialogue, and lip syncing, as well as the software architecture.- It describes an iterative development approach that enabled building a prototype conversational agent system with the android head in an agile way.- It evaluates the current implementation by conducting user interviews, identifying positive aspects as well as areas for improvement. - Based on the evaluation, next steps are outlined to further develop the system, including improving animations, enabling multilingual conversations, running models on edge devices, and enhancing lip sync capabilities.In summary, the main contribution is presenting an iterative implementation of an android robot head as an embodied conversational agent using a combination of scripted animations and machine learning models, along with an evaluation to guide further development.
