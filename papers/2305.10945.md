# An Android Robot Head as Embodied Conversational Agent

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can current machine learning techniques combined with simple rule-based animation routines make an android robot head an embodied conversational agent with ChatGPT as its core component?The authors aim to show how combining scripted animations and state-of-the-art machine learning models can result in an android robot head that can have natural conversations. The core capabilities they want to demonstrate are speech recognition, dialogue generation, speech synthesis, and lip syncing animations. The overarching goal appears to be developing an autonomous embodied conversational agent using an iterative implementation approach.
