# [GNSS Positioning using Cost Function Regulated Multilateration and Graph   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
GNSS positioning in urban environments is challenging due to frequent blockage of satellite signals by tall buildings, causing large errors in the measurement of satellite ranges (pseudo-ranges). Existing methods heuristically estimate these measurement errors and use them suboptimally in the multilateration optimization process, leading to inaccurate location predictions. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a 3-component solution:

1. Cost Function Regulator: 
- Derives constraints on pseudo-range measurements and weights so that the optimization cost function is guaranteed to converge to ground truth location given perfect measurement error estimates.
- Provides analytical proof that optimal weights are not unique.

2. Graph Neural Network-based Error Estimator:
- Models relations between GNSS measurements in an epoch using a graph representation.
- Learns to estimate pseudo-range errors in a supervised way. 

3. Measurement Selector:
- Removes noisy measurements based on error distribution when redundancy exists.
- Adapts filtering based on number of available measurements.

The estimated errors are used by the Cost Function Regulator to adjust measurements and weights so that the optimization leads to true location.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes and proves constraints for optimal localization given measurement errors.
- Proposes using GNNs to jointly process all signals in an epoch for improved error estimation. 
- Introduces measurement selection approach that discards redundant noisy signals.
- Demonstrates significant gains over classical and learning-based methods.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end deep learning solution for GNSS localization that outperforms previous approaches by reliably estimating measurement errors and properly integrating them in the optimization process.
