# [STR-Cert: Robustness Certification for Deep Text Recognition on Deep   Learning Pipelines and Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Robustness certification aims to formally verify that neural network predictions remain unchanged under small perturbations to the input. Despite progress, existing certification methods are limited to simple architectures like convolutional and recurrent networks, mostly evaluated on MNIST. This work focuses on certifying robustness for the complex task of scene text recognition (STR) across standard STR pipelines and Vision Transformers.

Methods: 
The authors propose STR-Cert, the first certification methodology for STR models, by extending the DeepPoly abstract interpretation framework. They derive novel polyhedral bounds and algorithms to certify key components of STR architectures:

- Spatial transformer network (bilinear sampling map)
- Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) decoder 
- Attention decoder (LSTM, attention weights)
- Vision Transformer (patch embedding, positional encoding)

Main Contributions:

- First methodology to certify robustness of complex STR pipelines and Vision Transformers, using novel bounds and certification algorithms
- Evaluate STR-Cert on 3 model architectures - standard STR pipelines, attention decoder STR, Vision Transformer STR
- Conduct extensive experiments on 6 STR datasets, comparing robustness across architectures 
- Demonstrate STR-Cert scales better for Vision Transformers compared to LSTM-based pipelines
- Provide insights on tradeoffs between accuracy, confidence and robustness under adversarial training

The work significantly advances neural network certification by tackling a complex real-world task and architecture. It opens up many future directions like certifying larger pre-trained models, incorporating GPU parallelism and branch-and-bound techniques, and handling other perturbations like rotation.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes STR-Cert, the first certification method for scene text recognition models and Vision Transformers, which significantly extends the DeepPoly verification framework by deriving novel polyhedral bounds and algorithms to certify key components of standard scene text recognition pipelines and Vision Transformer architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing STR-Cert, an efficient and scalable robustness certification method for text recognition models and the Vision Transformer. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first certification method for these types of models.

2. Deriving novel polyhedral bounds and algorithms to certify key components of the STR models such as the CTC decoder, Softmax function, patch embedding, and spatial transformer network. 

3. Significantly extending the DeepPoly polyhedral verification framework to implement STR-Cert, which can certify three types of STR architectures including the Vision Transformer.

4. Conducting extensive experiments to certify and compare the robustness of STR models on six datasets. This demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of the proposed certification methodology, particularly for the Vision Transformer. It also provides insights and comparisons between different STR architectures in terms of their robustness.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first certification method for complex scene text recognition pipelines and Vision Transformers, through novel bounds and algorithms, as well as providing a thorough experimental analysis and comparison of different model architectures.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and contents, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper:

- Robustness certification: Formally verifying and proving the robustness of neural networks against adversarial inputs.

- Scene text recognition (STR): The task of recognizing text from natural scene images.

- Standard STR pipelines: The commonly used 4-stage architecture for scene text recognition, consisting of transformation, feature extraction, sequence modeling, and prediction. 

- Vision Transformer (ViT): A Transformer model adapted for computer vision tasks.

- ViTSTR: A Vision Transformer model adapted specifically for the scene text recognition task.  

- DeepPoly: A polyhedral verification framework for certifying neural networks based on propagating abstract polyhedral bounds through the network.

- CTC decoder: Connectionist Temporal Classification decoder that allows predicting sequence outputs for sequence tasks. 

- Attention decoder: Decoder that uses an attention mechanism to decode sequence outputs.

- Adversarial robustness: Robustness of models against adversarial attacks and inputs.

- Perturbation budgets: The maximum amount of perturbation allowed in crafting adversarial inputs. 

So in summary, the key themes are around robustness verification/certification methodology (DeepPoly) applied to complex sequence recognition pipelines and models (STR models, Vision Transformer) for proving robustness against adversarial attacks, with concepts like CTC/Attention decoders and perturbation budgets also playing an important role.
