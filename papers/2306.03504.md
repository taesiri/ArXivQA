# [Ada-TTA: Towards Adaptive High-Quality Text-to-Talking Avatar Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03504)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we synthesize high-quality, identity-preserving, and lip-synchronized talking avatar videos given only a few minutes of training data of a target person? The key challenges are:1) How to synthesize speech that preserves the vocal identity/timbre of the target speaker using only a small reference audio sample. 2) How to generate talking facial animations that are realistic, high-fidelity, and properly lip-synced to the synthesized speech, again using only a few minutes of training video.The paper proposes a new method called Ada-TTA that combines:- A zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model to synthesize identity-preserving speech from text.- A talking facial generation method using neural rendering that can produce high-quality and lip-synced animations from limited training data.By combining these state-of-the-art approaches in TTS and talking facial generation into one pipeline, the paper aims to address the key challenges and enable high-quality text-to-talking avatar synthesis from minimal training data of a target person.
