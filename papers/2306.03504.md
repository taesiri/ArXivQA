# [Ada-TTA: Towards Adaptive High-Quality Text-to-Talking Avatar Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03504)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we synthesize high-quality, identity-preserving, and lip-synchronized talking avatar videos given only a few minutes of training data of a target person? The key challenges are:1) How to synthesize speech that preserves the vocal identity/timbre of the target speaker using only a small reference audio sample. 2) How to generate talking facial animations that are realistic, high-fidelity, and properly lip-synced to the synthesized speech, again using only a few minutes of training video.The paper proposes a new method called Ada-TTA that combines:- A zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model to synthesize identity-preserving speech from text.- A talking facial generation method using neural rendering that can produce high-quality and lip-synced animations from limited training data.By combining these state-of-the-art approaches in TTS and talking facial generation into one pipeline, the paper aims to address the key challenges and enable high-quality text-to-talking avatar synthesis from minimal training data of a target person.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Ada-TTA, an adaptive text-to-talking avatar synthesis system that can generate high-quality, identity-preserving talking avatar videos from just a few minutes of training data. Specifically, the key contributions are:- A zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model that can synthesize personalized speech from just a short reference audio clip, by disentangling speech into content, timbre and prosody.- Using a recent neural talking face generation method called GeneFace++ that can generate high-fidelity and lip-synchronized talking face videos from limited data. - Combining the benefits of the above two models into a joint Ada-TTA system that takes just text as input and outputs a high-quality talking avatar video, while preserving the identity and requiring minimal data.- Demonstrating through experiments that Ada-TTA can generate realistic and identity-preserving talking avatar videos that are superior to baseline systems in terms of both objective metrics and subjective human evaluation.In summary, the main contribution is developing a text-to-talking avatar system that can produce high-quality results with minimal data by effectively combining recent advances in multi-speaker TTS and talking face generation. This could enable many potential applications in digital human production.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The TL;DR of this paper is: It proposes a method called Ada-TTA to synthesize realistic talking avatar videos from just text input, using only a few minutes of video of a person talking as training data.
