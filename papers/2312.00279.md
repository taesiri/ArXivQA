# [Age-Based Scheduling for Mobile Edge Computing: A Deep Reinforcement   Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00279)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper studies age-based scheduling to optimize information freshness in mobile edge computing systems. It begins by redefining the concept of age of information (AoI) to accommodate event-driven status updates that require data processing before utilization. Based on this, an AoI minimization problem is formulated for the multi-user MEC system under constraints on energy consumption and spectrum bandwidth. The problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and transformed into an average reward reinforcement learning problem using Lagrangian relaxation. 

To accelerate learning, the paper leverages a post-decision state (PDS) technique that exploits partial knowledge of system dynamics. This PDS method is integrated with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to yield a highly efficient deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Several optimizations are made, including redesigning the cost function, normalizing action variables, and recalculating costs during training.

Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance of the proposed deep PDS learning algorithm over benchmarks. It quickly converges to maintain near-optimal AoI while satisfying the energy constraints. The results showcase robustness across diverse scenarios with varying numbers of devices and energy budgets. The algorithm significantly outperforms DDPG variants and scheduling schemes based solely on local processing or computation offloading. This underscores the promise of combining deep reinforcement learning with domain knowledge exploitation for tackling complicated sequential decision making problems.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Many Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications rely on timely status information collected by wireless devices (WDs) and processed at edge servers. However, the traditional definition of Age of Information (AoI) assumes the status updates can be directly used without processing. To better serve IoT applications that require data processing, the paper redefines AoI as the time elapsed since the earliest unprocessed data was generated. Based on this, the paper addresses the problem of minimizing the long-term average AoI of WDs in a mobile edge computing system under constraints on energy consumption and wireless bandwidth.

Proposed Solution:
The paper formulates the AoI minimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and uses Lagrangian relaxation to transform it into an equivalent unconstrained MDP that can be solved by reinforcement learning. To accelerate learning, the paper leverages post-decision states (PDS) to exploit partial knowledge of system dynamics. This PDS learning algorithm is further integrated with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to obtain a deep neural network based solution called Deep PDS Learning (DPDS) that can handle continuous and high-dimensional state/action spaces.

Main Contributions:
- Redefines AoI concept to enable age-optimal scheduling of IoT applications that require data processing  
- Formulates online AoI minimization problem for mobile edge computing systems and converts it to an equivalent CMDP
- Proposes PDS learning to accelerate solving CMDP by exploiting known system dynamics
- Develops DPDS algorithm combining PDS with DDPG that utilizes deep neural networks for function approximation 
- Employs various techniques (e.g. cost function redesign, variable normalization) to enhance efficiency and stability of DPDS
- Simulation results demonstrate superior performance of DPDS against benchmarks in reducing AoI under various settings

In summary, the key novelty of the paper lies in redefining AoI and proposing the DPDS algorithm to enable real-time status updates for data processing intensive IoT applications in resource constrained edge computing environments.
