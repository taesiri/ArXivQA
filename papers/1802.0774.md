# [Singularities in Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs cosmological models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the dynamics of the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs field (EccH) system near the initial singularities in the presence of Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) symmetries. The main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) To determine if the "Small Bang" singularity, in which the Higgs field remains bounded but certain curvature invariants diverge, is a genuine physical spacetime singularity or just a mathematical artifact. 2) To investigate whether the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism for generating particle masses works near the initial singularities, or if there is an early period where particle masses are not well-defined.3) To find numerical solutions that connect the asymptotic power series solutions near the singularities to larger scales, in order to better understand the global dynamics of the EccH system. 4) To numerically explore whether there are additional solutions beyond the power series solutions, such as those with non-analytic behavior near singularities.So in summary, the main goals are to analytically and numerically study the EccH system near cosmological singularities, determine the nature of the "Small Bang", explore how particle masses are generated via the BEH mechanism, and find global solutions that connect the asymptotic regimes.
