# [Singularities in Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs cosmological models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.0774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the dynamics of the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs field (EccH) system near the initial singularities in the presence of Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) symmetries. The main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) To determine if the "Small Bang" singularity, in which the Higgs field remains bounded but certain curvature invariants diverge, is a genuine physical spacetime singularity or just a mathematical artifact. 

2) To investigate whether the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism for generating particle masses works near the initial singularities, or if there is an early period where particle masses are not well-defined.

3) To find numerical solutions that connect the asymptotic power series solutions near the singularities to larger scales, in order to better understand the global dynamics of the EccH system. 

4) To numerically explore whether there are additional solutions beyond the power series solutions, such as those with non-analytic behavior near singularities.

So in summary, the main goals are to analytically and numerically study the EccH system near cosmological singularities, determine the nature of the "Small Bang", explore how particle masses are generated via the BEH mechanism, and find global solutions that connect the asymptotic regimes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Analytically deriving all asymptotic power series solutions near the initial singularities of the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs (EccH) system with FRW symmetries. Three families of solutions are found: solutions with a Big Bang singularity where the Higgs field diverges, solutions with a new "Small Bang" singularity where the Higgs field remains bounded but curvature invariants diverge, and solutions with a Milne-type singularity where both the Higgs field and curvature stay bounded. 

2. Numerically evolving these asymptotic solutions over a large range from the Planck scale to the weak interaction scale. This shows the asymptotic solutions give good approximations even far from the singularities. 

3. Numerically investigating the space of initial data for the EccH system on hypersurfaces of constant Higgs field value. This reveals the three analytic solution families form a set of measure zero, while the complement represents either regular solutions or singular solutions not describable by power series expansions near the singularity.

4. Demonstrating the existence of the new Small Bang solutions where the Higgs field remains bounded. In these solutions, the model does not have instantaneous vacuum states near the singularity, justifying the claim in a previous work that particle rest masses emerge dynamically after the initial singularity.

5. Providing evidence for the existence of singular solutions that cannot be described by power series expansions near the singularity. The asymptotic solutions give only a limited picture of the possible dynamics.

In summary, the main contributions appear to be the analytical derivation of the solution families, the extensive numerical investigations of their properties and generic behaviors, and the introduction and characterization of the new Small Bang solutions. The results offer significant insights into the complex dynamics of gravity coupled to scalar fields.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the dynamics of the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs field system near the initial singularities both analytically and numerically, finding three families of asymptotic power series solutions including a new 'Small Bang' singularity where the Higgs field remains bounded but curvature invariants diverge.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is how I see it comparing to other research in the field:

- The paper is focused specifically on studying singularities in Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs cosmological models with FRW symmetries. This is a quite specialized area of research at the intersection of general relativity, cosmology, and particle physics. Many other papers in these fields cover more general topics.

- The methods used combine analytical calculations of asymptotic solutions near singularities and numerical evolution of the full nonlinear equations. This balances mathematical rigor with exploring the full nonlinear behavior. Other papers tend to focus more on just analytics or just numerics. 

- The main findings are the existence of a new "Small Bang" singularity where curvature diverges but Higgs field stays finite, and evidence that most singularities are not of power-law type. These appear to be new results not reported elsewhere.

- The work builds directly on the authors' prior research deriving the general conformally-coupled Standard Model equations and analyzing vacuum states. Few other papers have studied conformal coupling in as much detail.

- The paper studies a simplified model with just gravity and a Higgs field. Others studying particle physics cosmology often include more fields. However, the simplified model helps isolate key phenomena.

- The results have potentially significant implications for early universe physics and the origins of mass from the Higgs mechanism. More phenomenological papers tend to focus just on late-universe cosmology.

In summary, while the topic is quite specialized, the paper presents rigorous analytical and numerical results elucidating new phenomena and singularities that appear to be unique findings in the field. The connection to particle physics and mass generation also gives the work fairly broad significance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extend the analysis to the full Einstein-Standard Model system with all the fields of the Standard Model rather than just the Higgs field. The authors suggest investigating how gravity and spacetime curvature affect phenomena like symmetry breaking, mass generation, and electric charge emergence for the other fields.

- Explore in more detail the dynamical nature of vacuum states and mass generation in gravitational settings, going beyond the kinematical analysis done in this paper. Investigate how the time evolution transforms non-vacuum states into vacuum states.

- Study how quantum effects like vacuum fluctuations might modify or enrich the picture presented in this classical analysis. Examine how a quantum treatment could affect phenomena like the Small Bang.

- Investigate how anisotropies and inhomogeneities would modify the results obtained under the simplified FRW symmetries. Relax the high degree of symmetry assumed in this analysis.

- Numerically analyze the global structure and dynamics of the full solutions beyond the local power series approximations constructed here. Try to connect early universe dynamics to late universe evolution.

- Search for observational signatures that could test or constrain the theoretical picture presented here. Explore possible connections with cosmic microwave background measurements for example.

- Apply similar conformal coupling of the Higgs field to alternative theories of gravity and see if comparable mass generation phenomena arise.

So in summary, the authors point to several theoretical extensions of their Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs model, as well as possibilities for more detailed numerical simulations and potential observational tests, as interesting directions for future research. Their results seem to open the door to a richer phenomenology of mass generation in the early universe when analyzed from a gravitational perspective.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper studies the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs field (EccH) system with Friedman-Robertson-Walker symmetries, both analytically near the initial singularities and numerically from sub-Planck scales to the era of weak interactions. The main findings are:

- Analytically, the authors find three 1-parameter families of asymptotic power series solutions near the singularities: one with a diverging Higgs field (Big Bang), one with a bounded Higgs field but diverging curvature invariants (Small Bang), and one with bounded Higgs field and curvature (Milne-type singularity). 

- Numerically, the asymptotic solutions provide good approximations even on large scales. The initial data sets form distinct subsets: solutions with Big Bang, Small Bang, or Milne-type singularities, regular solutions, and singular solutions not describable by power series.  

- The existence of the singular solutions shows that symmetry breaking vacuum states of the Higgs sector can emerge dynamically after the initial singularity, giving rise to particle rest masses. The majority of solutions are not reachable by power series methods near the singularity.

In summary, the paper provides both analytical and numerical solutions for the EccH system near cosmological singularities, revealing new spacetime singularities and the key role of Higgs vacuum states in generating particle masses through spontaneous symmetry breaking. Power series techniques have limited domain of applicability for this system.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the dynamics of the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs field (EccH) system near the initial singularities in the presence of Friedman-Robertson-Walker symmetries. The authors solve the field equations analytically up to fourth order near the singularities and determine the solutions numerically as well. They find all the asymptotic, power series singular solutions, which fall into three categories: (1) solutions with a scalar polynomial curvature singularity but bounded Higgs field ("Small Bang"), (2) solutions with a Milne-type singularity with bounded curvature and Higgs field, and (3) solutions with a scalar polynomial curvature singularity and diverging Higgs field ("Big Bang"). Thus, the authors identify a new kind of spacetime singularity in this model ("Small Bang"). They also show that near the singularities, the Higgs sector does not have instantaneous vacuum states or symmetry breaking, so the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism does not operate. Numerically, the solutions are extended from 10^-3 to 10^22 Planck times, overlapping with the era of weak interactions. Some singular solutions are found that cannot be approximated by power series.

In summary, this paper studies Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs field equations analytically near singularities and numerically more globally. It identifies new singular solutions including "Small Bang" with bounded Higgs field. The Higgs vacuum states and symmetry breaking are shown to be absent near singularities. Both power series and non-power series singular solutions are found numerically. The results give insight into gravity's role in particle properties like mass near the Big Bang.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 This paper investigates the dynamics of the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs (EccH) system near the initial singularities in the presence of Friedman-Robertson-Walker symmetries. The main method is to analytically solve the field equations asymptotically up to fourth order near the singularities to find all the asymptotic power series singular solutions. These solutions are then determined numerically as well to see their behavior on larger scales. The three main types of solutions found are:

1) Solutions with a scalar polynomial curvature singularity but bounded Higgs field ("Small Bang") 

2) Solutions with a Milne-type singularity with bounded curvature and Higgs field

3) Solutions with a scalar polynomial curvature singularity and diverging Higgs field ("Big Bang")

The analytical asymptotic and numerical solutions demonstrate the emergence of instantaneous vacuum states and genesis of rest masses after the initial singularity in a dynamical process. The numerical solutions also reveal singular solutions that cannot be approximated by power series near the singularity.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the authors are investigating the dynamics and singularities of the Einstein-conformally coupled Higgs (EccH) system in the presence of Friedman-Robertson-Walker symmetries. In particular, the paper addresses the following key questions:

1) What are the asymptotic power series solutions near the initial singularities of the EccH system with FRW symmetries? The authors determine all such solutions analytically up to fourth order. 

2) What is the nature of the singularities that arise in these asymptotic solutions? The authors find solutions with Big Bang, Small Bang, and Milne-type singularities. The Small Bang is identified as a new type of singularity where the Higgs field remains bounded but curvature invariants diverge.

3) How do these asymptotic solutions connect to the global dynamics and behavior of the EccH system? The authors conduct numerical simulations starting from sub-Planck scales to the weak interaction era to understand the global properties. 

4) How generic are the power-series singular solutions compared to other possible singular behaviours? Numerical results indicate power-series solutions form a zero-measure subset compared to other non-analytic singularities.

5) What do the singular solutions imply about vacuum states and rest mass generation via the BEH mechanism in the early universe? The absence of vacuum states near singularities supports the scenario where rest masses emerge dynamically after the initial singularity.

In summary, the key aim is to understand analytically and numerically the nature of singularities and global dynamics of the EccH system with FRW symmetries, and the implications for early universe phenomenology like mass generation.
