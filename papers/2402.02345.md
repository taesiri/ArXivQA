# [Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Comparing probability distributions defined on a sphere is important for many applications like geology, medical imaging, computer vision, and representation learning. Optimal transport distances like Wasserstein distance are useful for comparing probability measures but have high computational complexity. Sliced variations of optimal transport offer efficient alternatives but extending them to spherical domains is challenging. Prior works require mapping spherical measures to circle domains, needing circular optimal transport solvers that are still slower than solving optimal transport over real line. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein (S3W) distances that leverage the stereographic projection to map spherical measures to measures over the real line, avoiding the need for circular optimal transport. The distortion caused by stereographic projection is addressed by composing it with an injective neural network-based function. S3W and its rotationally invariant extension RI-S3W offer pseudo-metrics and metrics to compare spherical probability measures. An amortized variant ARI-S3W further boosts efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes S3W distances for spherical probability measures using stereographic projection and generalized Radon transform
- Provides S3W, RI-S3W metrics along with theoretical analysis 
- Demonstrates 10-20x speedup over baselines in gradient flows, self-supervised learning, density estimation, and variational inference
- Achieves on-par or superior performance in various experiments involving optimization, sampling, and density estimation

The paper makes sphere-based machine learning more accessible by enhancing computational efficiency of comparing spherical distributions while maintaining accuracy. The proposed S3W framework helps bridge research in spherical geometry and classical sliced Wasserstein literature.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new class of computationally efficient transport distances, called Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein distances, for comparing probability measures defined on a hypersphere, along with theoretical analysis and experimental validation on tasks like gradient flows, representation learning, density estimation, and variational inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Introducing a new class of sliced Wasserstein distances ($S3W$) for comparing spherical probability measures, using the stereographic projection and generalized Radon transform. 

2) Providing a rotationally invariant variation called RI-S3W.

3) Offering theoretical analysis and proofs that $S3W$ is a pseudo-metric while RI-S3W is a true metric.

4) Demonstrating the performance of the proposed metrics in diverse applications like gradient flows, self-supervised learning, spherical density estimation, and generative modeling. The experiments show that the proposed distances are efficient and accurate compared to recent baselines.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the S3W and RI-S3W distances as effective ways to compare probability distributions on a sphere, supported by theory and experiments. The distances are shown to be faster and provide competitive or superior performance compared to existing spherical optimal transport distances.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Spherical probability measures - The paper focuses on developing methods for comparing and working with probability distributions defined on a hypersphere.

- Stereographic projection - A technique to map points on a sphere to a plane, which is leveraged in the proposed method.

- Radon transform - An integral transform that integrates a function over hyperplanes. The paper aims to extend this concept to the sphere. 

- Generalized Radon transform (GRT) - An extension of the Radon transform to integration over more complex hypersurfaces.

- Sliced Wasserstein distances - A computationally efficient variation of optimal transport distances that operates on distributions' lower-dimensional projections.

- Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein (S3W) distance - The new distance metric proposed in the paper for comparing spherical probability measures.

- Rotationally invariant extension (RI-S3W) - A variation of S3W made rotationally invariant using an expectation over rotations.

So in summary, the key focus is on optimal transport and integral geometric concepts tailored to the sphere, with an emphasis on efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the Stereographic Spherical Radon Transform (SSRT) to map spherical probability measures to one-dimensional marginal distributions. How does the SSRT compare to other common spherical Radon transforms like the Funk-Radon transform in terms of mathematical properties and computational efficiency? 

2. The distance distortion caused by the stereographic projection is addressed by composing it with an injective function $h$. What is the rationale behind the specific choice of $h_1$ in Equation 4? How can we optimize $h$ to best preserve geodesic distances on the sphere?

3. Theoretical properties like non-negativity, symmetry, and the triangular inequality are proved for the proposed S3W distance. What additional mathematical properties would be desirable for S3W to have? Can we prove that S3W metrizes weak convergence of measures?

4. For computational efficiency, projections in S3W are taken parallel to coordinate axes in $\mathbb{R}^{d'}$. How does using random projections instead impact mathematical properties, accuracy, and computational complexity? 

5. The rotationally-invariant extension, RI-S3W, averages over rotations sampled from the Haar measure. What is the rationale behind this specific choice? How does using other rotation sampling schemes compare?

6. Can the mathematical proofs for metrics properties be extended to empirical measures? What challenges arise compared to general probability measures?

7. How does the choice of injections function $h$ impact metric distortion for S3W? Can we derive performance bounds quantifying distortion for specific choices of $h$? 

8. For numerical stability near poles, an $\epsilon$-cap is excluded via $\phi_\epsilon$. How does $\epsilon$ impact mathematical properties? Is there an optimal choice for particular applications? 

9. The experiments compare S3W against baselines like SSW. What other recently proposed spherical optimal transport distances would be worthwhile to benchmark against? What are limitations of S3W compared to those methods?

10. What modifications would allow extending S3W to more general manifolds like Lie groups? What new mathematical challenges arise in that setting compared to spheres?
