# [Intelligent Known and Novel Aircraft Recognition -- A Shift from   Classification to Similarity Learning for Combat Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Accurate aircraft recognition and identification, especially of novel/unknown aircraft types, is critical for combat identification (CID) but poses major challenges. 
- Traditional methods like human experts and image classification have limitations in identifying novel aircraft classes.
- There is a lack of robust benchmarks and standardized datasets for evaluating CID models. The existing MTARSI dataset has issues like mislabelling, inconsistent class definitions, cross-contamination, etc.

Proposed Solution - INNAR:
- The paper proposes a novel Intelligent Known and Novel Aircraft Recognition (INNAR) methodology that uses similarity learning and few-shot learning to address the limitations of traditional CID approaches. 
- An embedder model is first trained using triplets and similarity metrics to construct a robust feature representation space. 
- A thresholding technique is then introduced to discern if a test image belongs to known or novel distribution based on its distance within the embedding space.
- Images deemed as known classes are further classified using a few-shot classifier. This allows recognizing both known and novel aircraft types without needing to retrain the embedder.

Key Contributions:
- Introduced a pioneering automated methodology (INNAR) for CID that can identify both known and novel aircraft types.
- Created an improved version of MTARSI dataset (MTARSI-INNAR) by rectifying issues with the original dataset through a rigorous cleaning process involving domain experts.
- Validated that image classification methods make false accuracy claims on noisy MTARSI datasets. Proposed a shift towards similarity and few-shot learning.  
- Showed that larger models like ConvNext give better performance in generating sparse embeddings and handling known vs novel classes.
- The proposed methodology and dataset advances the state-of-the-art in automated combat aircraft identification.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in formulating CID as a few-shot recognition problem and demonstrates a robust pipeline to discern between known and novel aircraft types from remote sensing imagery.
