# [Motion Guided Token Compression for Efficient Masked Video Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18577)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video understanding models like Transformers suffer from high computational complexity ($O(N^2)$) due to attention mechanisms, limiting their ability to handle high frame rates (FPS).
- Increasing FPS captures more motion information but introduces redundancy and exacerbates computational constraints. 

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce Motion Guided Token Compression (MGTC) to eliminate spatial-temporal redundancy while retaining motion patterns.
- MGTC uniformly divides video into patches and computes motion difference between patches in consecutive frames. Patches below a threshold are masked.
- Masking ratio is dynamically set to mask the bottom N\% of patch differences in each video.
- MGTC can be integrated during training or inference to reduce computations.

Contributions:
- Demonstrate FPS increase consistently improves accuracy (1.6-4\%) on Kinetics-400, UCF101 and HMDB51.  
- MGTC outperforms random/cell masking, and with 10-20\% masking surpasses no masking in accuracy.
- Within fixed computational budgets, higher FPS + MGTC substantially outperforms lower FPS without masking.  
- Seamless integration of MGTC during inference or training. Masking ratio of 25\% reduces computations by 31\% while improving accuracy.
- MGTC showed consistent gains with large models over extended 1600 epoch pre-training.
- Analysis shows high redundancy in videos - MGTC key frames and masks redundant patches.

In summary, the paper introduces MGTC that leverages ideas from video compression to reduce spatial-temporal redundancy when increasing FPS. This improves efficiency and motion capturing within constrained budgets. The method is demonstrated extensively on multiple datasets.
