# [Invertible Diffusion Models for Compressed Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Compressed sensing (CS) aims to reconstruct images from fewer linear random measurements, but training existing CS neural networks (NNs) from scratch is time-consuming and leads to suboptimal performance.  
- Recent diffusion model-based methods focus on learning one-step noise estimators, lacking optimization for the full image reconstruction process. They also struggle with slow inference.

Proposed Solution - Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM):

1) End-to-End Training of Diffusion Sampling Process
- Repurposes a pre-trained, large-scale diffusion sampling process as a CS reconstruction model.
- Finetunes all parameters end-to-end to directly predict images from measurements, enhancing adaptability.  
- Uses back-projection to initialize the diffusion process.

2) Two-Level Invertible Design 
- Makes both the multi-step sampling process and the noise estimator invertible using wiring technique.
- Allows clearing most cached features in forward pass and recomputing during backpropagation.
- Significantly reduces GPU memory for end-to-end finetuning.

3) Lightweight Measurement Injectors
- Designed to integrate measurement information into deep features of noise estimator.
- Further improves reconstruction quality with marginal overhead.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes first end-to-end learned diffusion model for image CS, outperforming CS NNs.
- Reduces finetuning effort via weight reuse and two-level invertible design.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98% less sampling steps and >25Ã— faster inference than competitors.
- Validates IDM for natural image CS, inpainting, MRI, and CT reconstruction.

The summary covers the core problem of requiring extensive training for existing CS NNs, the proposed IDM solution and techniques for efficiency/performance enhancement, its main contributions of an accurate and efficient diffusion-based paradigm for CS, and wide applications demonstrating efficacy.
