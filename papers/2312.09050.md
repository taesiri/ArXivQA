# [A Sparse Cross Attention-based Graph Convolution Network with Auxiliary   Information Awareness for Traffic Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09050)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning model called AIMSAN for traffic flow prediction. AIMSAN contains two key components: an Auxiliary Information-aware Module (AIM) and a Sparse cross Attention-based Graph Convolution Network (SAN). The AIM module learns and encodes useful auxiliary information like weather, temporal, and positional data to help the model better understand the traffic data. The SAN module uses a cross-attention mechanism to construct a dynamic adjacency matrix that fuses traffic data and auxiliary information. It then performs sparse graph convolutions on this matrix to efficiently extract spatial-temporal features. AIMSAN handles different node scales well thanks to the sparsity in the SAN module. Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: AIMSAN achieves similar or better accuracy than existing methods but reduces GPU memory usage by 35.74%, training time by 42.25%, and validation time by 45.51% on average. The ablation studies also validate the efficacy of each component of AIMSAN. In summary, AIMSAN advances the state-of-the-art in efficient and accurate traffic prediction leveraging both data and auxiliary information.
