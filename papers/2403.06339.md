# [FOAA: Flattened Outer Arithmetic Attention For Multimodal Tumor   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06339)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of fusing multimodal healthcare data, including imaging and non-imaging data, to provide a more holistic patient representation for improved diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, it notes that while attention mechanisms show promise for multimodal fusion, there is potential to further improve attention scores to better exploit complementary interactions between modalities.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new attention mechanism called Flattened Outer Arithmetic Attention (FOAA) for multimodal fusion. The key ideas are:

1) Use outer arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, product, division) instead of scaled dot product to compute attention scores between flattened feature vectors from each modality. This allows intermingling of all features between modalities.

2) Apply FOAA in both self-attention (within a single modality) and cross-attention (between modalities) modes. 

3) Flattening feature maps from each modality provides a consistent representation suitable for subsequent fusion.

Main Contributions:

1) Introduction of FOAA attention mechanism with outer arithmetic operations for computing attention scores.

2) Demonstration of FOAA in both self-attention and cross-attention scenarios.

3) State-of-the-art multimodal fusion results on two medical datasets: breast tumor classification using MRI and clinical data, and brain tumor grading using histology and gene expression data.

4) Ablation studies validating design decisions and showing FOAA's superiority over other fusion techniques.

In summary, the paper presents FOAA, a novel attention approach to multimodal fusion that achieves new state-of-the-art results by intermingling flattened feature representations between modalities using outer arithmetic operations.
