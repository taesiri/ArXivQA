# [MERIt: Meta-Path Guided Contrastive Learning for Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.0357)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The key research goal of this paper is to develop a self-supervised pre-training method via contrastive learning to enhance the logical reasoning ability of neural models, in order to reduce the reliance on labeled data and improve generalization. The authors propose two main novel components to achieve this:1. A meta-path guided strategy to automatically construct positive and negative training instances from unlabeled text data in a way that reveals logical structure. 2. A counterfactual data augmentation method to eliminate shortcuts induced by pre-trained language models' world knowledge during contrastive pre-training.By combining these two techniques in a self-supervised contrastive learning framework, the paper aims to show that the resulting pre-trained model can achieve superior performance on logical reasoning tasks compared to strong baselines, without requiring additional labeled data. The ablation studies are designed to demonstrate the contribution of each proposed component. Overall, the central hypothesis is that explicitly incorporating logical structure into contrastive pre-training in this way will improve logical reasoning capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new self-supervised pre-training method called MERIT to enhance logical reasoning abilities of language models, using contrastive learning on unlabeled text data. 2. It introduces two key strategies as part of MERIT:- A meta-path based strategy to automatically discover and extract logical structures from raw text to construct positive training instance pairs.- A counterfactual data augmentation method to eliminate shortcuts based on world knowledge in pre-trained models.3. The proposed MERIT method achieves new state-of-the-art results on two logical reasoning benchmark datasets - ReClor and LogiQA, outperforming previous methods relying on task-specific model architectures or augmentation of original training data.4. Ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of the two key strategies - meta-path and counterfactual augmentation - to the overall performance of MERIT.5. The method shows stronger generalization capability on less training data and on other complex reasoning tasks like DREAM.In summary, the key novelty is in developing a self-supervised pre-training approach using contrastive learning to enhance logical reasoning, along with strategies to automatically construct useful training data from raw text and overcome world knowledge shortcuts. The method reduces reliance on annotated data and shows strong empirical performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes MERIt, a meta-path guided contrastive learning method for logical reasoning which employs meta-path for automatic data construction and counterfactual data augmentation to eliminate information shortcuts during pre-training, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ReClor and LogiQA benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a novel self-supervised pre-training method called MERIt for logical reasoning. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:- Task-specific model architectures: Some prior work has focused on developing specialized model architectures like DAGN and Focal Reasoner to incorporate prior knowledge about logical relations. MERIt shows that strong performance can be achieved using a vanilla Transformer model through effective pre-training.- Symbolic reasoning integration: Approaches like LReasoner introduce symbolic logic into neural models using rules and logical expressions. MERIt achieves logical reasoning without relying on complex symbolic parsing, instead discovering logic structure via meta-paths on unlabeled data.- Self-supervised pre-training: MERIt is the first to explore self-supervised pre-training specifically for logical reasoning. It is able to effectively leverage unlabeled data through meta-path guided contrastive learning.- Contrastive learning: Applying contrastive learning to logical reasoning is difficult due to lack of assumptions for grouping text logically. MERIt addresses this via meta-paths and counterfactual data augmentation.- Relation to graph representation learning: MERIt can be viewed as graph contrastive learning on an entity graph, assuming meta-path based consistency requires logical reasoning.In summary, MERIt introduces a novel pre-training approach orthogonal to prior methods, with strong empirical performance. Its ideas of leveraging meta-paths and counterfactual data have not been explored for logical reasoning before. The results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised pre-training in this domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:- Construct more complex training instances by using multiple meta-paths simultaneously or introducing more entity pairs when extracting the meta-path. This can help generate more diverse and challenging negative candidates. - Introduce graph neural networks (GNNs) into the model architecture. Since the proposed method can be viewed as a special case of graph contrastive learning, incorporating GNNs could lead to further improvements. The main challenge is aligning the graph structure granularity between pre-training (on entity level) and fine-tuning (on phrase level).- Explore different strategies for negative candidate construction during contrastive learning. The current approach relies on entity replacement, but other relation editing methods could be investigated.- Evaluate the approach on more diverse logical reasoning tasks and datasets beyond MCQA. This could better demonstrate the generalization ability.- Conduct experiments with more recent pretrained language models like T5, BART or T-NLG to validate the adaptability of the overall framework.- Explore prompt-based fine-tuning more thoroughly, since the current results indicate it can effectively bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning in this method.In summary, the main future directions are around constructing more complex and diverse training data, incorporating graph neural networks, evaluating on more tasks, using stronger language models, and leveraging prompt tuning. Advancing in these areas could further improve the capability for logical reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new self-supervised pre-training method called MERIT for improving logical reasoning abilities of language models. The key ideas are using a meta-path strategy to extract logical structures from unlabeled text and construct training instances for contrastive learning, and employing counterfactual data augmentation to eliminate shortcuts from world knowledge in pre-trained models. Specifically, they build an entity-level graph from Wikipedia passages and extract meta-paths between entity pairs to generate positive context-answer training pairs. Negative instances are created by modifying relations in the path via entity replacement. Counterfactual data is generated by replacing entities to create examples contradictory to world knowledge. The method is evaluated by further pre-training RoBERTa and ALBERT models, showing significant improvements over strong baselines on ReClor and LogiQA logical reasoning benchmarks. Ablations demonstrate the importance of both the meta-path and counterfactual strategies. The approach provides a novel way to inject symbolic logic into neural models via self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new self-supervised pre-training method called MERIT to improve logical reasoning abilities of language models. The key innovation is using a meta-path guided contrastive learning approach to automatically construct training data from unlabeled text. Specifically, the meta-path strategy is used to extract potential logical structures from raw text by building an entity-level graph from documents. This allows generating positive training instances as context-answer pairs that are logically consistent. Negative instances are created by modifying relations in the positive pairs to break consistency. Additionally, a counterfactual data augmentation technique is used to avoid shortcuts from world knowledge in pre-trained models. The model is pre-trained with contrastive learning on unlabeled Wikipedia data and then fine-tuned on downstream logical reasoning tasks. Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA benchmarks show the approach outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of meta-path guided contrastive learning for improving logical reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes MERIt, a meta-path guided contrastive learning method for logical reasoning. The key idea is to perform self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled text data to enhance the model's ability to capture logical relations. The method has two main components - meta-path guided data construction and counterfactual data augmentation. For data construction, a meta-path strategy is used to extract positive context-answer pairs from Wikipedia documents that conform to a logical structure. Negative pairs are generated by modifying the relations in the positive pairs to break logical consistency. To eliminate shortcuts from pre-trained language models' world knowledge, counterfactual data augmentation replaces entities to make even positive examples contradict commonsense. The constructed data is used to pre-train ALBERT and RoBERTa models with contrastive learning objectives. The pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on downstream logical reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ReClor and LogiQA benchmarks.
