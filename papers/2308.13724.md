# ISR-LLM: Iterative Self-Refined Large Language Model for Long-Horizon   Sequential Task Planning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes ISR-LLM, a new framework for using large language models (LLMs) to address long-horizon sequential task planning. The key idea is to integrate an iterative self-refinement process into LLMs to improve the feasibility and correctness of generated plans. 2. It introduces two types of validators for providing feedback to the LLM planner during self-refinement: an LLM-based self-validator and an external validator using auxiliary tools. The self-validator enables iterative improvements without extra implementation effort.3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of ISR-LLM across three different planning domains - cooking, blocksworld, and ball moving. The results show ISR-LLM achieves higher success rates compared to prior LLM-based planners, while retaining natural language input flexibility.4. It provides insights into the impacts of different LLMs, the LLM translator, planning complexity, and validator types on the performance of LLM-based planning.In summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating iterative self-refinement into LLMs can enhance their performance in complex, long-horizon sequential task planning. The paper provides evidence to support this through empirical evaluations across diverse planning domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a novel framework called ISR-LLM that aims to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for long-horizon sequential task planning. The key ideas presented in the paper are:- ISR-LLM utilizes an iterative self-refinement process to enhance the correctness and feasibility of plans generated by LLMs. - It consists of three main steps:   1) Preprocessing where an LLM translator converts natural language instructions into PDDL formulations.   2) Planning where an LLM planner generates an initial plan.    3) Iterative self-refinement where a validator examines the plan and provides feedback for revisions.- Two types of validators are explored - an LLM-based self-validator and an external validator using auxiliary tools.- Experiments across three different planning domains demonstrate that ISR-LLM achieves higher success rates compared to baseline LLM planning approaches.- It preserves the flexibility of LLMs to work with natural language while improving their reliability for planning tasks.In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the ISR-LLM framework that integrates iterative self-refinement to enhance LLM-based planning for long-horizon sequential tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new framework called ISR-LLM that utilizes iterative self-refinement with feedback from a validator to improve the performance of large language models in complex, long-horizon sequential task planning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of long-horizon sequential task planning:- The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning is an emerging trend, as LLMs have shown strong capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. This paper explores utilizing LLMs for long-horizon planning specifically, which involves more complex temporal dependencies than short-term planning. Previous works have investigated LLMs for more general planning tasks.- The proposed Iterative Self-Refined LLM (ISR-LLM) framework aims to improve the correctness and feasibility of plans generated by LLMs through a self-refinement process. This differentiates it from prior works that directly use LLMs to generate plans, without any refinement. The iterative refinement is a novel aspect.- Using a validator to provide feedback to the LLM planner for self-refinement is unique. The paper examines both an LLM-based self-validator and an external PDDL validator. Prior approaches do not incorporate such focused validation and feedback.- The paper evaluates the ISR-LLM framework extensively across three different planning domains. Most prior works focus on only a single domain. Testing the generalizability across multiple domains is valuable.- Compared to classical heuristic search planners, the use of LLMs trades off optimality for more flexibility and ease of use with natural language inputs. ISR-LLM achieves higher success rates than prior LLM planning approaches, though still below classical planners.- The code release helps reproducibility. Many prior papers do not provide code. The implementation details in the paper and code can inform future development of LLM-based planning systems.In summary, this paper pushes forward the use of LLMs for automated planning in a novel direction through refinement learning. The rigorous experiments demonstrate promising capabilities on complex long-horizon planning tasks.
