# [AdsorbRL: Deep Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Inverse   Catalysts Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02308)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Catalyst design is critical for clean energy technologies but computationally expensive. Machine learning can help accelerate this but inverse catalyst design is challenging.
- Key descriptor is adsorption energy - binding strength of molecules to catalyst surface. Ideally we want intermediate strength binding. 
- Multi-objective design is important - want strong binding for some molecules, weak for others.
- Limited experimental data available compared to vast chemical search space. Hard reinforcement learning problem.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce AdsorbRL - a deep reinforcement learning agent to traverse chemical space and identify optimal catalysts given a multi-objective binding energy target.
- Train on Materials Project and Open Catalyst 2020 data sets. State space is unary/binary/ternary compounds of 55 elements. 
- Test Deep Q-Networks with goal conditioning and multiple binding energy objectives.
- Propose constrained action space methods: random edge traversal; sub-sampling objectives during training.

Contributions:
- First application of deep RL to inverse catalyst design problem and multi-objective formulation.
- Random edge traversal algorithm to simplify action space. 
- Multi-objective DQN with sub-sampling objectives for improved exploration.
- Show RL agent can optimize multiple binding energies simultaneously. Improves by ~0.8eV on average.
- Novel approaches for goal-conditioned multi-obj RL in materials spaces.
- Reinforcement learning enables complex rewards and criteria hard to encode otherwise.

In summary, the paper pioneers deep RL with constrained action spaces and multi-objective formulations to effectively traverse chemical spaces for optimal catalyst discovery given experimental data sparsity and binding energy criteria.
