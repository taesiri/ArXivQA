# [Building Efficient and Effective OpenQA Systems for Low-Resource   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03590)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Question answering (QA) systems have made rapid progress for English, but progress for other languages is constrained by lack of training data. Creating new datasets is costly (e.g. SQuAD cost over $50k).
- Standard QA requires gold passages with answers, but open domain QA (OpenQA) only requires questions and can retrieve relevant passages, better reflecting real-world use.

Proposed Solution:
- Use machine translation to create QA training sets for low-resource languages. May be noisy but shows utility.
- Compile relevant passages into a knowledge source for the target language.
- Train an OpenQA system with:
   - Neural retriever to retrieve relevant passages given a question
   - Reader to extract an answer from the retrieved passages
- Only need a small gold test set (200 examples) for evaluation.

Key Contributions:  
- Propose cost-effective method for building OpenQA systems for low-resource languages without gold training data
- Apply method to Turkish using SQuAD dataset translated to Turkish (\SQUADTR)
- Show only a few hundred examples needed for evaluation
- Build OpenQA system using ColBERT-QA, adapted for Turkish
- Turkish OpenQA system gets within 88% of upper bound from standard Turkish QA
- Make code, data and models publicly available to facilitate research

In summary, the key insight is that the move from standard QA to OpenQA enables building effective QA systems for new languages quickly and cheaply by utilizing machine translation and compiling an in-language knowledge source. Just a small gold evaluation set is then sufficient for assessment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and demonstrates a cost-effective method to build open-domain question answering systems for low-resource languages by using machine translation to create training data and only a small set of human-translated question-answer pairs for evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a cost-effective method to build open domain question answering (OpenQA) systems for low-resource languages without requiring a gold training dataset. The key ideas are:

1) Using machine translation to obtain a noisy training dataset by translating an existing English QA dataset like SQuAD into the target language.

2) Compiling an in-language knowledge source to retrieve passages from for answering questions. 

3) Training an neural retriever in a weakly supervised manner using the machine translated training set and the knowledge source.

4) Training an extractive reader using the machine translated training set where contexts are provided by the retriever.

5) Showing that only a small evaluation set (as low as 200 examples) is needed to reliably evaluate OpenQA systems.

The paper demonstrates this method by building an OpenQA system for Turkish and introducing SQuAD-TR, a machine translated version of SQuAD 2.0. The results show that effective OpenQA systems can be developed for low-resource languages in a cost-effective manner without needing a human-labeled training set.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Question answering (QA)
- Open domain question answering (OpenQA) 
- Low-resource languages
- Machine translation
- Turkish
- SQuAD-TR
- ColBERT-QA
- Wikipedia
- Retriever 
- Reader
- Exact match (EM)
- F1 score

The paper focuses on building open domain QA systems for low-resource languages like Turkish in a cost-effective way, using machine translation and Wikipedia as a knowledge source. Key models explored are ColBERT-QA for the retriever and BERTurk for the reader. Main evaluation metrics are EM and F1 scores on a translated version of the SQuAD dataset called SQuAD-TR.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using machine translation to create training datasets for question answering in low-resource languages. What are some potential issues with relying on machine translation and how might the authors mitigate those?

2. The paper relies on Cross-lingual QA datasets like XQuAD for evaluation. What are some limitations of using cross-lingual evaluation sets and how could more reliable in-language evaluations be obtained?

3. The paper shows that expanding the knowledge source leads to better model performance. What factors contribute to this improvement and how can the knowledge source be further improved? 

4. The authors find that morphological tokenization does not help for the Turkish QA task. Why might this be the case given the morphological complexity of Turkish? What alternate tokenization schemes could be explored?

5. The paper proposes an extractive reader model for the QA system. What are some potential issues with extractive readers and how might more advanced reader models like generative readers help?

6. How robust is the quantitative evaluation presented in the paper given the noise in the machine-translated training data? What additional qualitative analyses could strengthen the evaluation?  

7. The paper relies heavily on the English SQuAD dataset. How well does this dataset cover the breadth of information needs for Turkish users? What other English datasets could complement it?

8. The paper shows a ColBERT-based retriever performs much better than BM25 and DPR. Why does ColBERT work better in this setting and how can it be improved further?

9. The paper finds that only a small gold evaluation set is needed. But how reliable is this conclusion given variance across questions? How could more stability be obtained?

10. The paper focuses only on factoid QA. How could the method be extended to conversational QA over multiple turns? What additional components would be needed?
