# [Learning from Visual Demonstrations through Differentiable Nonlinear MPC   for Personalized Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to develop a personalized autonomous driving controller that can imitate different human driving styles while satisfying safety constraints. Specifically, the goals are to: (1) learn from raw sensor data like images rather than handcrafted features, (2) leverage nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to ensure safety and constraints satisfaction, (3) learn the mapping from images to control actions in an end-to-end differentiable manner, and (4) evaluate on a high-fidelity vehicle model and hexapod motion simulator platform.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes DriViDOC - a model for Driving from Vision through Differentiable Optimal Control. It combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a differentiable NMPC in an end-to-end driving model. The CNN processes raw images to produce a latent representation, which is passed to fully-connected layers that predict dynamic parameters for the NMPC objective function. By making the NMPC differentiable, gradients can be backpropagated through it to train the whole model end-to-end via behavioral cloning on human driving demonstrations. This allows learning a mapping from images to low-level control actions that imitates different driving styles.

Contributions:
1) Development of DriViDOC - an end-to-end pipeline with a CNN feeding into a differentiable NMPC for personalized autonomous driving
2) Behavioral cloning on a diverse human driving dataset collected on a hexapod simulator platform 
3) Closed-loop evaluation showing DriViDOC can successfully imitate different styles
4) Analysis of visualized NMPC parameters providing insights into achieved driving behaviors  
5) Benchmarking indicating DriViDOC outperforms baselines in imitation metrics, with a 20% average improvement attributable to raw images input and differentiable NMPC training

In summary, the key ideas are using differentiable NMPC for end-to-end learning from images to low-level control, leveraging behavioral cloning on human demonstrations for personalized imitation, and evaluating on a high-fidelity simulator platform. The results demonstrate better imitation of driving styles compared to other approaches.
