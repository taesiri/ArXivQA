# [Cross-GAN Auditing: Unsupervised Identification of Attribute Level   Similarities and Differences between Pretrained Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we perform an unsupervised, attribute-level comparison between two generative adversarial networks (GANs) in order to identify similarities and differences between them? 

The key ideas proposed in the paper to address this question are:

1) Introducing a cross-GAN auditing (xGA) framework that automatically discovers and categorizes attributes into:

- Common: Attributes shared between the GANs
- Missing: Attributes present in the reference GAN but not the client GAN 
- Novel: Attributes present in the client GAN but not the reference GAN

2) Using a robust feature extractor to enable effective alignment of attributes across GANs, even when there are challenging distribution shifts between them.

3) Leveraging the idea that attribute manipulations unique to one GAN will be out-of-distribution for the other GAN, allowing discovery of missing/novel attributes. 

4) Introducing quantitative metrics to evaluate the quality of discovered common, missing, and novel attributes.

5) Demonstrating through experiments on StyleGANs trained on various datasets that xGA provides an effective fine-grained characterization of similarities and differences between GAN models.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by discovering aligned attributes across GANs and identifying unique attributes, the proposed xGA framework enables interpretable auditing and comparison of generative models. The paper aims to demonstrate the viability of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing cross-GAN auditing (xGA), a new framework for comparing and auditing generative adversarial networks (GANs) by identifying semantic attributes that are common, novel, or missing between a client GAN model and a reference GAN model. 

2. Proposing a new optimization strategy to align and discover attributes across unrelated GAN models trained on different datasets. This enables xGA to work even when the GANs have different architectures and are trained on data with distribution shifts.

3. Introducing new metrics to quantitatively evaluate and benchmark attribute-based GAN auditing methods.

4. Evaluating xGA on a variety of StyleGAN models trained on datasets like CelebA, Toons, Disney, MetFaces, etc. The results demonstrate that xGA can effectively characterize similarities and differences between GANs in an interpretable way.

5. Providing a suite of controlled experiments and ablations to analyze different components of xGA, such as the choice of feature extractor and effectiveness of the optimization approach.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new cross-GAN auditing framework that can discover and align semantic attributes to characterize and compare generative models in a human-interpretable way, even when the models are trained independently on different data distributions. The paper provides both qualitative results and quantitative benchmarking to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.
