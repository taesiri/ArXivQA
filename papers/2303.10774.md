# [Cross-GAN Auditing: Unsupervised Identification of Attribute Level   Similarities and Differences between Pretrained Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we perform an unsupervised, attribute-level comparison between two generative adversarial networks (GANs) in order to identify similarities and differences between them? 

The key ideas proposed in the paper to address this question are:

1) Introducing a cross-GAN auditing (xGA) framework that automatically discovers and categorizes attributes into:

- Common: Attributes shared between the GANs
- Missing: Attributes present in the reference GAN but not the client GAN 
- Novel: Attributes present in the client GAN but not the reference GAN

2) Using a robust feature extractor to enable effective alignment of attributes across GANs, even when there are challenging distribution shifts between them.

3) Leveraging the idea that attribute manipulations unique to one GAN will be out-of-distribution for the other GAN, allowing discovery of missing/novel attributes. 

4) Introducing quantitative metrics to evaluate the quality of discovered common, missing, and novel attributes.

5) Demonstrating through experiments on StyleGANs trained on various datasets that xGA provides an effective fine-grained characterization of similarities and differences between GAN models.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by discovering aligned attributes across GANs and identifying unique attributes, the proposed xGA framework enables interpretable auditing and comparison of generative models. The paper aims to demonstrate the viability of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing cross-GAN auditing (xGA), a new framework for comparing and auditing generative adversarial networks (GANs) by identifying semantic attributes that are common, novel, or missing between a client GAN model and a reference GAN model. 

2. Proposing a new optimization strategy to align and discover attributes across unrelated GAN models trained on different datasets. This enables xGA to work even when the GANs have different architectures and are trained on data with distribution shifts.

3. Introducing new metrics to quantitatively evaluate and benchmark attribute-based GAN auditing methods.

4. Evaluating xGA on a variety of StyleGAN models trained on datasets like CelebA, Toons, Disney, MetFaces, etc. The results demonstrate that xGA can effectively characterize similarities and differences between GANs in an interpretable way.

5. Providing a suite of controlled experiments and ablations to analyze different components of xGA, such as the choice of feature extractor and effectiveness of the optimization approach.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new cross-GAN auditing framework that can discover and align semantic attributes to characterize and compare generative models in a human-interpretable way, even when the models are trained independently on different data distributions. The paper provides both qualitative results and quantitative benchmarking to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and model auditing:

- It introduces a new method, cross-GAN auditing (xGA), for comparing and auditing different GAN models in an interpretable way by identifying common, novel, and missing attributes between them. This is a novel approach compared to prior work that focused on model-data comparisons using summary statistics like FID. 

- The idea of characterizing different GANs by their encoded attributes is related to prior work on unsupervised discovery of interpretable directions in a single GAN's latent space. However, xGA is the first to tackle joint discovery and alignment of attributes across multiple disparate GANs.

- For model auditing, xGA provides a more fine-grained analysis than prior techniques. It identifies differences between GANs based on human-interpretable semantic attributes rather than just summary metrics or fidelity measures. This is more useful for tasks like bias detection.

- The proposed method is evaluated on a wider range of GAN models and datasets than related work. Experiments include controlled studies on CelebA subsets as well as challenging cross-domain shifts like CelebA to Toons/Disney/MetFaces.

- Novel metrics are introduced to quantitatively evaluate attribute-based auditing approaches. Most prior work relied only on qualitative results or generic metrics like FID.

- xGA advances the state-of-the-art in attribute discovery by using a robust feature space, which is shown to produce more diverse and disentangled directions compared to the native latent space.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to interpretable GAN analysis and auditing by enabling fine-grained comparisons using semantic attributes. The experiments convincingly demonstrate its capabilities on diverse datasets and models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper introduces a method called cross-GAN auditing (xGA) to compare two generative adversarial networks (GANs) by automatically discovering their common, novel, and missing attributes in an unsupervised manner.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Scale cross-GAN auditing to compare multiple GANs simultaneously. The current xGA framework primarily focuses on auditing a client GAN against a single reference GAN. The authors suggest exploring extensions to enable comparative analysis between multiple GANs, with the main challenge being GPU memory constraints.

- Develop systematic solutions for choosing the feature extractor. The choice of feature space Î¦ for optimization impacts xGA's performance, requiring one that is robust to distribution shifts. The authors used advBN ResNet-50 in their experiments but suggest more work on selecting optimal feature extractors for different applications. 

- Apply cross-GAN auditing to other generative model architectures beyond StyleGAN. The experiments in the paper focus on StyleGAN models, so extending evaluation to other types of GANs and generative models is proposed.

- Evaluate on more complex datasets and distributions. Testing xGA on more complex and diverse image datasets and on datasets from other domains like audio, video, etc. is suggested.

- Develop theoretical analysis of attribute alignment. The paper empirically demonstrates xGA's ability to align attributes across GANs but formal theoretical analysis of the alignment objective is posed as an open question.

- Explore incorporating human input. Leveraging human judgment within the xGA optimization loop could help improve attribute discovery and alignment.

- Address limitations around discovering all factors of variation. While xGA outperforms baselines, providing theoretical guarantees about capturing all prominent latent factors is still an open challenge.

In summary, scaling to multiple GANs, extending beyond StyleGAN/images, integrating human input, theoretical analysis, and guaranteeing discovery of all semantic factors are highlighted as promising directions for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework called cross-GAN auditing (xGA) for identifying similarities and differences in attributes between two generative adversarial network (GAN) models. It focuses on the scenario where a new "client" GAN is compared against an established "reference" GAN, which may be unrelated or have different data distributions. xGA automatically discovers and aligns three types of attributes: common attributes shared by both models, novel attributes unique to the client, and missing attributes present only in the reference. It uses a robust feature extractor and contrastive training to align the latent spaces. Novel/missing attributes are detected by training density ratio estimation models to identify out-of-distribution samples. Experiments using StyleGANs trained on various datasets demonstrate xGA's ability to provide fine-grained characterization of GAN models even across challenging distribution shifts. The paper also introduces new metrics to evaluate attribute-based GAN auditing methods. Overall, xGA enables interpretable comparisons between GANs without reliance on summary statistics or human evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called cross-GAN auditing (xGA) for identifying attribute similarities and differences between pretrained generative adversarial networks (GANs). Given a reference GAN and a client GAN, xGA jointly discovers three types of attributes: common attributes that exist in both models, novel attributes unique to the client, and missing attributes present only in the reference. To find common attributes, xGA leverages the insight that shared attributes should induce similar image changes in both GANs. For discovering novel/missing attributes, xGA models attribute manipulations unique to one GAN as out-of-distribution samples for the other, using density ratio estimation. The proposed approach is evaluated on StyleGAN models trained on CelebA, AFHQ, FFHQ, Toons, Disney and MetFaces datasets. Both qualitative results and quantitative experiments demonstrate xGA's ability to effectively characterize similarities and differences between GAN models.

The key technical contributions are: (i) xGA is the first unified framework for cross-GAN attribute comparison; (ii) By using an external robust feature space for optimization, it achieves effective alignment even across distribution shifts; (iii) Novel metrics are introduced to quantitatively evaluate attribute-based auditing; (iv) Experiments across models trained on diverse datasets show xGA provides an interpretable characterization of GANs. Limitations include the lack of guarantees on discovering all factors of variation, and the choice of feature space affecting alignment performance. Overall, the paper presents an important advance in developing human-intelligible tools for auditing generative models.
