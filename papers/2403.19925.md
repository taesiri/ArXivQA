# [Decision Mamba: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling with   Selective State Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decision Transformer (DT) is a promising reinforcement learning approach that uses Transformer architectures for state, action, and reward sequence modeling. However, there is still room to enhance its performance further with improved sequence modeling architectures.

- The recently proposed Mamba framework has shown advanced capabilities for efficient and effective sequence modeling using selective state space models. Integrating Mamba into DT could potentially enhance its sequential decision-making abilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Decision Mamba, which incorporates the Mamba block based on selective state space models into the DT architecture. This aims to test if Mamba's efficient sequence modeling can improve DT's capabilities.

- Decision Mamba replaces DT's causal self-attention with the Mamba block while keeping other components unchanged. The Mamba block selectively extracts essential information from input sequences.

- Experiments compare Decision Mamba against DT variants on continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym and discrete action games from Atari. Performance is measured by normalized returns.

Key Outcomes:
- Empirical evaluations show Decision Mamba achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art DT models across the tasks. This validates Mamba's effectiveness for reinforcement learning problems.

- Ablation studies find Decision Mamba performs on par without channel-mixing layers, confirming the self-sufficiency of the Mamba block. Longer context modeling degrades Atari game performance, indicating fine-tuning is needed.

Main Contributions:  
- First work examining Mamba for sequential decision-making, suggesting its potency for transformer-based reinforcement learning models.

- Provides insights into architectural choices for reinforcement learning, highlighting the impact of sequence modeling techniques. 

- Opens up future work into specialized network design and hyperparameter tuning to fully exploit Mamba's capabilities on complex decision processes.
