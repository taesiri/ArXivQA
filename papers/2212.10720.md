# [MoralDial: A Framework to Train and Evaluate Moral Dialogue Systems via   Moral Discussions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10720)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems. Specifically, the authors propose a framework called MoralDial to:- Explore the communication mechanisms of morality in dialogue and resolve it into three key components: standpoint sentences/phrases, discussion state, and discusser behavior. This provides a roadmap for building a moral dialogue system. - Construct moral discussions between a simulated user and chatbot to train conversational models to express, explain, revise, and infer moral views through natural dialogue exchanges. - Evaluate the morality of dialogue systems by judging the relation between the chatbot's responses and human values in discussions. This considers the multifaceted nature of morality.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by analyzing the communication patterns of morality, constructing appropriate training data, and designing suitable evaluation metrics, it is possible to train and assess the morality of open-domain dialogue systems. The MoralDial framework encompasses the analysis, data, and evaluation methods to accomplish this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a framework called MoralDial to describe and model moral discussions. The framework explores the communication mechanisms of expressed morality and breaks it down into three components: Standpoint Sentences/Phrases, Discussion State, and Discusser Behavior. 2. Based on the framework, it constructs moral discussions to form a dataset that trains dialogue systems to learn morality through natural conversations. The dataset consists of dialogues for moral answering, explanation, revision, and inference learning.3. It presents a novel evaluation method to assess the moral performance of conversational models based on the MoralDial framework. The method evaluates different aspects of morality by judging the relation between a model's responses and human moral values during discussions.In summary, the key contribution is developing a methodology based on the MoralDial framework to effectively train and evaluate the morality of dialogue systems through tailored datasets and evaluation techniques. The framework provides a model of moral discussions and mechanisms of expressed morality that guides the training and assessment.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called MoralDial to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems by modeling the communication mechanisms of morality through constructed moral discussions between chatbots and simulated users.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on training and evaluating moral dialogue systems compares to related work:- It proposes a new framework called MoralDial to model the communication mechanisms involved in moral discussions. This provides a systematic way to analyze the requirements for a moral dialogue system. Other work has looked at incorporating rules of thumb into models, but not from this discussion modeling perspective.- The paper constructs a new moral dialogue dataset by simulating discussions around expressing, explaining, revising, and inferring moral views. This provides a natural way to train models compared to just using rule of thumb statements.- A new evaluation method is presented that judges agreement between model responses and human moral values, considering both universal and individual values. This accounts for the multifaceted nature of morality compared to prior work. - The focus is on comprehensively improving model morality across multiple components like answering, explanation, and revision. Related work has focused narrowly on aspects like detecting safety issues.- The approach trains morality directly into existing conversational models and doesn't require custom modules. Some related work has developed separate plugins for safety.So in summary, this work provides a more integrated framework, training methodology, and evaluation approach to embed morality into dialogue systems compared to prior efforts that were more piecemeal. The modeling of moral discussions is a notable new way to approach this problem.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Expanding the current framework and collecting more fine-grained moral dialogue data. The authors point out that the constructed moral discussions in the current work are limited to specific scenarios and distinct from daily dialogues. They suggest collecting more data across a wider range of moral topics and dialogue formats to enhance the framework.- Using their proposed metrics to supervise moral dialogue system training, such as through reinforcement learning. The evaluation metrics could potentially be incorporated as rewards to optimize moral performance during conversational model training.- Improving the pre-training step to be more consistent with the dialogue format. The current pre-training is done on sentence-level Rules of Thumb, whereas the downstream tasks are conversational. The authors suggest exploring pre-training in a conversational format could improve performance.- Studying how to balance moral performance and general conversational abilities. The paper focuses specifically on moral dialogue, but notes that maintaining strong general conversation skills is also important. Examining this trade-off is suggested.- Exploring potential applications such as moral debates, auxiliary moral response generation, and scenarios requiring strong morality. The authors propose their methods could be beneficial for such applications, but suggest further research on tailoring and evaluating for those use cases.In summary, the main directions are: expanding the framework, using the metrics for training supervision, improving pre-training consistency, balancing morality and general skills, and applying the methods to specific use cases. The authors see promise in the methodology but identify many open research questions to continue developing moral dialogue systems.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a framework called MoralDial to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems. The framework analyzes the communication mechanisms of morality and breaks it down into three components - standpoint sentences/phrases, discussion state, and discusser behavior. Based on this framework, the authors construct moral discussions between a simulated user and chatbot to train conversational models, incorporating expressing, explaining, revising, and inferring moral views through dialogue exchanges. They also develop a novel evaluation method under this framework that judges the relation between dialogue responses and human values across multiple facets of morality. Experiments on DialoGPT and Blenderbot show their framework is promising for training and evaluating the morality of dialogue systems. Overall, the paper provides a novel framework and methodology grounded in analyzing moral communication to improve morality in open-domain chatbots.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called MoralDial to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems. The framework breaks down morality into three components: Standpoint Sentences/Phrases, Discussion State, and Discusser Behavior. Standpoint Sentences/Phrases refer to expressions of basic moral principles or rules of thumb. Discussion State describes whether two discussers have moral alignment or conflict. Discusser Behavior relates to the dialogue acts of moral explanation and moral revision. Based on this framework, the authors construct moral discussions between simulated users and chatbots to train conversational models. The discussions contain expressions, explanations, revisions, and inferences of moral views to teach morality through natural dialogue exchanges. They also propose novel evaluation methods to judge chatbot responses in relation to human values, considering both universal and individual moral perspectives. Experiments on DialoGPT and Blenderbot show the framework helps train more moral dialogue systems. The paper provides an analysis of morality in conversations and a promising approach to developing and evaluating moral chatbots.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a framework called MoralDial to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems. The key ideas are:1. The framework models the communication mechanisms of morality in dialogue and decomposes it into three components: (a) Standpoint Sentences/Phrases expressing basic moral rules; (b) Discussion State describing moral conflict/harmony; (c) Discusser Behavior of moral explanation and revision.2. To train a conversational model under this framework, the paper constructs moral discussions between a simulated user and chatbot. The discussions contain flows of moral answering, explanation, revision and inference learning. By participating in these flows, the chatbot learns to express, explain and revise moral views naturally through dialogue exchanges. 3. For evaluation, the paper transforms judging morality to measuring the agreement between chatbot's responses and human moral values. It considers the values of the specific user, the chatbot itself, and the general population. Experiments show the framework is effective in improving chatbots' comprehensive moral abilities.In summary, the key contribution is using the proposed framework to guide the training and evaluation of moral dialogue systems via simulating moral discussions.
