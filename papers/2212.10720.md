# MoralDial: A Framework to Train and Evaluate Moral Dialogue Systems via   Moral Discussions

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems. Specifically, the authors propose a framework called MoralDial to:- Explore the communication mechanisms of morality in dialogue and resolve it into three key components: standpoint sentences/phrases, discussion state, and discusser behavior. This provides a roadmap for building a moral dialogue system. - Construct moral discussions between a simulated user and chatbot to train conversational models to express, explain, revise, and infer moral views through natural dialogue exchanges. - Evaluate the morality of dialogue systems by judging the relation between the chatbot's responses and human values in discussions. This considers the multifaceted nature of morality.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by analyzing the communication patterns of morality, constructing appropriate training data, and designing suitable evaluation metrics, it is possible to train and assess the morality of open-domain dialogue systems. The MoralDial framework encompasses the analysis, data, and evaluation methods to accomplish this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a framework called MoralDial to describe and model moral discussions. The framework explores the communication mechanisms of expressed morality and breaks it down into three components: Standpoint Sentences/Phrases, Discussion State, and Discusser Behavior. 2. Based on the framework, it constructs moral discussions to form a dataset that trains dialogue systems to learn morality through natural conversations. The dataset consists of dialogues for moral answering, explanation, revision, and inference learning.3. It presents a novel evaluation method to assess the moral performance of conversational models based on the MoralDial framework. The method evaluates different aspects of morality by judging the relation between a model's responses and human moral values during discussions.In summary, the key contribution is developing a methodology based on the MoralDial framework to effectively train and evaluate the morality of dialogue systems through tailored datasets and evaluation techniques. The framework provides a model of moral discussions and mechanisms of expressed morality that guides the training and assessment.
