# [Weak-to-Strong Generalization: Eliciting Strong Capabilities With Weak   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
As AI systems continue to become more powerful, eventually they will surpass human-level intelligence and reach superhuman capabilities. This poses an alignment challenge - how can humans ensure that such superhuman AI systems behave safely and are aligned with human values, when their behaviors will become too complex for humans to reliably evaluate or provide feedback on? The paper refers to this as the problem of "superalignment".

Methodology:
The paper proposes an analogy to study this problem today: using weak AI models to supervise stronger AI models. The weak models act as a proxy for humans, generating labels which the stronger models are trained on. The paper terms this the "weak-to-strong learning problem". The key question is whether the stronger models can generalize beyond the weak supervision to elicit their full capabilities.

Experiments and Key Results:
The paper conducts experiments by training large pretrained language models from the GPT-4 family on labels from smaller GPT-2 models, across tasks like NLP benchmarks, chess puzzles and a ChatGPT reward modeling task. Key findings include:

- Strong models consistently outperform the weak supervisors even with naive training, showing inherent generalization. But significant gaps remain compared to training with true labels.

- Methods like auxiliary confidence losses, bootstrapping and self-supervised pretraining improve generalization substantially in some tasks. For example, combining confidence loss and GPT-2 supervision recovers ~80% of the gap between GPT-2 and GPT-4 in NLP tasks.  

- Analysis shows strong models tend to overfit to errors of weak supervisors. The confidence loss mitigates this. Larger strong models also emulate weaker supervisors less.

Implications:
The results suggest that eliciting knowledge from much stronger models with weak supervision is promising but nontrivial. With more progress, techniques like this may allow aligning superhuman AI systems safely. But naive human oversight will likely not suffice without advances. Overall, the paper provides an empirical framework to make progress on the fundamental problem of superaligning advanced AI.
