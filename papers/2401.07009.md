# [Joint Extraction of Uyghur Medicine Knowledge with Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Extracting knowledge from traditional Uyghur medical texts faces challenges such as reliance on manual efforts, annotation inconsistencies, and limited coverage. Existing relation extraction methods also have issues like error propagation, insufficient consideration of dependencies, and neglect of interrelations. Moreover, transmitting sensitive medical data to cloud centers raises privacy and security concerns. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes CoEx-Bert, a joint extraction model based on parameter sharing using edge computing. It consists of two models with shared parameters that extract the main entity (S) and relation+object pair (PO) respectively. The losses of the two models are summed and backpropagation is done collaboratively. This allows end-to-end extraction of entities and relations while capturing contextual information and dependencies. Deploying on edge devices enables real-time localized extraction without transmitting sensitive data.

Main Contributions:
(1) Introduces an innovative BERT-based joint extraction model CoEx-Bert that leverages multi-task learning for simultaneous extraction of medical entities and relations.  
(2) Comprehensively evaluates the model's performance using the Uyghur medical dataset, demonstrating superior results over baselines. Achieves 90.65% accuracy.
(3) Deploys the model on edge devices to enable real-time extraction while ensuring data privacy and security.  
(4) Tests the model on authentic traditional Chinese medical texts, proving its reliability and applicability in healthcare knowledge extraction.

In summary, the paper makes notable research contributions through the proposal of CoEx-Bert for joint entity-relation extraction from Uyghur medicine texts using edge computing. The empirical analysis highlights the effectiveness of this approach.
