# ["Which LLM should I use?": Evaluating LLMs for tasks performed by   Undergraduate Computer Science Students in India](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Google Bard, GitHub Copilot, and Microsoft Copilot show promise for assisting undergraduate CS students on diverse tasks. 
- However, there is a lack of comprehensive research evaluating and comparing different LLMs on tasks commonly performed by these students.

Methodology:  
- The authors systematically evaluated 4 LLMs - ChatGPT, Google Bard, GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot across 5 common undergraduate CS tasks:
   1. Code explanation and documentation
   2. Solving class assignments 
   3. Preparing for technical interviews
   4. Learning new CS concepts/frameworks
   5. Writing emails
- For each task, a relevant dataset was created and both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to judge the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses.

Key Findings:
- No single LLM performed the best across all tasks. Each LLM showed varying competencies for different tasks:
  - Microsoft Copilot was best for code explanation, solving theoretical assignments and writing humanities assignments
  - GitHub Copilot Chat was best for solving programming assignments and technical interview preparation
  - ChatGPT was best for writing emails and on par with GitHub Copilot for technical interviews
  - Google Bard was best for explaining new CS concepts and frameworks
- The strengths and limitations of each LLM on every task were highlighted through quantitative ratings and qualitative analyses.

Recommendations:
- Guidelines provided for students and instructors to select the most appropriate LLM based on their specific needs and task type, rather than using any single LLM blindly. 
- Suggestions given for constructive usage of LLMs in line with academic integrity and avoiding plagiarism.

Main Contributions:  
- First comprehensive study evaluating and comparing multiple LLMs strictly in the context of undergraduate CS education across both technical and non-technical tasks.
- Quantitative scores and qualitative insights that can guide students and instructors in effectively leveraging the capabilities of different LLMs.
- Recommendations for judiciously using LLMs to enhance teaching and learning while exercising caution regarding accuracy.
