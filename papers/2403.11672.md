# [WIA-LD2ND: Wavelet-based Image Alignment for Self-supervised Low-Dose CT   Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Low-dose CT (LDCT) is crucial for reducing radiation exposure compared to normal-dose CT (NDCT), but the image quality is compromised. Developing methods to reduce noise in LDCT while preserving image details is important for clinical usage.  

- Existing LDCT denoising methods rely on paired or large volumes of unpaired LDCT/NDCT data, which are often unavailable. Hence self-supervised methods that use only NDCT data are needed.

- Previous self-supervised methods overlook differences between LDCT and NDCT in frequency domain, especially in high frequency components, which is key for denoising.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes LDCT denoising from a frequency perspective using discrete wavelet transform. It shows the main differences between LDCT and NDCT are in the high frequency components.  

- A Wavelet based Image Alignment (WIA) module is proposed to add noise (especially in high frequencies) to NDCT to align it with LDCT for self-supervised learning.

- A Frequency Aware Multi-scale Loss (FAM) is proposed to force the network to focus more on high frequency details during training. FAM computes loss between NDCT and reconstructed CT in multi-scale feature space.

Main Contributions:
- Provides analysis showing importance of high frequency components for LDCT denoising.

- Proposes WIA for self-supervised alignment of LDCT and NDCT using wavelets.

- Proposes FAM loss to capture high frequency details in feature space.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets using only NDCT data, demonstrating effectiveness of proposed ideas.
