# [Stateful FastConformer with Cache-based Inference for Streaming   Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have lower accuracy compared to offline models since they can only access limited future speech context. 
- Traditional streaming methods based on buffering audio chunks require redundant computations and have consistency issues between training and inference.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a cache-aware streaming FastConformer model by converting the non-autoregressive encoder to an autoregressive one using activation caching.
- Limit both past and future contexts during training for consistency with streaming inference.
- Introduce a hybrid CTC/RNNT architecture with shared encoder and two decoders to improve accuracy and convergence.

Key Contributions:
- Activation caching removes need for buffering and duplicate computations, reducing latency and speeding up inference. 
- Consistent context between training and inference reduces accuracy gap with offline models.
- Hybrid architecture improves accuracy over single decoder models, saves computation with shared encoder.
- Evaluation on LibriSpeech and large multi-domain dataset shows proposed model outperforms buffered streaming baseline in accuracy, latency and inference time.
- Model trained with multiple look-ahead latencies achieves better accuracy than single look-ahead models.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient streaming ASR model using a cache-aware FastConformer encoder and hybrid CTC/RNNT training. The consistent limited context and activation caching provides faster and more accurate streaming inference over buffer-based approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient and accurate streaming speech recognition model based on the FastConformer architecture by adapting it to have limited context, a caching mechanism to enable autoregressive inference, and a hybrid CTC/RNNT architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing an efficient streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) model based on the FastConformer architecture. The model is adapted for streaming through constraining the left and right contexts and introducing an activation caching mechanism to enable autoregressive inference while still allowing efficient non-autoregressive training.

2) Introducing a hybrid CTC/RNN-Transducer architecture with two shared-encoder decoders which improves accuracy and convergence speed compared to single decoder models. 

3) Evaluating the proposed streaming FastConformer models on LibriSpeech and a large multi-domain dataset, showing improved accuracy and reduced latency compared to buffered streaming baselines.

4) Showing that training the model with multiple look-ahead sizes leads to better accuracy compared to single look-ahead training, while enabling support for multiple latencies with one model.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient and accurate streaming ASR model based on a cached autoregressive FastConformer encoder and hybrid CTC/RNN-T decoders. The modifications enable streaming inference while retaining the efficiency of non-autoregressive training.

6. Walk through the differences between the offline, buffered streaming, and proposed cache-aware models in terms of training, architecture changes required, inference approach, accuracy results, and computational efficiency.

7. The FastEmit loss function is used in the experiments. What is FastEmit? What positive impact did using FastEmit have even for the CTC decoder? What does this demonstrate about the hybrid architecture?  

8. What causes the inconsistency between training and inference contexts for buffered streaming models? How does the proposed approach eliminate this inconsistency? Why does that help reduce the accuracy gap from offline models?
