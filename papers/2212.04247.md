# [EditableNeRF: Editing Topologically Varying Neural Radiance Fields by   Key Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to enable intuitive editing of dynamic scenes reconstructed by neural radiance fields (NeRF), including scenes with topological changes. The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a method to represent topologically varying dynamics in dynamic scenes using sparse surface key points. Each key point controls the motion of a part of the scene.- A weighted key points strategy that combines key points with spatially-varying weights to model complex motions and topological changes. - An automatic scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points based on scene dynamics.- A training method with novel losses to optimize key point positions using optical flow and depth supervision.- Multi-dimensional (up to 3D) editing by simply dragging key points to desired positions after training. Editing by key points is intuitive.- The ability to generate novel scenes not seen during training through key point control.- A fully automatic training pipeline requiring only an image sequence as input, without manual annotation.In summary, this paper focuses on making neural radiance fields editable in an intuitive way to support editing of complex dynamic scenes, including topological changes, without manual supervision. The core ideas are representing scenes by weighted surface key points and using them to enable editing.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes EditableNeRF, a method to reconstruct and edit dynamic scenes containing topological changes using neural radiance fields by automatically detecting sparse surface key points that control the dynamics and enable intuitive multi-dimensional editing of the modeled scene.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in editable neural radiance fields:- This paper focuses on enabling intuitive editing of dynamic scenes with topological changes, which many prior works do not handle well. Methods like NERF-editing, Nerfies, and D-NeRF can edit static scenes or dynamic scenes without topological changes, but cannot handle topological changes caused by discontinuous motions.- Compared to HyperNeRF which can reconstruct topologically varying scenes, this paper further enables editing by proposing an editable framework based on key points. The key points with spatial weights are optimized to model the dynamics and allow multi-dimensional editing.- Unlike CoNeRF which requires manual annotations like masks and attributes for each dynamic part, this method is trained fully automatically by analyzing the scene dynamics. It also supports more flexible editing instead of just changing 1D attribute values.- The scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points is novel, considering the dynamics and topological changes in the scene. This allows automatic and reasonable placement of key points.- The weighted key points strategy together with the motion and geometry losses enable unsupervised training of the key points. Previous editable NeRF works don't have such losses to optimize editable scene representations.- Experiments show this method handles challenging dynamic scenes and outperforms state-of-the-art methods like HyperNeRF and CoNeRF in terms of editing quality. The applications like GUI also demonstrate easy editing.Overall, I think this paper makes good progresses over prior works by tackling the challenging problem of editing dynamic scenes with topology changes. The key idea of representing the dynamics using optimized surface key points is innovative. The automatic training framework could enable more applications of editable neural radiance fields.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few future research directions in the Conclusions section:- Handling more complex scenes where the assumption that the dynamics of a canonical location mainly depend on one key point does not hold, such as a dancing human.  - Extending the method to handle semi-transparent objects like smoke, where it is hard to pick out distinct surface key points.- Improving extrapolation when key points are dragged too far from their positions in the training sequence.- Adapting the method to work with objects that only exhibit one-dimensional dynamics in the captured sequence, such as a drawer opening and closing.- Making the method more robust to failures in the RAFT optical flow or HyperNeRF depth estimation components.In summary, they suggest extending the method to handle more complex and varied scene dynamics and dynamics types, improving generalization for large edits and extrapolation, and making the overall pipeline more robust. Key challenges are handling transparency, highly articulated motion, and reliance on optical flow and depth estimation.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes EditableNeRF, a method to edit neural radiance fields (NeRF) representing dynamic scenes with topological changes. The key idea is to model the scene using sparse surface key points that control the motions and topological changes of different parts. A scene analysis method first detects these key points and initializes their positions.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes EditableNeRF, a method to edit topologically varying neural radiance fields through key points. The key idea is to represent motions and topological changes using the movements of sparse surface key points. The authors develop a scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by considering the dynamics in the input image sequence. Then a neural network is trained to reconstruct the scene using these key points. Each key point controls the dynamics and topological changes of a corresponding part of the scene. After training, users can edit the scene intuitively by dragging the key points to desired new positions. This enables multi-dimensional editing of the scene geometry and appearance. The entire pipeline is trained in a self-supervised manner using only an image sequence from a single view, without needing manual annotations.In more detail, the method first analyzes the input images to identify reference key points that exhibit large variations in their ambient coordinates over time. These sparse 3D points with high dynamics are likely involved in topological changes. Next, the reference key points are propagated across frames using optical flow and depth maps to initialize their positions. The neural network takes a query point and estimates spatially-varying weights indicating which key points affect it. A linear combination of key points weighted by these values models the topological changes at that location. The network is trained to reconstruct the input views, while also optimizing the key point positions using motion and geometry losses for supervision. After training, users can intuitively edit the scene in multiple dimensions by dragging the key points. The method supports generating novel scenes and motion transfer between sequences. Experiments demonstrate high-quality editing results on various dynamic scenes with topological changes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes EditableNeRF, an editable neural radiance field method for modeling and editing dynamic scenes with topological changes. The key idea is to represent the scene using sparse surface key points that can encode the topologically varying dynamics. A scene analysis method is first applied to detect and initialize key points by analyzing the variance of ambient coordinates from a pre-trained HyperNeRF model. The network is then trained to reconstruct the scene using a weighted key points strategy, where an MLP outputs spatially-varying weights for key points and a weighted combination of key point positions models the dynamics. Key point positions are optimized during training using supervision from optical flow and depth maps. After training, the scene can be edited intuitively by controlling the 3D positions of key points, enabling multi-dimensional editing. The method is fully automatic without needing any manual annotations.
