# [EditableNeRF: Editing Topologically Varying Neural Radiance Fields by   Key Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to enable intuitive editing of dynamic scenes reconstructed by neural radiance fields (NeRF), including scenes with topological changes. The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a method to represent topologically varying dynamics in dynamic scenes using sparse surface key points. Each key point controls the motion of a part of the scene.- A weighted key points strategy that combines key points with spatially-varying weights to model complex motions and topological changes. - An automatic scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points based on scene dynamics.- A training method with novel losses to optimize key point positions using optical flow and depth supervision.- Multi-dimensional (up to 3D) editing by simply dragging key points to desired positions after training. Editing by key points is intuitive.- The ability to generate novel scenes not seen during training through key point control.- A fully automatic training pipeline requiring only an image sequence as input, without manual annotation.In summary, this paper focuses on making neural radiance fields editable in an intuitive way to support editing of complex dynamic scenes, including topological changes, without manual supervision. The core ideas are representing scenes by weighted surface key points and using them to enable editing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing EditableNeRF, editable neural radiance fields that enable end-users to easily edit dynamic scenes even with topological changes, without requiring manual annotations for training data. The key ideas include:- Using weighted key points to model topologically varying dynamics and represent motions. Each key point controls the dynamics of a scene part. This allows intuitive editing by dragging key points.- A scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by measuring dynamics in the input sequence. - A training method with novel losses to optimize key point positions with the supervision of optical flow and depth maps.- The entire pipeline is fully automatic without manual annotations. The modeled scenes can be edited easily by controlling key point positions after training.- Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate high-quality editing results on various dynamic scenes. The method supports multi-dimensional editing and generating novel scenes unseen in the training data.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the editable neural radiance fields framework that can be trained fully automatically and enables intuitive editing on dynamic scenes with topological changes by leveraging key points. This brings new applications for editable novel-view synthesis.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes EditableNeRF, a method to reconstruct and edit dynamic scenes containing topological changes using neural radiance fields by automatically detecting sparse surface key points that control the dynamics and enable intuitive multi-dimensional editing of the modeled scene.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in editable neural radiance fields:- This paper focuses on enabling intuitive editing of dynamic scenes with topological changes, which many prior works do not handle well. Methods like NERF-editing, Nerfies, and D-NeRF can edit static scenes or dynamic scenes without topological changes, but cannot handle topological changes caused by discontinuous motions.- Compared to HyperNeRF which can reconstruct topologically varying scenes, this paper further enables editing by proposing an editable framework based on key points. The key points with spatial weights are optimized to model the dynamics and allow multi-dimensional editing.- Unlike CoNeRF which requires manual annotations like masks and attributes for each dynamic part, this method is trained fully automatically by analyzing the scene dynamics. It also supports more flexible editing instead of just changing 1D attribute values.- The scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points is novel, considering the dynamics and topological changes in the scene. This allows automatic and reasonable placement of key points.- The weighted key points strategy together with the motion and geometry losses enable unsupervised training of the key points. Previous editable NeRF works don't have such losses to optimize editable scene representations.- Experiments show this method handles challenging dynamic scenes and outperforms state-of-the-art methods like HyperNeRF and CoNeRF in terms of editing quality. The applications like GUI also demonstrate easy editing.Overall, I think this paper makes good progresses over prior works by tackling the challenging problem of editing dynamic scenes with topology changes. The key idea of representing the dynamics using optimized surface key points is innovative. The automatic training framework could enable more applications of editable neural radiance fields.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few future research directions in the Conclusions section:- Handling more complex scenes where the assumption that the dynamics of a canonical location mainly depend on one key point does not hold, such as a dancing human.  - Extending the method to handle semi-transparent objects like smoke, where it is hard to pick out distinct surface key points.- Improving extrapolation when key points are dragged too far from their positions in the training sequence.- Adapting the method to work with objects that only exhibit one-dimensional dynamics in the captured sequence, such as a drawer opening and closing.- Making the method more robust to failures in the RAFT optical flow or HyperNeRF depth estimation components.In summary, they suggest extending the method to handle more complex and varied scene dynamics and dynamics types, improving generalization for large edits and extrapolation, and making the overall pipeline more robust. Key challenges are handling transparency, highly articulated motion, and reliance on optical flow and depth estimation.
