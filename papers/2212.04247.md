# [EditableNeRF: Editing Topologically Varying Neural Radiance Fields by   Key Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to enable intuitive editing of dynamic scenes reconstructed by neural radiance fields (NeRF), including scenes with topological changes. The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a method to represent topologically varying dynamics in dynamic scenes using sparse surface key points. Each key point controls the motion of a part of the scene.- A weighted key points strategy that combines key points with spatially-varying weights to model complex motions and topological changes. - An automatic scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points based on scene dynamics.- A training method with novel losses to optimize key point positions using optical flow and depth supervision.- Multi-dimensional (up to 3D) editing by simply dragging key points to desired positions after training. Editing by key points is intuitive.- The ability to generate novel scenes not seen during training through key point control.- A fully automatic training pipeline requiring only an image sequence as input, without manual annotation.In summary, this paper focuses on making neural radiance fields editable in an intuitive way to support editing of complex dynamic scenes, including topological changes, without manual supervision. The core ideas are representing scenes by weighted surface key points and using them to enable editing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing EditableNeRF, editable neural radiance fields that enable end-users to easily edit dynamic scenes even with topological changes, without requiring manual annotations for training data. The key ideas include:- Using weighted key points to model topologically varying dynamics and represent motions. Each key point controls the dynamics of a scene part. This allows intuitive editing by dragging key points.- A scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by measuring dynamics in the input sequence. - A training method with novel losses to optimize key point positions with the supervision of optical flow and depth maps.- The entire pipeline is fully automatic without manual annotations. The modeled scenes can be edited easily by controlling key point positions after training.- Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate high-quality editing results on various dynamic scenes. The method supports multi-dimensional editing and generating novel scenes unseen in the training data.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the editable neural radiance fields framework that can be trained fully automatically and enables intuitive editing on dynamic scenes with topological changes by leveraging key points. This brings new applications for editable novel-view synthesis.
