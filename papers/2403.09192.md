# [PYRA: Parallel Yielding Re-Activation for Training-Inference Efficient   Task Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Adapting large-scale vision transformers to downstream tasks presents challenges in training overhead and inference efficiency. 
- Existing methods like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) reduce training costs but retain high inference complexity. Model compression methods enhance inference efficiency but involve heavy retraining.
- Simply combining PEFT and model compression fails to achieve both training and inference efficiency. This leads to the new challenge of "training-inference efficient task adaptation".

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Parallel Yielding Re-Activation (PYRA) method to address this challenge. 
- PYRA follows the token merging paradigm for inference efficiency. It modulates token features before merging using lightweight generators.
- Parallel yielding weights are generated to comprehensively perceive feature distributions. Re-activation strategy modulates and calibrates tokens to be merged.
- This enables adaptive calibration of features for downstream tasks with low complexity.

Main Contributions:
- Defines the new challenge of training-inference efficient task adaptation.
- Proposes PYRA involving parallel yielding weights and re-activation for token modulation to address this.
- Achieves comparable performance to baseline PEFT under low compression rate.
- Eliminates performance gap under high compression rate compared to smaller models.
- Shows consistent improvements over baselines across model architectures, scales and compression rates.
- Demonstrates PYRA as an effective approach for obtaining smaller-scale models for downstream tasks when pretrained small-scale models unavailable.

In summary, the paper identifies limitations of prior arts in achieving both training and inference efficiency for adapting vision transformers. It proposes PYRA to modulate token features in an adaptive way leading to calibrated representations. This enables training-inference efficient adaptation without significant performance loss across model variants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel Parallel Yielding Re-Activation (PYRA) method to achieve both training efficiency and inference efficiency for adapting large-scale vision transformers to downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called Parallel Yielding Re-Activation (PYRA) for training-inference efficient task adaptation of large-scale vision transformers. Specifically:

1) The paper defines a new challenge called "training-inference efficient task adaptation", which aims to enhance the inference efficiency of large-scale transformers during parameter-efficient fine-tuning on downstream tasks. 

2) The proposed PYRA method modulates token features via parallel yielding of decoupled weights and re-activation to calibrate tokens to be merged. This allows adaptive calibration of learned features for downstream tasks with low complexity.

3) Extensive experiments show that PYRA achieves negligible performance drop under low compression rate and eliminates the adverse compression gap under high compression rate, compared to baseline methods. It also generalizes well to different backbones and pre-training methods.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the PYRA method to effectively address the new challenge of training-inference efficient adaptation of large vision transformers, with superiority over existing methods demonstrated empirically.
