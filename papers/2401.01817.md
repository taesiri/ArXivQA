# [Many-Objective-Optimized Semi-Automated Robotic Disassembly Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robotic disassembly of complex products with many parts is challenging to automate. It requires determining an optimal sequence of parts considering feasibility, stability, difficulty, efficiency, prioritization of valuable parts, and human-robot task allocation. 

- Existing methods do not adequately address these multiple objectives and constraints specific to semi-automated robotic disassembly operations and planning.

Method:
- Proposes a Many-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MaOGA) inspired by NSGA-III to optimize disassembly sequence over multiple objectives. 

- Uses contact and connection graphs (CCGs) to efficiently generate stable initial sequence solutions.

- Defines constraints on order feasibility, motion feasibility and stability. Defines objectives for difficulty, efficiency, prioritization and human-robot allocability.

- NSGA-III operators used to explore trade-offs between objectives and steer towards balanced solutions.

Results: 
- Experiments on a complex 36-part belt drive unit demonstrate feasibility of generating optimized sequences satisfying constraints and balancing all objectives.

- CCG-based initialization provides 47% available initial solutions compared to almost 0% with other methods.

- Optimization achieves 100% success rate in finding available solutions, smoothly reducing objective values over generations.

Contributions:
- Novel formulation of robotic disassembly sequence optimization as a constrained multi-objective problem.

- Design of objective functions and constraints tailored to semi-automated robotic disassembly.  

- Use of CCGs and NSGA-III for repeatable, stable exploration of quality solutions.

- Demonstration of the approach on a complex 36-part product, generating feasible sequences and motions.

The key novelty is in addressing robotic disassembly automation through multi-objective optimization, using CCGs and NSGA-III to repeatedly find good, balanced solutions across multiple practical objectives.

 This paper proposes a many-objective genetic algorithm to optimize semi-automated robotic disassembly sequences by considering constraints on feasibility and stability as well as objectives related to difficulty, efficiency, prioritization, and allocability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for many-objective sequence optimization for semi-automated robotic disassembly operations. Specifically:

1) They employ a many-objective genetic algorithm (MaOGA) inspired by NSGA-III to optimize the disassembly sequence by considering constraints and multiple objective functions relevant to robotic disassembly. 

2) They propose a contact and connection graph (CCG) based method to efficiently generate stable and interference-free initial chromosome solutions for the MaOGA.

3) They design constraints and objective functions tailored for semi-automated robotic disassembly operations, including feasibility, stability, difficulty, efficiency, prioritization and allocability.

4) Their experiments on a complex product with 36 parts demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently find optimal disassembly sequences that satisfy the constraints and optimize the multiple objectives for enabling robotic disassembly operations.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an optimization framework that can generate robot-oriented disassembly sequences for complex products by utilizing CCG-based initialization and a NSGA-III inspired many-objective genetic algorithm with tailored constraints and objectives.
