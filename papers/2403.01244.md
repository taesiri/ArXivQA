# [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models with   Self-Synthesized Rehearsal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained continually on new data, forgetting previously learned knowledge. 
- Existing rehearsal-based methods require access to previous training data to mitigate forgetting, which may not be feasible in real-world applications.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Self-Synthesized Rehearsal (SSR) framework to generate synthetic rehearsal data using the LLM itself. 
- It employs in-context learning with the base LLM to generate initial synthetic instances.
- The latest LLM then refines the synthetic outputs to preserve its current knowledge. 
- High-quality and diverse synthetic instances are selected via clustering for rehearsal.

Main Contributions:
- SSR achieves superior or comparable performance to conventional rehearsal methods without requiring previous real training data.
- It is more data-efficient, only needing a small set of demonstrations for in-context learning.
- Experiments show SSR effectively preserves model performance on seen tasks and generalization capability on unseen tasks/datasets.  
- Analysis demonstrates the effects of different SSR components and shows synthetic instances can benefit optimization.
- SSR presents a promising and flexible solution for practical continual learning of LLMs without reliance on previous data availability.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel rehearsal-based continual learning framework called SSR that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in LLMs by leveraging the model's own capability to generate synthetic rehearsal data. Experiments and analysis validate its effectiveness.
