# [Data Management For Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01700)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of current research on data management strategies for large language models (LLMs), focusing on both the pretraining and supervised fine-tuning stages. In pretraining, it reviews work on optimizing data quantity, quality, domain composition, and integrated data management systems. Key topics include scaling laws governing dataset size, the impact of data repetition, deduplication, quality and toxicity filtering, balancing domain mixtures, and new data processing pipelines. For supervised fine-tuning, it summarizes research on data quantity, instruction quality, diversity and complexity, prompt design, task composition, and data-efficient learning methods. It highlights tensions in the field regarding scaling laws, task composition strategies, and the efficacy of different data management techniques. Finally, it outlines open challenges around achieving holistic understanding, constructing general frameworks, addressing model hallucinations, and mitigating social biases. The paper serves as a valuable guide for practitioners aiming to develop powerful LLMs through effective data management.
