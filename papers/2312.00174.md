# [Compression of end-to-end non-autoregressive image-to-speech system for   low-resourced devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
People with visual impairments have difficulty accessing touchscreen devices like phones and laptops. Existing solutions like screen readers have limitations. End-to-end image-to-speech (ITS) systems can help mitigate this problem by reading screen content aloud. However, state-of-the-art ITS models have huge memory footprints making deployment on resource-constrained devices very difficult.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a compressed end-to-end neural ITS architecture to enable text-to-speech from display images, while being efficient enough to deploy on low-resource devices. The key ideas are:

1) Replace CNN-based image encoder with a compact Vision Transformer (ViT) based scene text recognizer model to improve accuracy and reduce parameters.

2) Employ knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a larger "teacher" ViT model to a smaller "student" model to reduce parameters from 3.87 million to 1.2 million.

3) Reduce the number of layers in the mel-spectrogram decoder module to further compress the model.

4) Remove computationally expensive image rectification components and instead rely on augmented training data.

Main Contributions:

- Propose a compressed end-to-end ITS model with 2.46 million parameters - 67.2% smaller than prior work.

- Reduce inference time by 22.2% compared to baseline, enabling quicker audio feedback.  

- Achieve high compression ratio with minimal drop in accuracy (2-3% word accuracy reduction).

- Demonstrate the model can be effectively trained without an image rectification stage.

The reduced model size and faster inference time make the solution feasible to deploy on resource-constrained devices to assist visually impaired users. Human evaluation shows compressed model output quality is comparable to the larger baseline model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a compressed end-to-end image-to-speech model using vision transformers and knowledge distillation that reduces parameters by 60% and speeds up inference by 22% with only a small drop in accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be developing a compressed end-to-end neural architecture for an image-to-speech system that can be deployed on low-resource devices. Specifically:

- They introduced a vision transformers-based image encoder to improve the accuracy of the image-to-speech system. 

- They utilized knowledge distillation to compress the model from 6.1 million parameters down to 2.46 million parameters, resulting in a 59.7% reduction in model size. 

- The smaller model size leads to reduced inference time, decreasing the delay between a user touching a word and the audio being generated. They reported a 22.2% speedup in inference time.

- They show through human and automatic evaluations that the compression leads to only a minimal 2-3% drop in accuracy and 1-2% increase in phoneme error rate.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing a much smaller and faster image-to-speech model using knowledge distillation and vision transformers, while maintaining good performance. This allows the model to be deployed on low-resource devices efficiently to assist visually impaired users.
