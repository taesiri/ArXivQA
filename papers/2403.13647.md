# [Meta-Point Learning and Refining for Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13647)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Meta-Point Learning and Refining for Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation":

Problem:
- Existing pose estimation methods are trained on category-specific data and cannot generalize to novel classes, especially those with different keypoint definitions. 
- Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) aims to predict keypoints for arbitrary objects given a few support images showing desired keypoints.
- Existing CAPE methods rely only on local features extracted at sparse support keypoints, which is inadequate. They do not exploit inherent universal information about keypoints.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose to learn class-agnostic "meta-points" that reveal inherency of keypoints and serve as high-quality proposals for downstream tasks.
- Maintain learnable meta-embeddings to capture universal keypoint information. Make them interact with image features to produce meta-point proposals without any support.
- Assign identities to meta-points based on support keypoints using bipartite matching.
- Refine assigned meta-points to desired coordinates using support features and mined universal information.
- Propose progressive deformable point decoder to progressively decode precise keypoints.
- Propose slacked regression loss to avoid immature supervision.

Main Contributions:
- First to learn class-agnostic potential keypoints (meta-points) for CAPE task.
- Propose CAPE framework based on meta-point learning and refining. Meta-points facilitate prediction.
- Minor contributions: progressive deformable point decoder and slacked regression loss. 
- Comprehensive experiments show proposed method reveals keypoint inherency via meta-points and also predicts more precise keypoints than prior CAPE methods.
