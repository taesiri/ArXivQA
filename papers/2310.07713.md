# [InstructRetro: Instruction Tuning post Retrieval-Augmented Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07713)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How does continued pretraining of large language models with retrieval augmentation, followed by instruction tuning, impact their performance on question answering tasks?

Specifically, the authors are investigating whether scaling up a retrieval-augmented language model called Retro to 48 billion parameters, and then applying instruction tuning, can improve performance on question answering compared to a baseline GPT model of comparable size that did not utilize retrieval augmentation. 

The key hypothesis seems to be that the combination of retrieval-augmented pretraining and instruction tuning will unlock additional capabilities in large language models, enabling them to better leverage retrieved knowledge when answering questions. The authors hypothesize this training recipe can yield a better decoder for question answering compared to standard pretraining and instruction tuning.

In summary, the core research question is whether and how much continued pretraining with retrieval, plus instruction tuning, can enhance the zero-shot QA abilities of large language models compared to strong baselines like GPT and InstructGPT. The paper aims to demonstrate the value of their proposed InstructRetro model and training methodology.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing InstructRetro 48B, which is the largest language model pretrained with retrieval before instruction tuning. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Scaling up Retro, a retrieval-augmented language model, to 48B parameters by continuing to pretrain a 43B GPT model on additional 100B tokens while retrieving from a corpus of 1.2 trillion tokens. This results in a foundation model called Retro 48B that achieves significantly lower perplexity than the original GPT 43B.

2. Applying instruction tuning to Retro 48B, yielding a model called InstructRetro 48B. Experiments show that InstructRetro 48B outperforms its GPT counterpart (GPT-Instruct 43B) on several question answering datasets, especially on long-form QA where the average improvement is 10%.

3. Ablation studies showing that the decoder backbone alone of InstructRetro can achieve comparable performance as using the full model. This highlights the potential of obtaining a better GPT decoder through continued pretraining with retrieval before instruction tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a training recipe of scaling up retrieval-augmented pretraining followed by instruction tuning, which results in improved language models for question answering. The paper unveils the potential of this recipe through introducing and experimenting with InstructRetro 48B.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces InstructRetro, a 48 billion parameter language model pretrained with retrieval augmentation and then further enhanced with instruction tuning, which achieves strong performance on question answering tasks compared to similarly sized models without retrieval augmentation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some comparisons between this paper and other related research:

- This paper focuses on scaling up retrieval-augmented pretraining, while most prior work has studied retrieval augmentation primarily on medium-sized models (~10B parameters). This paper shows the benefits of scaling up retrieval-augmented pretraining to 48B parameters.

- The technique of continuing pretraining with retrieval on an existing pretrained foundation model is related to "retro-fitting" from the Retro paper. However, this paper makes an important change of unfreezing the decoder during continued pretraining, while Retro froze the decoder. This paper shows unfreezing helps optimization and downstream performance.

- For instruction tuning, this paper uses a simple but effective blend of supervised instruction datasets. Other related work has explored reinforcement learning from human feedback. This paper demonstrates good results can be achieved even without human feedback data.

- After instruction tuning, this paper shows that the retrieval-augmented model InstructRetro significantly outperforms its non-augmented counterpart GPT-Instruct. This highlights the benefits of combining retrieval-augmented pretraining with instruction tuning.

- An interesting finding is that simply using the decoder of InstructRetro, without the encoder, can match the performance of the full model. This suggests the decoder may be capturing most of the benefits, opening up further research directions. 

- Compared to other state-of-the-art models on question answering like LaMDA and PaLM, InstructRetro shows very competitive performance, despite being smaller in scale. This suggests promise for the approach presented here.

In summary, this paper provides valuable scaling results and insights about retrieval-augmented pretraining combined with instruction tuning on modern large language models. The comparisons show the potential of this approach to improve language understanding.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions:

- Exploring different methods for integrating retrieved knowledge into language models, beyond the encoder-decoder and chunk-wise cross-attention approaches studied in this work. They suggest transformer variants like the sparse transformer could be promising.

- Pretraining larger retrieval-augmented language models, to further understand how model scale affects the benefits of retrieval augmentation. 

- Creating better benchmarks to evaluate the factual accuracy and generalization abilities of retrieval-augmented language models. The existing benchmarks have limitations.

- Improving retrieval through better prompt/query formulation and reranking methods. There is still room to improve retrieval quality.

- Studying whether and how much the benefits of retrieval-augmentation depend on the domain or style of the test data. Generalization to out-of-domain data is still a challenge.

- Exploring different data sources for retrieval, beyond just using the pretraining corpus. Incorporating external knowledge bases could be beneficial.

- Developing methods to do retrieval-augmented finetuning, instead of just pretraining. Finetuning with dynamic retrieval could help adapt models.

- Studying retrieval-augmentation for modalities beyond just text, such as images, audio and video.

In summary, the authors highlight many interesting open problems around developing better retrieval mechanisms, scaling up models, creating better benchmarks, and adapting models with retrieval.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions based on the work presented in this paper:

1. Explore different methods for incorporating retrieval into language model pre-training, such as using hybrid encoder-decoder architectures like T5 or injecting retrieved knowledge directly into the self-attention layers of the decoder. 

2. Scale up the size of retrieval-augmented language models to hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters, as larger models may be better able to integrate retrieved knowledge.

3. Construct high-quality retrieval-augmented instruction tuning datasets to further improve the ability of models like Retro to follow instructions while utilizing retrieved knowledge.

4. Evaluate retrieval-augmented language models on a broader range of downstream tasks beyond just QA, such as summarization, dialogue, and open-ended generation tasks.

5. Perform human evaluations and user studies to assess whether the improvements seen on benchmark datasets translate to enhanced performance in real-world applications.

6. Explore retrieving structured knowledge in addition to free text passages to provide more precise, factual information to language models.

7. Analyze the knowledge and capabilities gained through retrieval-augmented pre-training to better understand these models.

In summary, the authors highlight scaling up model size, using different architectures, constructing better datasets, evaluating on more tasks, and analyzing model knowledge as promising directions for future work on pre-training language models with retrieval.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper introduces InstructRetro, a large language model with 48 billion parameters that is pretrained with retrieval augmentation and then instruction tuned. InstructRetro starts with a 43 billion parameter GPT model pretrained on 1.1 trillion tokens. It then continues pretraining this model with retrieval on an additional 100 billion tokens, while retrieving from a database of 1.2 trillion tokens. This continued pretraining with retrieval yields the foundation model Retro 48B, which demonstrates significantly improved perplexity over the original GPT 43B model. After instruction tuning Retro 48B, the resulting model InstructRetro 48B shows substantial gains in accuracy on zero-shot question answering tasks compared to an equivalently sized instruction-tuned GPT baseline. Experiments on 12 QA datasets, including both short-form and more challenging long-form QA, show average relative gains of 7-10% over the GPT baseline. Ablation studies reveal that both the continued pretraining with retrieval and instruction tuning are critical to achieving these accuracy gains. The results highlight the benefit of scaling up retrieval augmented pretraining before instruction tuning to obtain improved question answering performance.

The paper introduces InstructRetro, a large language model pretrained with retrieval and then instruction tuning. Specifically, they take a pretrained 43B parameter GPT model and continue pretraining it with retrieval augmentation on an additional 100 billion tokens while retrieving from a corpus of 1.2 trillion tokens. This yields the foundation model Retro 48B. Compared to the original GPT model, Retro 48B significantly improves perplexity on held-out data. The authors then apply instruction tuning to Retro 48B, obtaining the model InstructRetro 48B. Through extensive experiments on question answering tasks, they find that InstructRetro outperforms the comparable instruction-tuned GPT model on both short-form and especially long-form QA. For example, averaged over 8 short QA datasets, InstructRetro improves accuracy by 7% over the GPT baseline. On long-form QA tasks the gain is even higher, around 10%. Ablation studies confirm the importance of both the retrieval-augmented pretraining and instruction tuning stages. Interestingly, the authors also find that InstructRetro obtains strong performance even without using its encoder during evaluation, essentially performing as a GPT decoder, highlighting the benefit of pretraining with retrieval before instruction tuning as a recipe for obtaining a better GPT decoder for QA tasks.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called InstructRetro for pretraining large language models with retrieval to improve performance on question answering tasks. The key steps are: 1) Start with a large pretrained auto-regressive language model like GPT with over 40 billion parameters. 2) Further pretrain this model using a retrieval augmented pretraining method called Retro-fitting, where the model retrieves relevant context from a large corpus to condition its predictions during pretraining.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is introducing InstructRetro, which is a 48 billion parameter language model pretrained with retrieval before instruction tuning. The key ideas and aims of the paper are:

1. Scaling up Retro, a retrieval-augmented auto-regressive language model, to 48 billion parameters. This is the largest LLM pretrained with retrieval. The goal is to improve the model's capabilities by leveraging more parameters and data.

2. Continuing to pretrain the 43B GPT model with retrieval on an additional 100 billion tokens to obtain Retro 48B. This aims to improve the model's perplexity and ability to incorporate factual knowledge compared to just pretraining the GPT model alone without retrieval. 

3. Applying instruction tuning to Retro 48B to create InstructRetro 48B. This fine-tunes the model to follow natural language instructions, with the goal of improving performance on downstream QA tasks.

4. Evaluating InstructRetro on question answering and showing it outperforms the same architecture pretrained and tuned without retrieval. This demonstrates the benefits of retrieval-augmented pretraining combined with instruction tuning.

5. Ablation studies showing both components are important - retrieval pretraining and instruction tuning unlock the potential of the model.

6. Finding comparable performance can be achieved even without the Retro encoder, highlighting the promise of obtaining a better QA model by pretraining the GPT decoder with retrieval before instruction tuning.

In summary, the key aim is scaling up and improving an auto-regressive LM with retrieval-augmented pretraining and instruction tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on QA tasks. The results show the benefits of this training recipe.
