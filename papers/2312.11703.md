# [Shaping Political Discourse using multi-source News Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Multi-document news summarization to generate unbiased, concise overviews covering diverse arguments/opinions is challenging. Issues include high redundancy, temporality of information, co-reference resolution, robustness to imbalanced coverage of aspects, summarizing different perspectives on the same aspect, and combining argument summaries.

Proposed Solutions:
- Unsupervised Pipeline Model with 4 stages - selection, clustering, summarization, combination 
- Supervised End-to-End Model using modified BertSum with additional diversity loss 

Key Contributions:
- Selection subset of sentences using argument mining to reduce input size
- Handle redundancy via clustering using KMeans++ or agglomerative clustering on BERT embeddings 
- Summarize opinions in each cluster to cover different perspectives
- Concatenate per-cluster summaries  
- Modified BertSum loss to encourage diversity of selected sentences

The unsupervised pipeline aims to separate out aspects of a topic into clusters first before summarizing opinions. The supervised model directly summarizes from multiple documents but optimizes for diversity. Evaluation using standard DUC dataset and a manually curated polarized news dataset shows higher performance for the end-to-end model. Impact is helping reduce bias for readers by emphasizing diversity of opinions summarized.
