## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing unsupervised skeleton-based action recognition methods suffer from severe overfitting due to the difficulty in choosing relevant negative samples. This limits their performance. 
- Skeleton data is already a relatively high-level representation. Standard unsupervised learning tends to produce features that discriminate samples directly rather than learn features useful for action recognition, resulting in overfitting.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an Unsupervised Spatial-Temporal Feature Enrichment and Fidelity Preservation (U-FEFP) framework to generate rich distributed spatial-temporal features containing all information of the original skeleton sequence.

- A spatial-temporal feature transformation subnetwork is developed using ST-GCN and GConv-GRU to capture skeleton features effectively while reducing overfitting. 

- Unsupervised Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) based learning generates rich distributed features by pulling augmented skeleton views together.

- Unsupervised pretext task based learning using reversed prediction preserves the fidelity of original skeleton information.

- The two components work together to produce robust and discriminative representations for action recognition.

Main Contributions:
- First to analyze the overfitting mechanism in unsupervised skeleton-based action recognition and identify the need to generate rich distributed features containing full skeleton information.

- Development of U-FEFP framework with BYOL-based feature enrichment and pretext task-based fidelity preservation to achieve the desired representations.

- Design of a compact spatial-temporal feature transformation subnetwork using ST-GCN and GConv-GRU to reduce overfitting.

- State-of-the-art results on NTU-60, NTU-120 and PKU-MMD datasets, outperforming existing unsupervised methods. Ablation studies validate the design choices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Unsupervised Spatial-Temporal Feature Enrichment and Fidelity Preservation framework (U-FEFP) that generates rich distributed skeleton features containing all information of the original skeleton sequence to address the overfitting problem in unsupervised skeleton-based action recognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It investigates the mechanism behind the severe overfitting problem in unsupervised learning for skeleton based action recognition. It finds that features representing each skeleton may not be aligned with the features for action recognition, leading to the requirement of learning rich distributed features. 

2. It develops an unsupervised spatial-temporal feature enrichment and fidelity preservation framework (U-FEFP) to learn rich distributed features while preserving the fidelity of the original skeleton sequence.

3. It develops a spatial-temporal feature transformation subnetwork by combining spatial-temporal graph convolution network (ST-GCN) and graph convolutional GRU network (GConv-GRU) to effectively learn spatial-temporal features.

4. It conducts exhaustive experiments on multiple datasets which verify the effectiveness of the representations learned by U-FEFP. The method achieves state-of-the-art results under both unsupervised and semi-supervised training.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the U-FEFP framework to address the overfitting problem in unsupervised skeleton based action recognition by learning rich yet fidelity-preserved features with a specially designed network. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods.
