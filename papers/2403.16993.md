## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Comp4D: LLM-Guided Compositional 4D Scene Generation":

Problem:
Existing works on text-to-4D generation focus on creating 4D representations of individual objects rather than full scenes due to the lack of comprehensive scene-level 3D datasets. This limits their capability to generate complex interactions between multiple 4D objects. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Comp4D, a novel framework to generate compositional 4D scenes from text descriptions. It decomposes the 4D scene generation task into:
1) Constructing individual static 3D objects using 3D-aware diffusion models.
2) Designing trajectories for each object using an Large Language Model (LLM) based on the scene text prompt. 
3) Optimizing a deformable 4D representation for each object composed of 3D Gaussians. The optimization is guided by the predefined trajectories to learn realistic local deformations and global displacements.  

The key ideas are:
- Disentangle global displacement and local deformation of objects. Use LLM to design trajectories for global displacement.
- Flexible single or multi-object rendering during optimization to handle occlusions. 
- Compositional scene representation using separate deformable 3D Gaussian sets per object.

Main Contributions:
1) First framework to achieve compositional text-to-4D scene generation by modeling individual 4D objects and their interactions.
2) Novel strategy to decompose object motion into LLM-based trajectory design and optimization-based local deformation. Reduces workload for 4D optimization. 
3) Composable 4D scene representation with selective single/multi-object rendering capability. Enables stable optimization.
4) Demonstrates superior performance over baselines in terms of visual quality, motion realism and object interactions in generated 4D scenes.
