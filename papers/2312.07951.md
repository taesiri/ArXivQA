# [Semantic-aware Data Augmentation for Text-to-image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07951)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for improving text-to-image synthesis models. SADA consists of two main components: Implicit Textual Semantic Preserving Augmentation (ITA) and Generated Image Semantic Conservation (GisC). ITA augments text in the semantic space to alleviate semantic mismatch between texts and images while preserving semantics. The authors prove ITA enhances text-image consistency. GisC uses a proposed Image Semantic Regularization Loss to constrain semantics of generated images. This is shown both theoretically and empirically to prevent semantic collapse and improve image quality. Extensive experiments on various text-to-image frameworks demonstrate SADA's ability to enhance consistency and quality. Notably, SADA improves state-of-the-art diffusion models. The authors also compare to other augmentations, analyzing tradeoffs. Overall, SADA offers an effective semantics-aware augmentation solution for text-to-image synthesis.
