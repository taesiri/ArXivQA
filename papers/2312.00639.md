# [EvE: Exploiting Generative Priors for Radiance Field Enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00639)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces EvE, a novel method that enriches neural scene representations by leveraging external knowledge from pre-trained generative models. Specifically, EvE incorporates the prior learned by Stable Diffusion into a K-Planes scene representation through an alternating training procedure. This involves iteratively switching between optimizing the K-Planes on real images to ensure geometric consistency (scene fitting), and fine-tuning Stable Diffusion on the latest K-Planes to imagine new details (scene enriching). By combining the strengths of both data-driven 3D representations and large-scale 2D models, EvE is able to synthesize higher quality renderings, especially for less common views where image data is scarce. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and challenging real-world landmark datasets, outperforming prior in-the-wild neural rendering techniques. The results demonstrate that coupling neural 3D representations with 2D priors can overcome the closed-world limitations of existing scene optimization frameworks. Key strengths of EvE are its modularity for incorporating different generative models, superior detail synthesis, and state-of-the-art view interpolation performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

EvE is a method that enriches implicit 3D scene representations by alternately optimizing them on available images and then fine-tuning a pre-trained generative model to propose improved representations that are then corrected, leveraging both geometric consistency and prior knowledge for better detail and robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing EvE, a method that enriches scene representations by leveraging generative priors. Specifically:

- EvE is the first method to leverage generative priors from pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion to improve in-the-wild scene modeling. It incorporates these priors through an alternating training procedure between fitting the scene representation to images and enriching it using the generative model.

- This allows EvE to enrich scene representations like K-Planes with finer details and information that may be under-represented in the training image collection alone.

- Experiments show EvE enhances rendered scenes and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on novel view synthesis in-the-wild. The generative prior improves results even when the training set is constrained.

- The method is modular, allowing the generative model to be interchanged, and shows the value of large pre-trained vision models like Stable Diffusion for geometric 3D tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is using generative priors to enrich scene representations to achieve state-of-the-art in-the-wild scene modeling and novel view synthesis. The key innovation is the alternating training procedure guiding optimization with the prior.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an alternating training procedure between scene fitting and scene enriching. What is the intuition behind switching between these two phases? Why not combine them into a single end-to-end training procedure?

2. Scene enriching uses a pre-trained generative model (Stable Diffusion) to propose an enriched scene representation. Why was Stable Diffusion chosen over other generative models like DALL-E or Imagen? What properties make it well-suited for this task?

3. The method uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the frozen pre-trained model rather than full fine-tuning. What are the motivations behind using LoRA? What are its advantages over other parameter-efficient tuning methods?

4. How exactly does the alternating training procedure enable incorporating details from the generative prior into the optimized scene representation? What is the role of the bias-less convolutional layer in preventing full convergence during scene enriching?

5. Could the method be extended to incorporate other forms of priors beyond pre-trained generative models, such as architectural or geometric priors? How would this be implemented?

6. The paper shows improved performance in novel view synthesis under restricted training data. Why does the method exhibit more robustness compared to simply optimizing the scene representation on the available images? 

7. What challenges need to be addressed to scale up the method to larger and more complex scenes? Would techniques like hierarchical scene representations be compatible with the alternating training procedure?

8. Could the optimization guidance concept be applied in other domains like audio or graphics? What modifications would need to be made to the procedure?

9. The method currently operates by explicitly generating plane-based scene representations. Could it be adapted to other representations like neural radiance fields? Would volumetric generation be more challenging?

10. How does the alternating training procedure affect optimization challenges like mode collapse or representation degradation compared to end-to-end approaches? Does it make the training more stable?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most recent neural rendering and novel view synthesis (NVS) methods operate in a closed-world setting, where knowledge is limited to the images in the training set. However, humans rely on both visual observations (cognition) as well as intuition from prior experience when imagining novel views. This paper aims to incorporate both of these aspects.

Method: 
The authors propose EvE, a method to enrich implicit 3D scene representations by leveraging external generative priors. Specifically, EvE enriches K-Planes scene representations by incorporating knowledge from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. 

The method involves an alternating training procedure with two stages:

1) Scene Fitting: Optimize the K-Planes representation on the available images to fit the scene. Enforce geometric constraints.

2) Scene Enriching: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on the fitted K-Planes to propose an enriched version. Use Low-Rank Adaptation to efficiently adapt the pre-trained model.

These two stages are alternated - the proposed enriched version is corrected in the next cycle of scene fitting. This allows combining the geometric consistency of the K-Planes with the rich details from the prior.

Contributions:

- First technique to leverage generative priors for in-the-wild neural scene modeling and view synthesis

- Introduces an alternating training procedure for optimizing guidance using the prior

- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods for novel view synthesis on both synthetic and challenging real-world scenes

- Modular approach allowing easy incorporation of different generative models

The method proves the value of large pre-trained generative models for providing useful priors for 3D vision tasks. It takes a step towards reducing the closed-world limitations of current approaches.
