# [EvE: Exploiting Generative Priors for Radiance Field Enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most recent neural rendering and novel view synthesis (NVS) methods operate in a closed-world setting, where knowledge is limited to the images in the training set. However, humans rely on both visual observations (cognition) as well as intuition from prior experience when imagining novel views. This paper aims to incorporate both of these aspects.

Method: 
The authors propose EvE, a method to enrich implicit 3D scene representations by leveraging external generative priors. Specifically, EvE enriches K-Planes scene representations by incorporating knowledge from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. 

The method involves an alternating training procedure with two stages:

1) Scene Fitting: Optimize the K-Planes representation on the available images to fit the scene. Enforce geometric constraints.

2) Scene Enriching: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on the fitted K-Planes to propose an enriched version. Use Low-Rank Adaptation to efficiently adapt the pre-trained model.

These two stages are alternated - the proposed enriched version is corrected in the next cycle of scene fitting. This allows combining the geometric consistency of the K-Planes with the rich details from the prior.

Contributions:

- First technique to leverage generative priors for in-the-wild neural scene modeling and view synthesis

- Introduces an alternating training procedure for optimizing guidance using the prior

- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods for novel view synthesis on both synthetic and challenging real-world scenes

- Modular approach allowing easy incorporation of different generative models

The method proves the value of large pre-trained generative models for providing useful priors for 3D vision tasks. It takes a step towards reducing the closed-world limitations of current approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

EvE is a method that enriches neural scene representations by leveraging a pre-trained generative prior through an alternating training procedure of fitting the scene based on images and then further enhancing it using the prior.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing EvE, a method that enriches scene representations by leveraging generative priors. Specifically:

- EvE is the first method to leverage generative priors for in-the-wild scene modeling. It incorporates a pre-trained generative model (Stable Diffusion) to enrich a K-Planes scene representation through an alternating training procedure.

- This allows combining the benefits of geometrically consistent neural scene representations that are optimized on available images, with the rich details and prior information captured by large-scale generative models. 

- Extensive experiments show EvE enhances details and outperforms prior work on novel view synthesis, especially in less frequently captured areas of scenes. It also shows more robustness in constrained data settings.

- The method is modular and could incorporate future advances in generative models. Overall, EvE demonstrates the value of using foundation models as priors to augment neural 3D scene modeling.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an alternating training procedure between scene fitting and scene enriching. What is the intuition behind switching between these two stages instead of jointly optimizing them? What are the limitations of optimizing them jointly?

2. How does the use of a pre-trained generative model as a prior in scene enriching help enrich details compared to simply relying on the images in the training set during scene fitting? What specific advantages does it provide? 

3. The method uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the generative model instead of full fine-tuning. Why is LoRA more suitable in this context compared to full fine-tuning? What are its specific benefits?

4. During scene enriching, the generative model proposes an enriched scene representation which is then corrected in the scene fitting stage. Why is this propose-then-correct approach helpful compared to directly generating the final representation in one go?

5. Could the alternating training approach be extended to more than 2 stages? What would be the benefits and challenges associated with that?

6. How does the performance of the method vary with the number of optimization steps in each stage? Is there an optimal balance that could be determined experimentally? 

7. The resolution of the generated K-Planes representation is fixed in this work. How would a variable-resolution approach affect the enriching capability and training efficiency?

8. What modifications would be needed to apply this method to video datasets instead of static images? What new challenges might arise?

9. The method currently relies on a specific generative model (Stable Diffusion). How easy or difficult would it be to replace it with an alternate model? Would all components need to change?

10. A limitation mentioned is long training time. What specific aspects of the training pipeline could be optimized to improve efficiency without compromising enriching capability?
