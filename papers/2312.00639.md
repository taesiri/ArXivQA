# [EvE: Exploiting Generative Priors for Radiance Field Enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00639)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces EvE, a novel method that enriches neural scene representations by leveraging external knowledge from pre-trained generative models. Specifically, EvE incorporates the prior learned by Stable Diffusion into a K-Planes scene representation through an alternating training procedure. This involves iteratively switching between optimizing the K-Planes on real images to ensure geometric consistency (scene fitting), and fine-tuning Stable Diffusion on the latest K-Planes to imagine new details (scene enriching). By combining the strengths of both data-driven 3D representations and large-scale 2D models, EvE is able to synthesize higher quality renderings, especially for less common views where image data is scarce. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and challenging real-world landmark datasets, outperforming prior in-the-wild neural rendering techniques. The results demonstrate that coupling neural 3D representations with 2D priors can overcome the closed-world limitations of existing scene optimization frameworks. Key strengths of EvE are its modularity for incorporating different generative models, superior detail synthesis, and state-of-the-art view interpolation performance.
