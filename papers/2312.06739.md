## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SmartEdit: Exploring Complex Instruction-based Image Editing with Multimodal Large Language Models":

Problem:
Existing instruction-based image editing methods like InstructPix2Pix often fail to produce satisfactory results when instructions require complex reasoning or understanding. They rely on a simple CLIP text encoder which struggles to comprehend instructions and integrate image context. The paper identifies two types of complex scenarios:

1) Instructions that require understanding multiple objects in an image and editing specific attributes of one object like location, size, color etc.

2) Instructions that require reasoning using world knowledge to identify which object to edit. 

For example, the instruction could be "remove the object used to cut fruits" which requires identifying a knife in the image.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SmartEdit which incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) like LLaVA to enhance instruction understanding and reasoning. It aligns the MLLM with the CLIP text encoder using a trainable QFormer module. 

To further improve reasoning in complex scenarios, a Bidirectional Interaction Module (BIM) is introduced. BIM facilitates comprehensive interaction between image features from a visual encoder and text features from the MLLM using self-attention and cross-attention blocks.

The training methodology is also adapted to boost perception and reasoning abilities. Additional perception datasets like segmentation are utilized to improve perceptual capabilities. A small set of complex instruction-image pairs are synthesized to stimulate reasoning capacity.

Main Contributions:

1) Identifies limitations of current methods in complex instruction-based image editing scenarios involving reasoning and complex object understanding.

2) Incorporates MLLM through QFormer alignment and proposes BIM module for robust bidirectional text-image interaction.

3) Explores efficient training methodology using perception and synthesized data.

4) Introduces new benchmark Reason-Edit to evaluate complex reasoning and understanding capabilities.

Both quantitative and qualitative results on Reason-Edit demonstrate SmartEdit's superior performance over previous methods, significantly advancing the application of instruction-based editing.
