# [Many-to-many Image Generation with Auto-regressive Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03109)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing image generation models are limited in handling multi-image scenarios and arbitrarily interrelated images. However, the ability to generate multiple interconnected images is crucial for many applications like generating visually coherent advertisements, showing objects from multiple views, creating visual narratives, etc. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a framework called Many-to-Many Image Generation with Auto-regressive Diffusion Models (M2M) for generating multiple interrelated images. The key contributions are:

1) Introduction of a large-scale synthetic dataset called MIS containing 12M samples, where each sample has 25 images generated from the same text caption but different noise vectors. This creates semantic connections between the images. 

2) Proposal of the M2M model which leverages diffusion models to sequentially generate multiple images in an auto-regressive manner. It captures relationships between images using a novel Image-Set Attention module. Two variants are explored - M2M-Self which directly encodes context images, and M2M-DINO which leverages DINO visual features.

3) Demonstration that M2M variants can capture and replicate styles and content from preceding images. They also exhibit zero-shot generalization to real images despite being trained only on synthetic data.

4) Showcasing the adaptability of M2M for specialized tasks like novel view synthesis and visual procedure generation through task-specific fine-tuning. This highlights the versatility of the framework.

In summary, this paper presents a pioneering exploration into the general domain multi-image generation task through a large-scale conditional diffusion model. The model and framework offer flexibility and customization potential for diverse multi-image generation applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a large-scale synthetic multi-image dataset and an autoregressive diffusion model framework that can perceive and generate an arbitrary number of interrelated images in a flexible and adaptable manner, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization and customizability to diverse multi-image generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(1) Introduction of \dataname{}, a large-scale multi-image dataset containing 12M synthetic multi-image set samples, each with 25 interconnected images. 

(2) Proposal of a domain-general \longmodelname{} (\shortmodelname{}) model that can perceive and generate an arbitrary number of interrelated images in an auto-regressive manner.

(3) Demonstration that \shortmodelname{} learns to capture style and content from preceding images and generate novel images following the captured patterns. It exhibits great zero-shot generalization to real images and offers notable potential for customization to specific multi-image generation tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of an innovative multi-image generation framework and model that leverages a novel synthetic dataset to demonstrate impressive capability in capturing and replicating patterns from preceding images as well as adaptability to various downstream multi-image generation tasks.
