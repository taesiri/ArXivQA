# [REC-MV: REconstructing 3D Dynamic Cloth from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14236)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to reconstruct high-quality, temporally consistent 3D garment surfaces with open boundaries from monocular videos?The key points are:- Reconstructing 3D garment surfaces from monocular videos is challenging but practically important, as it provides a low-cost solution for garment digitization compared to multi-view setups. - Existing methods either reconstruct the entire clothed human (cannot separate garments) or garments from single images (cannot handle videos well). - The paper proposes to jointly optimize explicit 3D feature curves and implicit garment surfaces over time from monocular videos, then extract open garment meshes via template registration.- The core technical contributions are the intersection-free curve deformation, surface-aware curve visibility estimation, and progressive curve-surface evolution methods proposed to enable joint optimization of curves and surfaces.So in summary, the main research question is how to reconstruct high-quality 3D dynamic garments with open boundaries from monocular video inputs, which existing methods cannot handle well. The paper proposes a new formulation and method to address this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new method called REC-MV to reconstruct dynamic 3D garment meshes with open boundaries from monocular videos. This is the first work to address this challenging problem. 2. It represents the garments using both explicit feature curves and implicit signed distance fields (SDFs), and jointly optimizes them from 2D supervision. The optimization is done in a progressive co-evolution manner.3. It introduces several technical novelty to make the joint optimization possible, including intersection-free curve deformation, surface-aware curve visibility estimation, and progressive curve and surface evolution.4. It demonstrates experimentally that the proposed method outperforms existing single-image based garment reconstruction approaches on both synthetic and real-world videos. The results show that it can produce temporally coherent garment surfaces on challenging scenarios like dresses.In summary, the key novelty is the joint optimization framework for explicit curves and implicit surfaces to enable dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular videos. The experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
