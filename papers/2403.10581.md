## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Heart failure (HF) is a major public health issue with rising mortality rates globally. Early diagnosis and prevention of HF is critical to reduce its impact. However, diagnosis often occurs late when patients already have serious symptoms. A promising strategy is developing risk prediction models using low-cost 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) which can evaluate cardiovascular health and uncover HF risk. But prior works rely on limited ECG biomarkers and simple linear models which may fail to capture complex ECG nuances for early risk prediction.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents a novel ECG dual attention network (ECG-DAN) for ECG-based HF risk prediction. The lightweight network features:
1) A cross-lead attention module to capture interactions between different ECG leads 
2) Twelve lead-specific temporal attention modules to extract crucial temporal patterns within each lead

To prevent overfitting from limited training data, a two-stage training scheme is used:
1) Pretrain the network on a large public ECG-Report dataset using a language model to extract text embeddings from reports. This aligns ECG and text features to transfer clinical knowledge.
2) Finetune the network for HF risk prediction on two UK Biobank cohorts - patients with hypertension and myocardial infarction.

Main Contributions:
1) A new interpretable network architecture with dual attention for reliable and transparent HF risk predictions from ECG. 
2) A large language model-informed pretraining strategy to overcome limited training data. Clinical knowledge is transferred by aligning ECG and text report features using a public dataset covering diverse conditions.
3) State-of-the-art performance on two UK Biobank cohorts, outperforming standard ECG parameter-based and deep learning models. Analysis shows dual attention identifies clinically relevant patterns and relationships between different ECG leads over time.

In summary, the paper presents an effective framework to model intricate ECG data for early HF risk assessment across populations. The approach enhances model transparency, data efficiency and accuracy to improve prevention and management of this complex cardiovascular disease.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel ECG dual attention network with large language model-informed pretraining for interpretable and accurate heart failure risk prediction using 12-lead electrocardiograms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two main contributions:

1. It presents a novel deep neural network architecture called the ECG dual attention network (ECG-DAN) for ECG-based heart failure risk prediction. This network has a dual attention mechanism with both cross-lead and temporal attention blocks to capture interactions between leads and local temporal dynamics within each lead. This enhances interpretability by allowing visualization of lead-wise attention maps and temporal activation.

2. It proposes an effective model pretraining strategy using a large language model (LLM) and a public ECG-Report dataset. The LLM extracts clinical knowledge from text reports to guide representation learning of ECG features. This LLM-informed pretraining improves data efficiency and effectiveness for downstream risk prediction compared to pretraining on reconstruction or classification alone.

In summary, the main contributions are a new interpretable dual attention network architecture and an LLM-based pretraining approach to improve performance and data efficiency for ECG-based heart failure risk prediction. The method shows state-of-the-art performance on two UK Biobank cohorts.
