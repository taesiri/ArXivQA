# [MIP: CLIP-based Image Reconstruction from PEFT Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models are widely used in federated learning (FL) settings. CLIP models typically use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) where only a small subset of parameters are updated during training.
- Existing deep leakage from gradients (DLG) attack methods cannot directly attack CLIP-based FL systems. It is an open question whether CLIP-based FL systems are vulnerable to such reconstruction attacks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proves theoretically that the gradients from fine-tuned parameters in CLIP-based FL can still be used to reconstruct training images.
- They propose Multm-In-Parvo (MIP), the first image reconstruction attack method tailored for CLIP-based FL systems. MIP includes:
   - A label prediction strategy to predict training image labels from gradients. This simplifies the reconstruction attack objective.
   - An inverse gradient estimation method to avoid vanishing gradients in the CLIP text encoder.
   - Strategies to deal with vanishing gradients in the image encoder based on encoder complexity.

Main Contributions:
- First work to demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing private training images from gradients of fine-tuned parameters in CLIP-based FL systems.
- Proposal of MIP - the first tailored image reconstruction attack for CLIP-based FL systems. MIP is designed to handle challenges like vanishing gradients in CLIP models.
- Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Caltech 101 datasets to demonstrate that MIP can effectively reconstruct training images from gradients.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions around the privacy vulnerabilities of CLIP-based FL systems. It proposes MIP to launch reconstruction attacks on such systems and demonstrates its efficacy through analysis and experiments.
