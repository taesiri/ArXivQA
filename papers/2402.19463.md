# [SeMoLi: What Moves Together Belongs Together](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- 3D object detection typically requires manually labeling data which is expensive and does not scale well to rare classes. Prior works used bottom-up segmentation and tracking to generate pseudo-labels to train detectors in a semi-supervised manner, but these methods are not data-driven.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a data-driven approach called SeMoLi (Segment Moving in Lidar) to generate pseudo-labels for 3D object detection. 
- It learns to segment moving objects in Lidar point clouds by constructing a graph over the points and utilizing a Message Passing Network (MPN) to cluster points based on spatial proximity and motion patterns ("what moves together, belongs together").
- The trained SeMoLi model is applied to unlabeled Lidar streams to obtain per-point segments. Bounding boxes are extracted from segments and inflated to match amodal ground truth boxes.
- These pseudo-labels are used to train an off-the-shelf 3D object detector (PointPillars) in a semi-supervised manner.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a data-driven, motion-based segmentation approach for pseudo-labeling moving objects in Lidar using an MPN.
- Shows the pseudo-labeling performance improves with more training data while remaining class-agnostic and generalizable.
- Outperforms prior arts in pseudo-label quality and detector performance when trained on the pseudo-labels.
- Achieves 57.5 AP on moving objects on Waymo dataset without any real labels, compared to 40.4 AP by prior art.
- Demonstrates generalization across datasets without retraining the pseudo-labeling model.
- Releases code, models and experimental data to reproduce results and enable future research.

In summary, the paper presents a data-driven framework for pseudo-labeling objects in Lidar by learning to exploit motion cues, enabling training of 3D detectors without manual labels. The high quality and generalizability of the pseudo-labels are the main strengths.
