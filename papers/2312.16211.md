# [An Explainable AI Approach to Large Language Model Assisted Causal Model   Auditing and Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Causal networks inferred algorithmically from observational data often contain errors in the orientation of edges between variables. These errors propagate and lead to incorrect causal conclusions. Typically, auditing and correcting these models requires scarce domain expertise. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose using large language models like ChatGPT as a "Causal Auditor" to provide insights for auditing and refining causal models. Their key ideas are:

1) Ask ChatGPT the same causal question in multiple ways to get commentary from different angles. This reveals conflicts and gives broader context.

2) Specifically prompt ChatGPT to identify mediators and confounders for each causal relationship. New variables discovered can inform data collection and model refinement.

3) Visualize ChatGPT's textual responses to summarize the commentary, including:
- Causal Debate Chart: Contrasts numerical ratings on causal direction/strength. Checks consistency.  
- Causal Relation Environment Chart: Diagrams a causal relation with surrounding mediators and confounders.
- Confounder/Mediator Chart: Comprehensive summary relating all variable combinations.

The human analyst directs the prompting and interprets the visualizations to refine the model.

Main Contributions:
- Novel idea to use ChatGPT's knowledge to audit causal models
- Carefully designed prompting strategy to get meaningful commentary 
- Custom visualizations that summarize ChatGPT's textual insights for the analyst
- Demonstrated refined model with improved quality metrics

The method facilitates iterative human-AI collaboration to build better causal models with increased transparency and trust.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using large language models like ChatGPT to audit and refine causal models by querying the relationships between variables from multiple angles and visualizing the responses to expose insights for a human analyst.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of large language models such as ChatGPT to audit and refine causal networks. Specifically, the paper:

1) Develops a methodology to query ChatGPT about direct causal relationships between variables in a network, as well as potential mediators and confounders. This involves crafting prompt templates to ask about causality from multiple angles.

2) Presents several visualizations, including a Causal Debate Chart, Causal Relation Environment Chart, and Confounder/Mediator Chart, to help summarize and communicate the textual information provided by ChatGPT to human analysts. These aim to provide an explainable interface to the ChatGPT-generated insights.

3) Demonstrates the approach on real-world dataset examples, using ChatGPT responses to refine an initial causal network discovered algorithmically. This showcases the potential to iterate between automated causal discovery, ChatGPT-based auditing, and human-directed model refinement.

In summary, the key innovation is utilizing ChatGPT's causal knowledge extraction capabilities paired with explanatory visualizations to augment the causal modeling process, with humans and the AI assistant working synergistically.

The paper proposes using ChatGPT and other large language models to audit and refine causal network models, with a focus on developing visualizations to help explain the information provided by ChatGPT to human analysts. Key aspects include developing prompting strategies to elicit causal knowledge from ChatGPT, extracting and visualizing this knowledge using charts that summarize ChatGPT's commentary on specific edges and relations, and ultimately refining the original causal model based on the insights gained. The overall goal is to leverage LLMs to make the process of developing accurate causal models more efficient while also enhancing explainability and trust.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using ChatGPT prompts to gather additional causal insights and context about the relationships in an initial causal model. What are some potential limitations or risks of relying too heavily on ChatGPT's responses? How can the analysts mitigate these risks?

2. The paper visualizes the textual responses from ChatGPT to summarize the causal insights. What additional visual encodings could make key information like edge strengths, confounders, and mediators more salient? 

3. The Causal Debate Chart creatively captures the "debate" on causal directionality from the multiple ChatGPT prompts. Are there other aspects of the textual responses that could be captured visually to further this debate analogy?

4. To what extent can the analysts trust ChatGPT's assessment of edge strengths or causal ratings from 1-4? Should the visuals encode uncertainty for these ratings based on the coherency of its responses?  

5. How might the visible data sources provided to ChatGPT impact the knowledge and explanations extracted? Should data provenance be captured visually? Are there ways to assess if key variables are missing from the provided datasets?

6. The evolved causal model only incorporates high-level confounding concepts like poverty so far. What are some ways the specific confounders and mediators identified by ChatGPT could be visually encoded in the causal model view?

7. Could additional prompts be designed for ChatGPT to assess conditional independence between variables in the model? Would this provide another method to validate the model structure?

8. The paper focuses on auditing an existing initial model, but are there opportunities for ChatGPT to propose new model structures rather than just refine edges? What kind of creative prompts could make this possible? 

9. How amenable is the methodology to causal models that evolve over time rather than static snapshots? Could ChatGPT provide insights into temporal changes and lagged relationships?  

10. The paper acknowledges more work is needed on layouts and reducing visual clutter. What metaphors might capture the rich contextual relationships in an intuitive network layout? Are there opportunities for interactive filtering?
