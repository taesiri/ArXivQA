# [An Explainable AI Approach to Large Language Model Assisted Causal Model   Auditing and Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Causal networks inferred algorithmically from observational data often contain errors in the orientation of edges between variables. These errors propagate and lead to incorrect causal conclusions. Typically, auditing and correcting these models requires scarce domain expertise. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose using large language models like ChatGPT as a "Causal Auditor" to provide insights for auditing and refining causal models. Their key ideas are:

1) Ask ChatGPT the same causal question in multiple ways to get commentary from different angles. This reveals conflicts and gives broader context.

2) Specifically prompt ChatGPT to identify mediators and confounders for each causal relationship. New variables discovered can inform data collection and model refinement.

3) Visualize ChatGPT's textual responses to summarize the commentary, including:
- Causal Debate Chart: Contrasts numerical ratings on causal direction/strength. Checks consistency.  
- Causal Relation Environment Chart: Diagrams a causal relation with surrounding mediators and confounders.
- Confounder/Mediator Chart: Comprehensive summary relating all variable combinations.

The human analyst directs the prompting and interprets the visualizations to refine the model.

Main Contributions:
- Novel idea to use ChatGPT's knowledge to audit causal models
- Carefully designed prompting strategy to get meaningful commentary 
- Custom visualizations that summarize ChatGPT's textual insights for the analyst
- Demonstrated refined model with improved quality metrics

The method facilitates iterative human-AI collaboration to build better causal models with increased transparency and trust.
