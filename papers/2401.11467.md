# [Over-Reasoning and Redundant Calculation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can solve problems step-by-step using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which boosts their performance. However, it is unclear if LLMs know when to use CoT reasoning and whether the CoT steps are always necessary to answer a question.  
- This paper investigates whether LLMs tend to generate redundant and unnecessary calculations and reasoning even when they are not needed to answer a question accurately.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct a math question answering dataset called GSM8K-Zero, where the questions can be answered without any calculations since the answers are directly stated in the questions. 
- Using GSM8K-Zero, the authors define redundancy in LLM outputs as any superfluous information not required to accurately answer the question. The presence of math operators is used to identify redundant calculations.
- Several LLMs are evaluated on GSM8K-Zero to test their tendency to generate redundant outputs.

Key Findings:
- LLMs, including Claude-2 and Llama-2 models, generate lengthy and unnecessary calculations for a large fraction of questions in GSM8K-Zero, even without being explicitly prompted to show step-by-step reasoning.
- Redundant reasoning steps often lead to wrong answers, due to calculation errors or incorrect assumptions.
- Analysis using GPT-4 and ChatGPT shows these models have a strong preference for verbose, lengthy outputs compared to concise answers, even if the verbose outputs are inaccurate. This likely causes the redundant LLM behaviors.

Main Contributions:
- First study analyzing the redundancy of LLM outputs
- Construction and release of GSM8K-Zero to illustrate LLMs' tendency for unnecessary reasoning  
- Demonstration that LLMs produce excessive calculations on questions solvable without them
- Evidence that preference for lengthy outputs, regardless of correctness, causes redundant LLM reasoning


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper shows that large language models tend to generate redundant and unnecessary calculations and reasoning when answering simple math questions that do not require complex problem solving.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. To the best of the authors' knowledge, they are the first to study the redundancy of LLM outputs. 

2. They construct and release a dataset, GSM8K-Zero, which reveals the LLMs' tendency to generate redundant reasonings.

3. They show that LLMs tend to generate redundant calculations on math questions that can be answered without any calculation. 

4. They show that LLMs' tendency to generate long answers may stem from the imperfect reward model that prefers longer answers regardless of their correctness.

Through this paper, the authors hope future researchers can focus more on the redundancy of the outputs of LLMs and develop training techniques to teach LLMs when to think step-by-step.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Redundancy - The paper studies the redundancy in the outputs of large language models (LLMs) when answering questions. A key goal is understanding if LLMs generate unnecessary or redundant reasoning and calculations.

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning - The paper examines if LLMs know when CoT reasoning, or step-by-step reasoning, is needed to answer a question versus when a direct answer can be provided. 

- GSM8K-Zero - This is the dataset constructed by the authors to evaluate redundant reasoning by LLMs. It is derived from the GSM8K math QA dataset.

- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - The LLMs studied are trained using RLHF. The paper hypothesizes that the reward models in RLHF may bias LLMs to favor lengthy, redundant outputs.

- Accuracy and redundancy - Two key metrics used to evaluate LLMs on the GSM8K-Zero dataset. Redundancy refers to any unnecessary information in the LLM's response not needed to accurately answer the question.

So in summary, the key terms cover redundancy, chain-of-thought reasoning, the constructed GSM8K-Zero dataset, RLHF training, and the accuracy/redundancy metrics used for evaluation. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How exactly was the GSM8K-Zero dataset constructed from the original GSM8K dataset? What was the process and what tools were used? 

2. What percentage of the constructed GSM8K-Zero dataset consists of valid question-answer pairs based on the manual inspection done by the authors? How robust is this estimate?

3. What are some limitations of using regular expressions to calculate redundancy and accuracy metrics on the model outputs? Could more sophisticated NLP techniques have been used? 

4. Could the observations made in this paper regarding output redundancy generalize to other domains beyond mathematical QA? What experiments could be done to test this?

5. The paper relies on ChatGPT and GPT-4 for dataset construction and as proxy reward models. What biases could this introduce and how could they be mitigated? 

6. How exactly was the preference data collected from ChatGPT and GPT-4 as proxy reward models in Section 4? What was the prompt design process?

7. What other reward modeling techniques besides reinforcement learning from human feedback could reduce redundant output from large language models?

8. How well does the constructed GSM8K-Zero dataset control for model biases like position bias, given its reliance on certain foundation models? 

9. What steps were taken to ensure the questions generated with ChatGPT contain unambiguous grounded truths to avoid noisiness in the dataset?

10. The paper focuses on studying RLHF models - what modifications would be needed to reliably study redundancy of non-RLHF large language models?
