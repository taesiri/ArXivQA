# [Understanding the Role of Optimization in Double Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03951)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The phenomenon of double descent in machine learning models, where test error peaks and then reduces as model size increases past the interpolation threshold, has attracted much attention recently. 
- However, the peak is not always observed and depends on various factors like initialization, normalization, batch size etc. 
- No existing work unifies the effect of these disparate factors on the occurrence or absence of double descent.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper demonstrates for the first time that the effect of factors like initialization, learning rate, normalization etc on double descent is unified from an optimization perspective. 
- Specifically, double descent occurs if and only if the optimizer can find a sufficiently low-loss minimum. Factors affecting optimization make it harder to find a low loss, thereby reducing or eliminating the peak.

Key Contributions:
- Shows both theoretically and empirically that the height of the double descent peak negatively correlates with the condition number, which makes optimization harder.
- Demonstrates that factors like small learning rate, large batch size, slow optimization algorithm etc which hinder finding a low-loss minimum also reduce or eliminate the double descent peak.
- Shows that for setups not exhibiting double descent, simply training for longer to reach a lower training loss recovers the peak.
- Provides a unified optimization-based perspective to explain when and why double descent occurs or fails to occur based on how easy optimization is.
- Suggests double descent is unlikely to be a major issue in practical ML setups due to careful hyperparameter selection and inductive biases.

In summary, the key insight is that ease of optimization determines if double descent is observed, unifying the effect of disparate factors from initialization to choice of optimizer. The paper provides an intuitive yet powerful lens to understand this intriguing phenomenon.
