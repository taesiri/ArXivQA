# [How should the advent of large language models affect the practice of   science?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly being incorporated into scientific workflows. However, there are open questions about if and how LLMs should be used in science given their capabilities and limitations. The paper aims to spark a constructive discussion on this topic by presenting diverse perspectives.

Perspectives:

1) Schulz et al. argue that working with LLMs is analogous to working with human collaborators. LLMs have flaws like humans, so they should be treated as helpful but fallible research assistants. Authors retain responsibility for work quality and transparency.

2) Bender et al. caution that LLMs are overhyped. They are stochastic text generators, not encoders of meaning. Bespoke AI tools designed for specific tasks will likely outperform LLMs. Widespread LLM use threatens norms of data integrity, authorship accountability, peer review, and science education.

3) Marelli et al. take a moderate stance - LLMs can provide writing assistance but should be used transparently and responsibly. Researchers must vet LLM output, ensure proper attribution, and avoid marginalizing underrepresented groups.  

4) Botvinick & Gershman advocate that humans should determine research priorities and retain responsibility for advancing understanding. We should embrace AI's labor-saving benefits but bound its autonomy to protect science's subjective core.

Each perspective includes a response engaging with the others' arguments.

Conclusion: 
The perspectives demonstrate a range of issues and opportunities regarding LLMs in science. Protecting integrity and transparency is critical as this technology evolves. Further discussion within the academic community is warranted.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

Four diverse groups of scientists present differing perspectives on how large language models should be integrated into scientific workflows, debating issues around treating them as collaborators versus tools, the need for transparency and oversight, their potential benefits in aiding research, and concerns about maintaining integrity, accountability and human understanding as core goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is that it presents four diverse perspectives on how the advent of large language models should affect the practice of science. 

Specifically, the paper:

1) Outlines potential applications where LLMs could positively impact science, such as supporting scientific writing, data analysis, and literature review. 

2) Discusses pressing issues that come with the use of LLMs in science, including transparency, accountability, fairness, authorship, and integrity concerns.

3) Invites four groups of researchers (led by Schulz et al., Bender et al., Marelli et al., and Botvinick & Gershman) to share their perspectives on if and how LLMs should be used in science. These range from encouraging LLM adoption to warning against LLM usage in most proposed cases.

4) Includes responses from each group to the other perspectives, facilitating a constructive discussion and debate. 

5) Attempts to identify common themes among the diverse opinions, focusing on the social nature of science and the importance of protecting integrity.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a forum for airing multiple viewpoints on the timely issue of how LLMs could and should impact scientific practice, highlighting both opportunities and pressing concerns. The juxtaposition of clashing perspectives is intended to bring attention to this complex topic within the academic community.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Artificial intelligence 
- Meta-science 
- Automated science
- Scientific integrity
- Scientific standards
- Transparency
- Accountability  
- Fairness
- Bias
- Plagiarism
- Authorship
- Peer review

The paper discusses perspectives on how the increasing use of large language models in scientific workflows could impact scientific practice, both positively in terms of productivity gains and negatively in terms of issues around integrity, transparency, fairness etc. The multiple perspectives highlight considerations around the responsible and ethical use of this technology.

Key themes include protecting integrity through transparency and accountability, being mindful of bias, ensuring authorship norms are upheld, and safeguarding core human aspects of science like deciding research directions. The paper aims to bring attention to these issues and spark discussion within the academic community regarding adoption of large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper presents four different perspectives on how LLMs should impact scientific practice. How well do you think the authors captured the breadth of opinions on this issue? Are there additional important viewpoints that should have been included? 

2. The authors argue LLMs should be viewed more like collaborators than software tools. What are the key differences in how one would validate the outputs of a collaborator versus a software tool? How might this impact standards of rigor when using LLMs in research?

3. The authors mention open-source models as a solution to reproducibility issues with commercial LLMs. What challenges exist in developing open-source models that match the capabilities of commercial ones? How feasible is it for the research community to shift towards using primarily open-source LLMs?

4. The authors propose adding statements in papers about LLM contributions, similar to how other tools are currently acknowledged. What details should these statements include to maximize transparency? What challenges exist in reliably tracking LLM contributions? 

5. The authors argue LLMs do not qualify for authorship due to issues with accountability. If LLMs continue to advance, could they eventually meet authorship criteria? What safeguards would need to be in place before considering this?

6. The authors mention the risk of over-reliance on LLMs under career pressures. How prevalent do you think this issue will be? What policies could help mitigate this risk while still allowing responsible LLM use?  

7. The authors argue human scientists should retain control over determining research priorities and goals. If LLMs begin outpacing human capabilities in certain areas, would retaining this control slow scientific progress? Under what circumstances should LLMs guide research directions?

8. The authors emphasize vetting LLM-generated text for errors. What processes could make this vetting more efficient without compromising quality? How much effort do you think vetting will add for typical use cases? 

9. The authors argue LLMs lack values and metacognition unlike human collaborators. With further progress in AI safety research, could LLMs someday exhibit these human qualities? If so, would this change perspectives on working with them?

10. The authors present principles like transparency and fairness for guiding LLM use. Which other ethical principles are important to consider? How well do current LLMs align with principles like transparency and accountability?
