# [How should the advent of large language models affect the practice of   science?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly being incorporated into scientific workflows. However, there are open questions about if and how LLMs should be used in science given their capabilities and limitations. The paper aims to spark a constructive discussion on this topic by presenting diverse perspectives.

Perspectives:

1) Schulz et al. argue that working with LLMs is analogous to working with human collaborators. LLMs have flaws like humans, so they should be treated as helpful but fallible research assistants. Authors retain responsibility for work quality and transparency.

2) Bender et al. caution that LLMs are overhyped. They are stochastic text generators, not encoders of meaning. Bespoke AI tools designed for specific tasks will likely outperform LLMs. Widespread LLM use threatens norms of data integrity, authorship accountability, peer review, and science education.

3) Marelli et al. take a moderate stance - LLMs can provide writing assistance but should be used transparently and responsibly. Researchers must vet LLM output, ensure proper attribution, and avoid marginalizing underrepresented groups.  

4) Botvinick & Gershman advocate that humans should determine research priorities and retain responsibility for advancing understanding. We should embrace AI's labor-saving benefits but bound its autonomy to protect science's subjective core.

Each perspective includes a response engaging with the others' arguments.

Conclusion: 
The perspectives demonstrate a range of issues and opportunities regarding LLMs in science. Protecting integrity and transparency is critical as this technology evolves. Further discussion within the academic community is warranted.
