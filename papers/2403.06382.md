# [Pre-Trained Model Recommendation for Downstream Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06382)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Selecting the optimal pre-trained model for a new target task is important for transfer learning, but fine-tuning all candidate models is computationally expensive. 
- Existing model selection methods have limitations in terms of non-transferable scores, reliance on labels, and limited search scope over models.

Proposed Solution - Fennec Framework
- Inspired by recommendation systems, maps models and tasks into a transfer-related latent space using matrix factorization on historical performance data. Distance between vectors indicates transferability.
- Proposes archi2vec method to encode intricate model architectures into vectors reflecting inherent inductive biases. 
- Uses a large vision model (CLIP) as proxy to map new tasks into transfer space without labels. 
- Final scores computed as weighted combination of transfer scores from latent space and meta scores encoding model structures. Efficient O(1) scoring.

Main Contributions:
- Novel transfer learning framework for model selection without relying on labels or forward passes.
- Archi2vec method to automatically represent complex neural architectures.  
- Extensive benchmark with 105 models over 60 architectures, significantly expanding search scope.
- State-of-the-art performance on benchmark and public dataset with minimal computational cost. 
- Opens possibilities for unsupervised model ranking based on historical data.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient and label-free approach for pre-trained model recommendation that outperforms existing methods. The introduced benchmark and analysis of model architectures also contribute to the field.
