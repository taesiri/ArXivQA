# [Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Adversarial In-Context Learning (Adv-ICL) to optimize prompts for in-context learning with large language models (LLMs). Adv-ICL sets up a minimax game between two LLMs acting as a generator and discriminator, with the goal of fooling the discriminator into classifying the generator's outputs as real. A third LLM called the prompt modifier iteratively suggests edits to the prompts given to the generator and discriminator based on the adversarial loss. Experiments over 11 NLP tasks involving summarization, reasoning, translation, etc. show that Adv-ICL significantly boosts the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs by updating only the prompts instead of model parameters. As a computationally efficient approach requiring very limited data, Adv-ICL demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment. Core strengths highlighted are its model-agnostic architecture, ease of implementation, effectiveness in low resource scenarios, and applicability to complex reasoning prompts like chain-of-thought.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Adversarial In-Context Learning (Adv-ICL), an adversarial training framework to optimize prompts for in-context learning of large language models, keeping model parameters fixed while iteratively updating prompts in a minimax game between a generator and discriminator.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Adversarial In-Context Learning (Adv-ICL) to optimize prompts for in-context learning. Specifically:

- Adv-ICL sets up a minimax game between a generator (G) and a discriminator (D), both powered by large language models (LLMs) with fixed parameters. It optimizes the prompts to G and D in an adversarial manner to improve G's output.

- Adv-ICL uses a third LLM as a prompt modifier (M) to generate possible prompt updates based on the adversarial loss from D's classification. The updates that most improve the loss are selected.

- Experiments show Adv-ICL boosts performance over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 text generation and classification tasks.

- Adv-ICL is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and effective in low-resource settings since it uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Adv-ICL, an adversarial learning framework for optimizing prompts in in-context learning that achieves new state-of-the-art performance across a range of NLP tasks.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional adversarial learning (like in GANs) requires updating model parameters, which is impractical for large pre-trained language models due to compute and data constraints. 
- It is desirable to have methods that can improve language model performance on new tasks using limited data, without having to fine-tune the models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Adversarial In-Context Learning (Adv-ICL), which applies adversarial learning to in-context learning. 
- Adv-ICL keeps language model parameters fixed and instead updates the prompts/instructions given to the model in an adversarial manner.
- It uses one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier.
- The generator tries to generate realistic text while the discriminator tries to differentiate between real and generated text.
- Based on the adversarial loss, the prompt modifier updates the prompts to generator and discriminator.

Main Contributions:
- Adv-ICL outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques on 11 text generation, classification, reasoning and challenging language tasks.
- It is computationally efficient as it doesn't update model parameters, making it easy to extend to any LLM and task.
- It is effective in low-resource settings, achieving gains using only 20 training points over just 5 rounds.
- Implementation is easy, encouraging use in real-world applications.
- The method is supported theoretically to achieve desired equilibrium under certain assumptions.

In summary, the key innovation is using adversarial learning to optimize prompts/instructions to language models rather than model parameters. This is highly practical and extends adversarial techniques to in-context learning.
