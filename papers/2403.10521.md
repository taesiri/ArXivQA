# [P-MapNet: Far-seeing Map Generator Enhanced by both SDMap and HDMap   Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10521)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on expensive high-definition maps (HD Maps) that are cumbersome to generate and keep updated. This hinders the scalability and limits autonomous vehicles to regions with HD Map coverage. Therefore, there is a need for accurate and efficient online HD Map generation methods that can work beyond regions with HD Maps. However, existing online HD Map generators have limited performance, especially over long ranges.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes P-MapNet, an online HD Map generator that incorporates priors from both standard-definition maps (SD Maps) and HD Maps to improve performance and work over longer ranges. 

Specifically, P-MapNet extracts road centerline skeletons from weakly aligned OpenStreetMap data as the SD Map prior. It handles the misalignment using an attention mechanism to attend to the most relevant parts of the SD Map. This allows incorporating road structure information to improve HD Map generation.

Additionally, P-MapNet uses a masked autoencoder pretrained on HD Maps to encode HD Map distribution priors. This acts as a refinement module to make the generated maps looks more realistic by correcting errors and artefacts.

Main Contributions:

1. Novel architecture to incorporate weakly aligned SD Map priors into online HD Map generator using attention, leading to large performance gains

2. Innovative use of masked autoencoder to capture HD Map distribution as a refinement module, enhancing realism

3. State-of-the-art performance on public datasets, especially over long ranges. For example, 13.4% mIoU improvement at 240m x 60m range.

4. Detailed experiments and analyses revealing P-MapNet as a far-seeing solution with higher gains at longer ranges. Improved understanding of using map priors for online HD Map generation.

In summary, P-MapNet advances the state-of-the-art in online HD Map generation by effectively incorporating SD Map and HD Map priors in a novel architecture to produce more accurate and realistic maps even over very long ranges.
