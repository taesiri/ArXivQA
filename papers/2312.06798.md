## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT lack consistency, reliability, explainability and safety, which hinders trustworthiness. This is concerning for critical applications like healthcare.
- LLMs struggle with paraphrasing, adversarial inputs, and alignment with human preferences. They can produce unsafe, biased or nonsensical responses.

Proposed Solution - The CREST Framework:  
- Combines neural and symbolic AI methods into "Neurosymbolic AI" to create trustworthy LLMs.
- Has 4 main pillars - Consistency, Reliability, Explainability and Safety (CREST).
- Uses ensembles of LLMs infused with knowledge graphs and domain expertise to enhance performance. 
- Incorporates techniques like paraphrasing, adversarial training, and instruction tuning.
- Grounded in health knowledge bases and clinical practice guidelines.

Key Contributions:
- Identified limitations of LLMs regarding trustworthiness.
- Proposed the CREST framework to achieve reliable, consistent, explainable and safe LLMs.
- Demonstrated techniques to infuse knowledge into LLM ensembles.
- Showed improvements on a mental health dataset with the framework.
- Discussed methods for quantitative evaluation of the framework's objectives.
- Highlighted the potential of Neurosymbolic AI to create trustworthy AI systems.

In summary, the paper presents the CREST framework powered by Neurosymbolic AI to instill consistency, reliability, explainability and safety in LLMs, especially for sensitive applications in health and wellbeing. Both the fusion of neural and symbolic techniques along with grounding in domain knowledge are crucial for building trust between humans and AI systems.
