# [On Learning the Transformer Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08323)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research questions addressed in this paper are:1. Does kernel learning improve the performance of fixed kernel methods like LinearElu and Performer on long sequence tasks? The authors evaluate their proposed kernel learning methods on long context datasets from the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark and find that their methods outperform fixed kernel baselines like LinearElu and Performer.2. What is the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for kernel learning Transformer models? The authors benchmark the computational efficiency of their proposed models and show they achieve better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to vanilla Transformers and other efficient Transformer architectures on long sequence modeling tasks. 3. How do kernel learning Transformers compare to vanilla Transformers on short sequence tasks where Transformers already work well? The authors evaluate on GLUE benchmark tasks with short context and find the kernel learning Transformers are competitive with vanilla Transformers, with no significant degradation in performance.Overall, the core hypothesis appears to be that incorporating kernel learning into the Transformer architecture can improve performance on tasks requiring long context modeling, while retaining efficiency and competitiveness on short context tasks. The experiments are designed to validate whether kernel learning helps Transformer models effectively handle long sequences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new framework called "Kernelized Transformers" for learning the kernel function within the attention mechanism of Transformers. The main contributions are:1. The paper proposes several methods to learn the kernel function in Transformers in an end-to-end fashion, based on techniques from kernel learning literature like Random Kitchen Sinks and Positive Random Features. 2. It shows theoretically that the proposed Kernelized Transformers are Turing Complete and can control their variance.3. It evaluates the proposed models on long context tasks from the LRA benchmark and short context tasks from GLUE. The experiments demonstrate that:- Kernelized Transformers achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art efficient Transformers on long context tasks. The kernel learned models tend to outperform fixed kernel models like Linear Transformers and Performers.- On short context tasks like GLUE, the Kernelized Transformers perform on par with vanilla Transformers, showing no loss of accuracy.- The kernel learned models have linear time and memory complexity in terms of sequence length.4. The paper provides an empirical analysis of the variance and sparsity handling ability of the proposed models. It also offers recommendations on which kernel learning method works best under different settings.In summary, the main contribution is a new framework for incorporating kernel learning into Transformers to improve their accuracy and scalability, while retaining competitive performance on short context tasks as well. The paper demonstrates the benefits of learning the kernel over using fixed kernels, through comprehensive experiments and analysis.
