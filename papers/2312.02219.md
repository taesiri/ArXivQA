# [Behind the Magic, MERLIM: Multi-modal Evaluation Benchmark for Large   Image-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02219)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large vision and language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but their effectiveness on fundamental computer vision tasks is unclear. 
- There is no standardized benchmark to evaluate these models, especially in terms of visual grounding and "hallucination" events where language output cannot be grounded in the visual input.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces MERLIM - a Multi-modal Evaluation BenchmaRk for Large Image-language Models. 
- MERLIM contains over 279K image-question pairs focused on core vision tasks: object recognition, object counting, relationship understanding.
- Images are edited to remove objects and test if predictions change without visual grounding. 
- Queries are designed to be semantically similar but test language bias.

Key Contributions:
- Standardized testbed to assess zero-shot effectiveness of LVLMs on fundamental vision tasks.
- Extensive evaluation identifies/quantifies common errors: poor visual grounding, hallucination events, sensitivity to input queries.  
- Analysis shows models have weak visual groundings but can still make guesses through language biases or global visual patterns.
- Benchmark focuses on assessing cross-modal hallucinations not grounded in visual input.
- Results show state-of-the-art LVLMs still struggle with fine-grained concepts, consistency, and grounding.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel benchmark to evaluate vision-language models, with a focus on analyzing visual grounding issues and language hallucinations. The results demonstrate key limitations around consistency, grounding and fine-grained understanding in current state-of-the-art models.
