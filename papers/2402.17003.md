# [Monitoring Fidelity of Online Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in   Clinical Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17003)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper proposes an AI system called "Oralytics" that provides personalized prompts to improve oral health behaviors like toothbrushing. The key challenge is how to optimally decide when to send prompts to each user to maximize their brushing quality over a 70-day period. 

Proposed Solution - Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:
The paper presents a contextual bandit reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimize the timing and frequency of sending prompts. The algorithm models the expected reward (brushing quality) as a function of user state features like time of day, prior app usage, etc. It updates a Bayesian posterior over model parameters as it collects more user data. The RL policy samples model parameters from this posterior to estimate the expected reward of sending a prompt versus not sending, and selects the action probabilistically based on this estimated reward.

Key Contributions:
1) Novel application of RL to optimize just-in-time prompts for health behavior change. 
2) Method to construct user state features, action space, and customized reward function.
3) Using action centering in the Bayesian linear reward model to better estimate the incremental effect of an action.
4) Modification to RL sampling algorithm to enhance scientific replicability. 
5) Accounting for delayed effects of actions via a cost function to avoid prompt fatigue.

In summary, the key innovation is the design of an interpretable RL algorithm that provides scientifically sound and replicable results, while optimizing the timing and effect of just-in-time prompts to improve oral health behaviors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides supplementary details on the reinforcement learning algorithm used in the Oralytics system to optimize personalized prompting for oral health behavior change.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, this paper seems to provide details on the reinforcement learning algorithm used in the Oralytics system to optimize the timing and frequency of sending personalized prompts to improve oral health behaviors. Specifically:

- It describes the state space, action space, policy, and reward function used by the RL algorithm to learn an optimal prompting strategy over time. The state space includes features like time of day, past app usage, and past brushing behavior. The action space is binary - send a prompt or not. The policy uses a Bayesian linear regression model with posterior sampling to estimate the expected reward of sending a prompt versus not. And the reward function aims to maximize immediate brushing quality while accounting for potential reduced effectiveness of future prompts if they are sent too frequently.

- It also provides specifics on the posterior updating procedure and the use of a smooth logistic function in the action selection policy to enhance replicability and provide sufficient statistical power.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be a detailed description of a reinforcement learning approach for optimizing and personalizing just-in-time prompts to improve health behaviors, using oral hygiene as a case study. The details provided here seem intended to supplement the main ideas described in the paper this appendix is for.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The state space used for the RL algorithm includes an exponential average of brushing quality and messages sent over the past 7 days. What was the rationale behind choosing an exponential average versus a simple average? How sensitive are the results to this modeling choice?

2. In the modified state space for the fallback method, the exponential average brushing quality feature is replaced with only the most recent value. What is the justification for this, given that brushing quality likely has auto-correlative structure? How does this impact learning performance?

3. The action space is binary in terms of whether or not to send a prompt. Was any consideration given to also optimizing the content/framing of the prompt itself as part of the action space? If so, what were the challenges with this approach that led it to not be pursued?

4. The reward function consists of brushing quality minus a cost term. What was the motivation behind the specific functional form chosen for the cost term in Equation 4? Were any alternatives explored or considered? 

5. The posterior updating equation references update times τ that are on a different cadence than the decision times t. What determines the cadence of the update times and how was this choice justified?

6. Smooth posterior sampling is used rather than vanilla Thompson sampling. What benefits does the smooth logistic function provide in improving scientific reproducibility and statistical power? How was it calibrated?

7. The parameters L_min and L_max are used to clip the randomization probabilities away from 0 and 1. What analysis was done to choose suitable values for these parameters? How sensitive are the results to them?

8. The cost function parameters ξ1 and ξ2 are left unspecified. What range of values were explored for these hyperparameters? How sensitive is overall performance to them and how were optimal values selected?

9. The Q-learning algorithm used models the mean reward as a function of state and action. Was any consideration given to modeling higher moments of the reward distribution or using risk-sensitive RL algorithms?

10. The method description focuses on a single-agent RL algorithm. Would a multi-agent algorithm with modeling of peer effects have been beneficial in this application? What challenges would this entail?
