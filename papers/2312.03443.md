# [Data-driven Crop Growth Simulation on Time-varying Generated Images   using Multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03443)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a two-stage framework for data-driven crop growth simulation using generative adversarial networks (GANs). In the first stage, a conditional Wasserstein GAN (CWGAN) with conditional batch normalization is used to generate realistic time-varying crop images based on an input image and multiple influencing conditions like time, treatment information, and simulated biomass from a process-based model. This allows flexible simulations of future growth stages under varying conditions. In the second stage, plant traits like leaf area and biomass are estimated from the generated images using CNNs and compared to real images for evaluation. Experiments on three plant datasets - Arabidopsis, cauliflower and crop mixtures - demonstrate accurate short and long-term growth predictions even with simulated treatment changes. Key findings include: 1) adding more growth conditions improves prediction accuracy, 2) biomass estimation on simulated images has comparable accuracy to real images, 3) the framework can serve as an interface between process-based and image-based crop models. Overall, the conditional image generation method enables data-driven modeling of complex crop growth while overcoming limitations of pure process-based or image-based approaches alone.
