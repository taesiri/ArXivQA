# [Event-Driven Learning for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00270)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) that can leverage their sparse, event-driven properties remains challenging. Specifically, two key issues are: 1) the over-sparsity problem where some layers fail to generate spikes, blocking gradient flow, and 2) the gradient reversal problem caused by mismatches between backpropagation-based learning and the dynamics of spiking neurons.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper proposes two novel event-driven learning algorithms to address the above issues:
  1. Spike-Timing-Dependent Event-Driven (STD-ED) learning: Uses an Adaptive Firing Threshold-based Integrate-and-Fire (AFT-IF) neuron model with non-leaky IF kernels and adaptive thresholds. This addresses both over-sparsity and gradient reversal issues. Learning occurs precisely at spike times.
  2. Membrane-Potential-Dependent Event-Driven (MPD-ED) learning: Incorporates the adaptive firing threshold mechanism into spiking neurons, and uses a masked surrogate gradient function for event-driven learning based on membrane potential. This also handles over-sparsity without suffering from gradient reversal.

Main Contributions:
- Provides comprehensive analysis of issues in training SNNs, limitations of prior event-driven methods
- Proposes STD-ED and MPD-ED algorithms with analyses showing how they resolve key training challenges
- Achieves SOTA accuracy among event-driven methods, comparable to surrogate gradient methods, using less resources
- Demonstrates up to 99.14% (STD-ED) and 94.22% (MPD-ED) reductions in training complexity 
- Validates extreme efficiency with 30x less energy for hardware learning over surrogate gradient algorithm
- Shows practical applicability for low-power EMG-based gesture recognition on neuromorphic hardware

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards efficient, event-driven training algorithms for spiking neural networks, with both empirical evaluations and hardware validation indicating promising avenues for energy-efficient deep neuromorphic computing.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes two novel event-driven learning algorithms for spiking neural networks (SNNs) - the Spike-Timing-Dependent Event-Driven (STD-ED) algorithm and the Membrane-Potential-Dependent Event-Driven (MPD-ED) algorithm. These algorithms enable efficient training of SNNs by performing backpropagation only upon spike events rather than at every timestep.

2. The proposed algorithms incorporate novel neuron models (AFT-IF neuron for STD-ED and AFT-LIF neuron for MPD-ED) to address key challenges in event-driven learning such as over-sparsity and gradient reversal problems.

3. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art accuracy performance of the proposed methods, surpassing existing event-driven counterparts by up to 2.51% for STD-ED and 6.79% for MPD-ED on CIFAR-100 dataset.
