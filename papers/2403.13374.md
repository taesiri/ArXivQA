# [Byzantine-resilient Federated Learning With Adaptivity to Data   Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper deals with the problem of federated learning (FL) in the presence of malicious Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity across users. Byzantine attacks refer to situations where some participating devices send arbitrary or malicious updates to bias the learning process. Data heterogeneity refers to the case where data distributions at local devices are not identically distributed. Both Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity can degrade the performance of federated learning.

Solution:
The paper proposes a novel aggregation algorithm called Robust Average Gradient Algorithm (RAGA). The key ideas are:

1) RAGA allows each user to perform multiple local SGD updates before sending an update to the server. This reduces communication overhead.

2) For aggregating user updates, RAGA uses the geometric median which is robust to Byzantine attacks. It can tolerate up to less than 50% Byzantine users. 

3) For theoretical analysis, the paper proves that RAGA can achieve a convergence rate of O(1/T^{2/3−δ}) for non-convex loss and linear convergence for strongly convex loss, under common assumptions. The convergence holds as long as Byzantine users comprise less than 50% of total users, showing robustness.

4) As data heterogeneity across users reduces, the algorithm is shown to converge to the stationary point (for non-convex loss) or global optimum (for strongly convex loss). This demonstrates adaptivity to data heterogeneity.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposal of a new Byzantine attack resilient federated learning algorithm RAGA using geometric median based aggregation.

2) Theoretical analysis to prove convergence guarantees and robustness of RAGA for both non-convex and strongly convex losses under heterogeneous data.

3) Empirical evaluation on real datasets to demonstrate the robustness of RAGA against different levels of Byzantine attacks. Comparisons show improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in designing and analyzing Byzantine-resilient federated learning algorithms that can adapt to heterogeneous user data distributions.
