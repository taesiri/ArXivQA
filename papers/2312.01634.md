# [Robust Streaming, Sampling, and a Perspective on Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01634)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a potential high-level summary paragraph of the key ideas and contributions of the paper:

This paper explores an important connection between the emerging fields of adversarially robust streaming algorithms and online statistical learning theory. Through an in-depth survey of recent results in robust streaming, sampling, and online learning, the authors motivate a deep relationship between sample complexity bounds for robust streaming algorithms and measures of online learnability like Littlestone and Rademacher complexity. They present new theorems from Alon et al. that formally characterize online learnability using the notion of an Adversarial Uniform Law of Large Numbers â€“ a robust analogue of the Uniform Law of Large Numbers that connects adversarial $\epsilon$-approximability of streaming algorithms to finite Littlestone dimension. These theorems elegantly parallel classic PAC learning results, unifying the areas of robust streaming and online learning. The paper summarizes clever proof techniques that link adversarial sampling complexity to Sequential Rademacher Complexity. Overall, it sets the foundation for a promising new research direction unifying two previously disjoint fields, with many open questions around non-oblivious sampling algorithms and practical algorithm design guided by online learning theory.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper surveys the emerging connections between adversarial robustness in streaming algorithms and online statistical learning theory, including recent results that characterize online learnability through adversarial uniform laws of large numbers and tighten bounds on optimal regret.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is exploring and formalizing the deep connections between the fields of online statistical learning and adversarially-robust streaming. Specifically:

1) The paper surveys recent developments in adversarially-robust streaming algorithms, especially sketch switching techniques for robust streaming and analysis of robust sample sizes needed for adversarial sampling. 

2) The paper highlights intuitive relationships between adversarial robustness concepts (e.g. sample complexity bounds) and measures of online learnability (e.g. Littlestone dimension).

3) The paper presents the key results from Alon et al. that formally prove equivalences between online learnability, adversarial uniform laws of large numbers, and finite Littlestone dimension. This parallels and completes the classic PAC learning equivalences in the offline setting.

4) The paper gives an overview of how techniques like double sampling and sequential Rademacher complexity help connect adversarial sampling complexity to regret bounds in online learning.

5) The paper suggests that these formal connections open up new areas of research at the intersection of these fields, like developing new non-oblivious adversarial sampling schemes or using the connections to design more robust and practical streaming algorithms.

In summary, the main contribution is elucidating, proving, and exploring the deep and fruitful connections between adversarial streaming and online statistical learning theory. The paper helps unify the fields and points the way toward new research directions in both areas.

5. The paper highlights an symmetry between oblivious sampling/offline learning and adversarial sampling/online learning. What are some examples of this symmetry? Are there any aspects where the symmetry breaks down?

6. How does the mistake tree framework used to define Littlestone dimension encapsulate the sequential nature of online learning problems? In what ways is it similar to or different from the VC dimension?

7. The sketch switching method activates new copies of an algorithm when the estimate falls out of a certain range. What considerations factor into setting this range? How does it impact space complexity versus robustness?

8. The paper connects robustness of linear sketches to the adversarial GapNorm problem. What Makes GapNorm difficult for linear sketches? How does the adversarial strategy outlined exploit properties of linear sketches?
