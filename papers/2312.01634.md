# [Robust Streaming, Sampling, and a Perspective on Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01634)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a potential high-level summary paragraph of the key ideas and contributions of the paper:

This paper explores an important connection between the emerging fields of adversarially robust streaming algorithms and online statistical learning theory. Through an in-depth survey of recent results in robust streaming, sampling, and online learning, the authors motivate a deep relationship between sample complexity bounds for robust streaming algorithms and measures of online learnability like Littlestone and Rademacher complexity. They present new theorems from Alon et al. that formally characterize online learnability using the notion of an Adversarial Uniform Law of Large Numbers â€“ a robust analogue of the Uniform Law of Large Numbers that connects adversarial $\epsilon$-approximability of streaming algorithms to finite Littlestone dimension. These theorems elegantly parallel classic PAC learning results, unifying the areas of robust streaming and online learning. The paper summarizes clever proof techniques that link adversarial sampling complexity to Sequential Rademacher Complexity. Overall, it sets the foundation for a promising new research direction unifying two previously disjoint fields, with many open questions around non-oblivious sampling algorithms and practical algorithm design guided by online learning theory.
