## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional video data annotation processes are resource-intensive, inefficient, rely on third-party annotators lacking domain expertise, and struggle with consistent labeling of complex/subtle concepts. This leads to poor model quality, mistrust in the systems, and difficulties rapidly iterating.

Proposed Solution - Video Annotator (VA):
- An interactive framework for efficiently building video classifiers using vision-language models and active learning. Allows direct involvement of domain experts in a continuous annotation process.

Key Features: 
- Leverages zero-shot capabilities of vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) to bootstrap annotation process through text-video search.  
- Employs active learning to guide users to label diverse and informative examples.
- Lightweight classifiers enable low latency iterative training.
- Model quality and data diversity metrics guide the annotation process.  
- Enables rapid deployment and updating of models.

Main Contributions:
- Presents the VA system and demonstrates improved sample efficiency and model quality.
- Deploys VA internally at Netflix for variety of video understanding tasks.
- Releases dataset of 153k labels across 56 tasks annotated by video professionals using VA.
- Open sources code to replicate experiments showing VA achieves median 8.3 point AP gain over competitive baselines.

The paper argues involving domain experts directly using this interactive framework can enhance efficiency, usability, and effectiveness of video classifiers. VA offers a new paradigm emphasizing human-in-the-loop that is low cost, rapid to iterate, and builds user trust.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Video Annotator, a novel human-in-the-loop framework that leverages vision-language models and active learning to efficiently build video classifiers by directly involving domain experts in the annotation and model training process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors present Video Annotator (VA), a novel framework to build video classifiers efficiently using pre-trained visual-language models, active learning, and direct involvement of domain experts in the training process.

2) The authors deployed VA internally at Netflix and found applicability in a variety of business problems. Experiments demonstrate that their system enjoys improved sample efficiency, visual diversity, and model quality, with a 8.3 median point improvement in Average Precision relative to the most competitive baseline. 

3) The authors release a dataset with 153k labels across 56 video understanding tasks annotated by three professional video editors using VA, and they also release code to replicate their experiments.

In summary, the main contribution is the Video Annotator framework for efficiently building video classifiers through a human-in-the-loop approach leveraging vision-language models and active learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework and release datasets and code to enable further research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel framework called Video Annotator (VA). What are some key capabilities and components of this framework? How is it different from existing video annotation tools?

2. The paper emphasizes the importance of direct involvement of domain experts in the model building process. What are some of the key benefits of this approach compared to relying solely on data scientists and third party annotators?

3. The framework employs active learning techniques to enhance sample efficiency. How does the active learning process work in VA? What are some strategies used to select clips for annotation at each stage?

4. The paper introduces a data diversity score to quantify diversity of the labeled dataset. How is this score calculated? Why is visual diversity important for building robust classifiers?

5. What is the motivation behind having separate feeds for top scoring positives, top scoring negatives, borderline cases and random clips? How does reviewing these different sets help improve the classifiers?

6. An experiment in the paper evaluates different strategies for selecting the source of clips to annotate at each step. Can you explain the multi-armed bandit formulation used in this experiment? What were the main findings?

7. What vision-language model is used for text-to-video search and as the video encoder in VA? How does leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of this model help with search and bootstrapping the annotation process?  

8. What strategies could be used to further improve the sample efficiency and performance of models built using VA? For instance, could incorporating audio, subtitles or contextual information help?

9. The paper focuses primarily on context-free video classification tasks. What modifications would be needed to extend the framework to tasks that require understanding narrative context spanning longer videos?

10. The paper releases a dataset of 153k annotations across 56 labels collected using VA. What analyses could be performed on this dataset to further evaluate the framework? For instance, studying inter-annotator agreement.
