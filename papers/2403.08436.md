# [PFStorer: Personalized Face Restoration and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Face restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) face images from degraded observations such as blur, low resolution, noise and compression artifacts. Humans are sensitive to subtle differences in facial features which can cause a shift in perceived identity. Thus, a face restoration model needs to not only output realistic images, but also preserve identity. Recent models can generate realistic results, but often fail to preserve identity due to lacking necessary context.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a personalized face restoration approach called PFStorer. The key idea is to personalize a base restoration model using a few HQ reference images of a person's face. This provides the necessary context for the model to faithfully restore images of that person. 

The base model starts from a pre-trained general image restoration model which is then fine-tuned on a face dataset. To avoid misalignment issues, the model is trained on random crops instead of aligned faces. Personalization is achieved via trainable adapter blocks that enable adaptation while preserving priors. To prevent over-reliance on identity cues in the degraded input image, a generative regularizer loss is added which forces the model to hallucinate the identity solely from references.

A learnable parameter balances between restored features from the input and personalized features from references. This prevents changes to intermediate outputs caused by adapters. The method can also perform super-resolution by utilizing tiling.

Main Contributions:
- Novel personalized restoration approach to solve face restoration's ill-posed nature and preserve identity
- Adapter-based personalization that retains rich generative priors 
- Generative regularizer to learn robust identity representation  
- Improved training procedure with random crops for robustness
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art perceptual quality and identity preservation
