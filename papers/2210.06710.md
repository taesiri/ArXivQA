# [Large Language Models are few(1)-shot Table Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06710)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How well can large language models (LLMs) perform on table reasoning tasks with few-shot in-context learning, without any fine-tuning on table-specific data? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Despite not being pre-trained on table data, LLMs may still be competent at reasoning over tables due to encountering many tables in their web-scale pre-training.2) Using chain-of-thought prompting with just 1-2 examples, LLMs may achieve strong performance on complex table reasoning tasks, comparable to or exceeding some existing models that require full fine-tuning. 3) The reasoning chains elicited from the LLMs can provide some insight into their internal reasoning process and semantics, which may be useful for various purposes like justifying predictions or aiding annotation.So in summary, the main research question is assessing the few-shot table reasoning abilities of LLMs using chain-of-thought prompting, without any table-specific fine-tuning. The key hypotheses focus on the potential competence of LLMs at this challenging task, their ability to match or exceed fine-tuned models, and the utility of their generated reasoning chains.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is how I would compare it to other research in the field:The paper presents an interesting new approach to table reasoning using large language models and few-shot prompting. This is a relatively underexplored area compared to more traditional techniques like semantic parsing or pre-trained table representation models. The idea of utilizing LLMs for complex table reasoning with just demonstrations is novel. Most prior work has focused on developing specialized architectures and pre-training objectives for table understanding. In contrast, this work shows that even models like GPT-3 with no table pre-training can reason over tables when properly prompted. The Chain of Thoughts prompting technique allows GPT-3 to achieve strong performance on table QA and fact verification with just 1-2 examples, comparable to fine-tuned models.The simplicity of the approach is a major advantage compared to prior work requiring extensive pre-training or annotation. The elicited reasoning chains also allow some level of interpretability, unlike most black-box neural models. This demonstrates that scaling generic LLMs can induce some reasoning capabilities even absent specialized training.However, there are still many limitations compared to leading semantic parsing and table pre-training techniques. The performance is not yet state-of-the-art. The approach struggles to handle large tables and has unpredictability issues. It likely has less systematic compositional generalization. But the work provides a strong simple baseline and analysis of LLM reasoning that can inform future research.In summary, the work explores a promising new direction of utilizing generic LLMs for complex table reasoning tasks. It demonstrates surprisingly strong few-shot performance despite no table pre-training. The approach is simple and interpretable but has limitations compared to leading models. Overall, the work helps advance the understanding of reasoning capabilities in scaled LLMs applied to structured knowledge.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper investigates the ability of large language models like GPT-3 to perform complex table reasoning tasks with few-shot in-context learning, finding they can achieve strong performance on table QA and fact verification with chain-of-thought prompts, even matching some state-of-the-art models, though they struggle on very large tables.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing better methods to help LLMs maintain consistent performance across tables of different sizes. The authors found that LLM performance degraded significantly on larger tables, so new techniques are needed to address this limitation.- Combining the strengths of LLMs and symbolic methods. The authors suggest investigating ways to let symbolic models narrow the search space or provide structured knowledge, while using LLMs for more flexible reasoning over limited information. - Scaling up LLMs further or pre-training them on table-specific corpora to unlock even greater reasoning abilities. The authors found reasoning performance increased substantially with larger LLM scale.- Using LLMs to generate annotation of reasoning chains or semantic forms for other table reasoning datasets. This could greatly reduce the annotation burden and cost.- Addressing the unpredictability and randomness issues of LLM reasoning by developing better prompting techniques.- Extending the strong few-shot reasoning abilities demonstrated to other structured reasoning tasks beyond just tables.- Developing methods to enable smaller LLM models to achieve the reasoning capabilities shown by large models like GPT-3.In summary, the key future directions are developing techniques to handle larger tables, combining symbolic and neural methods, leveraging LLMs for annotation, improving prompting, extending to other reasoning tasks, and enabling smaller models. Overall, the authors paint LLMs as a promising new technique for table reasoning that warrants much additional research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to perform complex reasoning over tables using few-shot in-context learning. Instead of fine-tuning, only a few input-output examples are provided to the model. The authors evaluate prompting strategies like direct prediction, chain of thoughts, and self-consistency on datasets like WikiTableQuestions, FetaQA, TabFact, and FEVEROUS. The results show that with just 1-2 examples, LLMs can achieve surprisingly strong performance on par with or even exceeding some state-of-the-art models. For instance, GPT-3 obtained 48.8% on WikiTableQuestions and 78.8% on TabFact. The elicited reasoning chains were also found to be highly consistent with the true underlying reasoning process when predictions were correct. However, performance degraded substantially on very large tables. Overall, the study demonstrates LLMs have an emergent capability for table reasoning despite no table-specific training. The simple yet effective LLM baselines could serve as a strong foundation for future research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to perform complex reasoning over tables using few-shot in-context learning. Rather than fine-tuning the models, the authors provide just a few demonstrations of the input-output mapping to allow the LLMs to generalize to unseen examples. They evaluate methods like direct prediction, chain of thought prompting, and chain of thought with self-consistency on table QA and fact verification datasets. The results show that with just 1-2 examples, LLMs can achieve very competitive performance, even rivaling some state-of-the-art models that require full fine-tuning. For instance, GPT-3 gets 48.8% on WikiTableQuestions with 2 demonstrations. The elicited reasoning chains are also shown to be highly faithful to the true reasoning process. However, some limitations are the high cost of large LLMs, inability to handle very long tables, and occasional mistakes in symbolic reasoning. Overall, the work demonstrates the surprising effectiveness of LLMs for table reasoning with minimal training. The simple yet strong performance of LLMs with chain of thought prompting suggests they should be considered an important baseline for future table-based research. The rationales may also help reduce annotation needs. But there are still opportunities to combine neural methods like LLMs with more rigid symbolic techniques to get the best of both worlds.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 for few-shot learning on table reasoning tasks. Instead of fine-tuning the models on downstream tasks, the authors provide just a few examples as demonstrations to teach the model to solve unseen test examples. They experiment with different prompting strategies including direct prediction, chain of thoughts (CoT), and CoT with self-consistency. For CoT, the model generates an explicit reasoning chain to justify its prediction. For self-consistency, multiple diverse reasoning paths are generated and voted on to select the most consistent answer. The models are evaluated on table QA and fact verification datasets like WikiTableQuestions, FetaQA, TabFact, and FEVEROUS without any specialized pre-training on tables. The results show that LLMs can achieve strong performance on these tasks with just 1-2 shot prompting, even rivaling some state-of-the-art models. The elicited reasoning chains are also shown to be highly faithful to the underlying semantics. This demonstrates that large pre-trained language models have an emergent capability for complex table reasoning despite not being specifically optimized for it.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are addressing is understanding how well large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can perform on table reasoning tasks using few-shot learning, without any fine-tuning on table-specific data. The key questions they are investigating are:- Can LLMs effectively perform complex reasoning over table structures and data with just a few demonstrations, using prompt-based learning? - How do different prompting strategies like direct prediction, chain of thoughts, and self-consistency affect the reasoning performance of LLMs on tables?- How does the performance compare to existing state-of-the-art models on popular table QA and fact verification datasets?- What kinds of symbolic reasoning (e.g. counting, comparison, arithmetic operations) can LLMs perform accurately over tables? - What are some limitations and issues with using LLMs for table reasoning that still need to be addressed?So in summary, the main focus is on understanding and evaluating the few-shot table reasoning capabilities of large language models, without specialized training or fine-tuning on table data. The authors aim to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this approach as a baseline for future research.
