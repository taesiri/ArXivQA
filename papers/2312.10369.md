# [Proportional Representation in Metric Spaces and Low-Distortion   Committee Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of selecting a small set of representatives (a committee) from a larger set of candidates to represent a set of voters embedded in a metric space. The goal is for the selected committee to provide "proportional representation", meaning that large cohesive subgroups of voters should have their preferences suitably represented in the committee. The paper considers two information models - a cardinal model where the metric distances are known, and an ordinal model where only a ranking of the candidates by voters is known. The objective is to design algorithms that select committees providing good proportional representation even with limited ordinal information.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new notion called "$\gamma$-proportional representation" that formally captures the proportional representation desideratum. The definition requires that for every large enough subgroup of voters (coalition), there should exist a subset of the committee that is almost as good in serving that coalition as the best possible committee subset of the same size. 

The key algorithm analyzed is a special case of the Expanding Approvals Rule that works iteratively. In each round, the number of approved candidates per voter increases. Once enough voters approve a candidate, that candidate is added to the committee and those voters are removed. This continues until the committee size is met. 

Main Contributions:

1. A new definition of proportional representation for committee selection that strengthens prior work.

2. Proves that the Expanding Approvals Rule provides constant factor proportional representation guarantees even with only ordinal information about voters' preferences. This is also the first algorithm achieving constant proportional fairness with ordinal information.  

3. When metric distances are known, shows that a simple modification of prior work achieves better constant guarantees.

4. Establishes limitations on achievable guarantees by constructing hard instances. In particular, shows that some resource augmentation is essential for good guarantees when committee size is very small or very large compared to the number of voters.

The work gives a natural committee selection objective that works with limited ordinal information, provides algorithms with approximation guarantees, and highlights interesting open questions about closing the gap between achievable guarantees with ordinal vs cardinal information.
