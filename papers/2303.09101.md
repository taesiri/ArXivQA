# [Contrastive Semi-supervised Learning for Underwater Image Restoration   via Reliable Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09101)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for underwater image restoration. The central hypothesis is that by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner, the model can achieve better generalization performance on real-world underwater images compared to supervised methods trained only on limited labeled data. 

Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges in applying semi-supervised learning to underwater image restoration:

1. The pseudo-labels (predictions on unlabeled data) from the teacher model may be unreliable or even wrong, which can negatively impact student model training. 

2. The commonly used L1 loss for consistency between student and teacher outputs can easily cause overfitting to wrong pseudo-labels, resulting in confirmation bias.

To tackle the first challenge, the paper proposes building a "reliable bank" to only store the best pseudo-labels judged by a carefully selected non-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric. 

For the second challenge, the paper incorporates contrastive regularization to prevent overfitting to wrong pseudo-labels.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by addressing these two challenges via the proposed reliable bank and contrastive regularization, semi-supervised learning can improve generalization for underwater image restoration. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
