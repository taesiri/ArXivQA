# [Cross-Attention is All You Need: Adapting Pretrained Transformers for   Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08771)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How powerful is cross-attention in adapting pretrained transformers for machine translation to new language pairs? Specifically, the paper investigates the role of cross-attention layers when fine-tuning a pretrained machine translation model on a new language pair. It examines whether fine-tuning just the cross-attention layers can achieve comparable performance to fine-tuning the full model. The key hypotheses are:1) Fine-tuning only the cross-attention layers, while freezing the encoder and decoder modules, can adapt well to new language pairs and achieve close to full model fine-tuning performance. 2) The pretrained values of the cross-attention layers, encoding translation knowledge, are important for effective fine-tuning.3) Fine-tuning only cross-attention results in the new language embeddings becoming aligned with the original embeddings, unlike full fine-tuning.Through experiments fine-tuning pretrained French-English models on new language pairs, the paper provides empirical evidence supporting these hypotheses. Overall, it aims to demonstrate the power of cross-attention for transfer learning in machine translation and gain insights into its crucial role.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing the power of cross-attention in the Transformer architecture for machine translation, specifically in the context of transfer learning. The key findings are:- Fine-tuning only the cross-attention parameters of a pretrained translation model is nearly as effective as fine-tuning the entire model when adapting to translate a new language pair. This suggests cross-attention alone can effectively adapt to the new task while the encoder and decoder are frozen.- Fine-tuning solely cross-attention results in the new language embeddings becoming aligned with the corresponding embeddings in the pretrained model. This alignment effect does not happen when fine-tuning the full model.- The aligned embeddings can be utilized for mitigating catastrophic forgetting of the original task and enabling zero-shot translation between languages aligned to a common parent language.- Fine-tuning just cross-attention is a more lightweight way to adapt models to new languages compared to full fine-tuning, requiring fewer parameters to be updated and stored.In summary, the paper shows the power and importance of cross-attention for transfer learning in machine translation, and demonstrates how the resulting aligned embeddings can be exploited in useful ways. The constrained fine-tuning approach also has practical advantages for model adaptation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper shows that fine-tuning only the cross-attention layers of a pretrained neural machine translation model, while keeping the encoder and decoder bodies fixed, can achieve competitive translation quality compared to fine-tuning the entire model, and results in new language embeddings that align with the pretrained embeddings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:- The paper focuses specifically on studying the role and importance of cross-attention in transfer learning for neural machine translation (NMT). Most prior work has studied cross-attention in the context of training NMT models from scratch, not transfer learning. Looking at cross-attention through the lens of transfer learning is a novel angle.- The paper shows that fine-tuning just the cross-attention parameters of a pretrained NMT model, while freezing the encoder and decoder, can achieve strong performance on new translation tasks. This is an interesting finding that highlights the power and adaptability of cross-attention on its own. Other work has not specifically isolated cross-attention like this.- The paper demonstrates that fine-tuning only cross-attention leads to "aligned" cross-lingual embeddings between the new language and the language that was frozen. This alignment enables capabilities like zero-shot translation and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The analysis of the embedding space is a unique contribution.- Overall, the constrained transfer learning setups explored in the paper provide new insights into the crucial role and knowledge encoded in cross-attention layers in particular. The findings expand our understanding of how to effectively adapt pretrained Transformers.- Methodologically, the work is similar to other studies that have frozen or isolated components of Transformers. But it is novel in specifically focusing that analysis on cross-attention and transfer learning for NMT.In summary, the paper makes important empirical and analytical contributions around cross-attention in NMT transfer learning. The setups and findings meaningfully advance the literature in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several directions for future research:1) Conducting more analyses to gain deeper insights into the inner workings of different Transformer modules and how they can be utilized effectively. They encourage more studies in a similar investigative spirit.2) Exploring different ways of inducing cross-lingual alignment, beyond just freezing model components. This could lead to better alignment techniques.3) Comparing their lightweight fine-tuning approach to other methods like adapters, prompt tuning, etc. to understand the relative advantages and disadvantages. 4) Extending their zero-shot translation approach to more language pairs and evaluating the quality.5) Applying their findings to other modalities beyond just text, since Transformers are being used more broadly now. For example, could cross-attention transfer work for vision as well?6) Studying the effect of their approach when transferring to truly low-resource languages, since their experiments used medium-resource datasets. How far can cross-attention transfer go?7) Combining their method with other techniques like backtranslation to further improve performance when adapting to new languages.In summary, the main suggestions are to conduct more targeted analyses to reveal insights, compare to other methods, apply the approach to new settings/tasks, and combine it with complementary techniques for greater gains. The overall goal is to better understand and extend the cross-attention transfer capability.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper studies the power of cross-attention in the Transformer architecture for transfer learning in machine translation. The authors conduct experiments transferring from a pretrained French-English model to other language pairs by either changing the source or target language. They find that fine-tuning only the cross-attention parameters, in addition to new target language embeddings, achieves nearly the same performance as fine-tuning the entire model. This suggests cross-attention alone can effectively adapt the model to new translation tasks while other parameters remain fixed. Further analysis shows that with cross-attention-only fine-tuning, the new language embeddings become aligned with the original pretrained embeddings, enabling applications like mitigating catastrophic forgetting and zero-shot translation. The findings highlight the crucial role of cross-attention and encoded translation knowledge in adapting Transformers, while enabling more lightweight fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper investigates the importance of cross-attention in pretrained Transformer models for machine translation. It focuses on transfer learning experiments where a pretrained French-English translation model is fine-tuned on new language pairs by changing either the source or target language. The authors compare fine-tuning strategies where only the cross-attention parameters are updated versus fine-tuning the entire model. The results show that updating just the cross-attention and embedding parameters leads to performance nearly on par with full fine-tuning, suggesting cross-attention alone can effectively leverage encoded translation knowledge. Analysis reveals this cross-attention-only fine-tuning aligns the new language embeddings with the original pretrained embeddings, enabling applications like mitigating catastrophic forgetting and zero-shot translation. Overall, the paper provides evidence for the crucial role of cross-attention and the utility of selective fine-tuning focused on cross-attention. The findings offer insights for researchers into model adaptability and for practitioners needing to extend models to new languages efficiently.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a technique to study the importance of cross-attention in transfer learning for neural machine translation. The key method is to take a pretrained French-English translation model and fine-tune it on new translation tasks by freezing different modules of the model. Specifically, they compare fine-tuning strategies of updating only the new language embeddings, updating all parameters, or updating just the cross-attention parameters while freezing the encoder and decoder bodies. This allows them to isolate the effectiveness of cross-attention for transfer learning. Their main finding is that fine-tuning cross-attention is nearly as effective as fine-tuning all parameters, suggesting cross-attention alone can adapt the model to new translation tasks. They also analyze the learned embeddings and find cross-attention fine-tuning aligns embeddings to the parent model, enabling applications like mitigating forgetting and zero-shot translation. Overall, the constrained fine-tuning setups allow them to demonstrate the power and utility of cross-attention for transfer learning in neural machine translation.
