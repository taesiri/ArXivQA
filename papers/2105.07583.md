# [ItôTTS and ItôWave: Linear Stochastic Differential Equation Is All   You Need For Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:Can a unified framework based on linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) be used to model both text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis and vocoding for high-quality audio generation? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A pair of forward and reverse time linear SDEs can model the transformation of mel spectrogram or waveform distributions into simpler tractable distributions and back. 2) The gradients of the log probability densities of these distributions, known as "scores", can be approximated with neural networks.3) Using these estimated scores to drive reverse time SDEs or Langevin dynamics allows sampling from the true mel spectrogram or waveform distributions.4) This unified SDE framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on both TTS (predicting mel spectrograms from text) and vocoding (predicting waveforms from mel spectrograms).So in summary, the central research question is whether linear SDEs can provide a unified high-quality generative model for both major components of speech synthesis by modeling distribution transformations and using estimated scores. The key hypotheses relate to the viability of this SDE approach for both TTS and vocoding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes two neural network models, ItôTTS and ItôWave, for text-to-speech synthesis and vocoding based on linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Here are the main contributions:- The authors propose to unify text-to-speech and vocoding into a single framework based on forward and reverse-time linear SDEs. The forward SDE transforms the mel spectrogram/waveform distribution into a simple tractable distribution. The reverse SDE generates the target from the simple distribution.- ItôTTS and ItôWave use the Wiener process as a driver to gradually subtract excess signal from noise to generate realistic mel spectrograms and audio under text and mel spectrogram conditions.- The authors propose network architectures suitable for predicting the scores (gradients of log densities) needed for the reverse SDE sampling. ItôTTS uses an encoder-decoder structure. ItôWave uses a network with dilated residual blocks. - Experiments show ItôTTS and ItôWave exceed current state-of-the-art methods in quality, with mean opinion scores of 3.925 and 4.35 respectively.- The main contribution is providing a unified SDE framework for high-quality text-to-speech and vocoding, with flexible network architectures tailored for audio generation. The results and code provide a strong baseline for future SDE-based audio work.In summary, the key innovation is the use of paired forward and reverse-time linear SDEs to transform distributions for high-quality and flexible audio generation under a unified framework.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related research:- The paper proposes novel TTS and vocoder models called ItôTTS and ItôWave that are based on linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs). This is a unique approach compared to most existing TTS and vocoder models that use neural networks like RNNs, CNNs, GANs, normalizing flows, etc. Using SDEs to model and generate audio signals is an interesting new direction.- The only other work I'm aware of that uses SDEs for audio generation is Grad-TTS by Popov et al. (2021). Both Grad-TTS and ItôTTS use the SDE framework to model mel spectrograms for TTS. However, ItôTTS uses a different network architecture and training approach compared to Grad-TTS. Also, ItôTTS proposes a unified SDE framework for both TTS and vocoder, which is novel.- For TTS, ItôTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance with a MOS of 3.925, slightly better than recent models like Tacotron 2 and FastSpeech 2. The vocoder ItôWave also achieves state-of-the-art MOS of 4.35, surpassing WaveNet, WaveGlow, Diffwave, etc.- The idea of using the score matching technique to estimate the gradient of the data density, instead of the density itself, is inspired by Hyvarinen (2005) and Song & Ermon (2019). Adapting this idea to generate audio signals is quite innovative.- Overall, modeling mel spectrograms and audio waves with SDEs is a promising new direction for generative audio modeling. The unified SDE framework for both TTS and vocoder, and the specific model architectures in ItôTTS and ItôWave, are novel contributions compared to prior arts. The strong results demonstrate the potential of this approach.In summary, the key novelties of this work compared to other research are the use of SDEs for audio modeling, the specific model architectures proposed, and the unified SDE framework for both TTS and vocoder tasks. The results are state-of-the-art, highlighting the promise of this new approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing other types of linear SDEs that are suitable for audio generation, and discovering principles to determine which types of SDEs work best. The authors used variance exploding (VE) SDE for wave generation and variance preserving (VP) SDE for spectrogram generation, but suggest exploring other formulations.- Studying how different choices of drift and diffusion coefficients in the SDE affect generation quality, and how to select these to optimize results. The coefficients determine how the noise is added over time in the diffusion process.- Improving sampling speed under a trained score network, to increase generation efficiency. This could involve modifications to the sampling algorithms.- Extending the linear SDE framework to generate discrete data, such as MIDI music. The current approach focuses on continuous spectrogram or waveform generation. Adapting the technique for note sequences could enable musical generation applications. - Developing alternative score prediction network architectures tailored for audio generation tasks. The authors propose two network structures, but suggest there is room for improvement.In summary, the main directions are developing specialized linear SDE variants for audio, optimizing model hyperparameters like the SDE coefficients, speeding up generation, and expanding the approach to discrete data like MIDI. The core SDE framework shows promise, but can likely be improved with further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new framework for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis and vocoding based on linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The key idea is to model the generation of mel spectrograms from text and audio waveforms from mel spectrograms as diffusion processes modeled by forward-time and reverse-time linear SDEs respectively. The forward SDE gradually adds noise to simplify the data distribution while the reverse SDE gradually generates the target data distribution through a scoring process. Neural networks are trained to predict the scores (gradients of the data log-likelihood) that are needed to drive the reverse SDE. Experiments on the LJ Speech dataset show the proposed TTS method (ItôTTS) exceeds state-of-the-art autoregressive and non-autoregressive models in terms of mean opinion scores. Similarly, the proposed vocoder method (ItôWave) outperforms existing flow-based and GAN-based vocoders. The simplicity of linear SDEs compared to normalizing flows and GANs is a notable advantage.
