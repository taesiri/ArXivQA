# [ItôTTS and ItôWave: Linear Stochastic Differential Equation Is All   You Need For Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:Can a unified framework based on linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) be used to model both text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis and vocoding for high-quality audio generation? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A pair of forward and reverse time linear SDEs can model the transformation of mel spectrogram or waveform distributions into simpler tractable distributions and back. 2) The gradients of the log probability densities of these distributions, known as "scores", can be approximated with neural networks.3) Using these estimated scores to drive reverse time SDEs or Langevin dynamics allows sampling from the true mel spectrogram or waveform distributions.4) This unified SDE framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on both TTS (predicting mel spectrograms from text) and vocoding (predicting waveforms from mel spectrograms).So in summary, the central research question is whether linear SDEs can provide a unified high-quality generative model for both major components of speech synthesis by modeling distribution transformations and using estimated scores. The key hypotheses relate to the viability of this SDE approach for both TTS and vocoding.
