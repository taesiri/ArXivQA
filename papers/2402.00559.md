# [A Chain-of-Thought Is as Strong as Its Weakest Link: A Benchmark for   Verifiers of Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00559)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Complex reasoning tasks require answering questions through a chain of reasoning steps. Encouraging language models (LMs) to provide reasoning chains (e.g. Chain-of-Thought format) improves performance.
- However, current evaluation focuses only on final answer correctness, not on verifying reasoning chain correctness. Recent work proposes methods to automatically verify reasoning chains but lacks labeled data to evaluate them.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a formalism for step-wise verification of attribution (correctness to source) and logical correctness of reasoning steps. 
- Introduce a 2-task annotation schema to label chain steps for relevance, type (attribution, logic or both), attribution to evidence paragraphs from Wikipedia, and logical correctness.
- Collect a new benchmark dataset, Reveal, with over 3,000 reasoning chain steps from 704 open-domain QA instances, answered by 3 LMs.
- Provide detailed step-level labels on relevance, type, attribution and logical correctness. Includes justifications and two subsets - high agreement Eval set and more complex Open set.

Main Contributions:
- Formalism and methodology for verifying reasoning chains
- Reliable annotation schema for executing the verification methodology
- New labeled benchmark Reveal for evaluating reasoning chain verifiers with a variety of settings
- Detailed data analyses - unsupported claims, disagreement categories
- Experiments showing challenges for current state-of-the-art verifiers

The paper focuses on providing a reliable benchmark to advance research on verifying reasoning chains generated by LMs, in order to improve complex reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Reveal, a new dataset for evaluating the ability of systems to verify the logical correctness and factual attribution of reasoning steps in chain-of-thought answers to complex reasoning questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(I) A protocol for step-by-step verification of reasoning chains. This includes defining concepts like step relevance, step type (attribution, logical, or both), attribution correctness, and logical correctness.

(II) An annotation schema to reliably execute the verification protocol with human annotators. This includes splitting the annotation task into two parts - one focused on logic and the other on attribution.

(III) A new benchmark dataset, Reveal, for evaluating automatic reasoning chain verifiers. The dataset contains over 700 questions from 4 QA datasets, with over 1000 reasoning chain answers and over 3000 reasoning steps. Each step has detailed labels and justifications.

(IV) Detailed analyses of challenges in retrieving evidence for knowledge claims in reasoning chains and documentation of disagreement cases in the dataset.

(V) A study on the challenges current verification methods face on the collected benchmark, showing significant room for improvement.

The key focus is on enabling thorough evaluation of automatic methods for verifying the correctness of reasoning chains generated by language models, by providing a diverse benchmark dataset with fine-grained step-level labels.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Chain-of-Thought (CoT): A common prompting format where language models provide step-by-step reasoning to arrive at an answer.

- Reasoning chains: Sequences of reasoning steps generated by language models to justify an answer. 

- Verification: Evaluating and validating the correctness of reasoning chains.

- Attribution: Grounding claims in reasoning chains to external evidence sources. 

- Logical correctness: Validating whether each reasoning step correctly follows from previous steps.

- Benchmark dataset: The paper introduces a new dataset called REVEAL for evaluating reasoning chain verifiers.

- NLI: Natural language inference, a task used for verifying attribution steps.

- Annotation schema: A protocol to collect human judgments on reasoning chain verification.

In summary, the key focus is on verifying reasoning chains from language models, by evaluating attribution to evidence and logical correctness between steps. The paper contributes a methodology, dataset, analyses, and benchmarks for this task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed annotation schema balance annotation quality, ease of use, and scalability? What design choices were made and why?

2. The paper splits the annotation process into two independent tasks - attribution and logic verification. What is the rationale behind this? What are the benefits?

3. What analyzes does the paper conduct on the "unsupported" attribution steps? What insights and estimates do they provide about the causes of lack of evidence support?

4. What are some of the key complexity categories that lead to disagreement between annotators in the open-label dataset subset? Provide 2-3 examples. 

5. How does the paper formally define the task of verifying reasoning chains for attribution and logical correctness? What assumptions does this formalism make?

6. What are some limitations of using CoT format for reasoning chains? When would CoT formats not apply or be insufficient? 

7. The paper benchmarks several strong baseline verifiers. What trends do you see in their performance on attribution vs logical verification sub-tasks? Why do you think current verifiers struggle more with logical correctness?

8. What implications does the paper discuss regarding using the attribution step-evidence pairs as an NLI benchmark? What advantages or limitations might this bring over existing NLI datasets?

9. The free-text justifications are mentioned as potentially valuable for research directions like explanation generation. What characteristics ensure these justifications are high quality?

10. If you wanted to expand the coverage of reasoning skills in the benchmark dataset, what other complex reasoning skills would you aim to add more examples for, and why?
