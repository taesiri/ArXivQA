# [Constraint Model for the Satellite Image Mosaic Selection Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04210)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new combinatorial optimization problem called the Satellite Image Mosaic Selection (SIMS) problem, which involves selecting an optimal subset of overlapping satellite images to stitch together to create a mosaic covering a given area of interest (AOI). The objectives are to minimize the total cost, cloud coverage, resolution, and incidence angle of the mosaic. The authors propose constraint programming (CP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models. A key challenge is modeling the cloud coverage since clouds are unevenly distributed in images, so the authors preprocess the images to integrate cloud information. They generate a realistic dataset of instances with up to 200 SPOT, Pléiades and Pléiades Neo satellite images covering regions worldwide. In experiments, the CP model solved with OR-tools performs the best overall, but the MILP approach also shows promise, especially for smaller instances. This is an important step towards automated optimization of satellite image selection for applications like environmental monitoring, urban development analysis and more. The flexibility of the CP model will also allow extending this problem to additional objectives.
