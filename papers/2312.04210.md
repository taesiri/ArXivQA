# [Constraint Model for the Satellite Image Mosaic Selection Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04210)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new combinatorial optimization problem called the Satellite Image Mosaic Selection (SIMS) problem, which involves selecting an optimal subset of overlapping satellite images to stitch together to create a mosaic covering a given area of interest (AOI). The objectives are to minimize the total cost, cloud coverage, resolution, and incidence angle of the mosaic. The authors propose constraint programming (CP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models. A key challenge is modeling the cloud coverage since clouds are unevenly distributed in images, so the authors preprocess the images to integrate cloud information. They generate a realistic dataset of instances with up to 200 SPOT, Pléiades and Pléiades Neo satellite images covering regions worldwide. In experiments, the CP model solved with OR-tools performs the best overall, but the MILP approach also shows promise, especially for smaller instances. This is an important step towards automated optimization of satellite image selection for applications like environmental monitoring, urban development analysis and more. The flexibility of the CP model will also allow extending this problem to additional objectives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new combinatorial problem called the satellite image mosaic selection problem, which seeks to find an optimal subset of overlapping satellite images covering an area of interest to create a mosaic by optimizing objectives like cost, resolution, incidence angle, and cloud coverage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Introducing the satellite image mosaic selection problem (SIMS) and presenting a constraint programming (CP) model as well as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that can successfully find solutions to real instances of up to 200 images. The models aim to optimize multiple objectives related to the selection of satellite images for mosaic generation, including cost, resolution, incidence angle, and cloud coverage. The paper also proposes a dataset of realistic and challenging instances for evaluating the models.

So in summary, the key contributions are:

- Formally defining the new SIMS problem for optimal satellite image selection for mosaics
- Proposing CP and MILP models to solve the SIMS problem 
- Introducing a new dataset of realistic instances 
- Evaluating the proposed models on instances with up to 200 images

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper relies on a discretization step to simplify the geometric representations. What impact could this preprocessing step have on the quality of the final solutions? Could we lose some optimal solutions?

2. The constraint model handles the cloud coverage by assigning a binary cloudy/non-cloudy attribute to each part of the images. How could a more fine-grained uncertainty representation for the presence of clouds impact the model?

3. The paper mentions extending the model for new non-linear requirements. What kind of satellite image properties could lead to non-linear formulations and how could they be modeled? 

4. The paper uses a simple greedy search heuristic for the constraint model. What other more sophisticated search strategies from constraint programming could be relevant for this problem?

5. The mixed integer programming model uses an ε-constraint method to generate the Pareto front. What are the limitations of this approach? How do they compare to the algorithm used for the constraint model?  

6. The results show that the MILP model scales worse than the CP model. What improvements could be made to the MILP formulation to handle larger instances?

7. The problem is modeled as a weighted set cover problem. What other problem representations could be relevant, such as packing or clustering formulations? What would be the advantages and limitations?

8. Real-world instances can have additional constraints on the selected images such as maximal age or time windows. How could those be integrated in the current models?

9. The model currently considers 4 objectives. What other image properties could be relevant to include in the multiobjective optimization? What difficulties would they raise in the model?  

10. The experiments are limited to 200 images. What hardware improvements or algorithmic enhancements would be necessary to scale the approach to thousands of images?
