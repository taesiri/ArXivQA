# [Sim-to-Real Causal Transfer: A Metric Learning Approach to   Causally-Aware Interaction Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04540)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper takes an in-depth look at learning causally-aware representations for modeling multi-agent interactions. It first critically analyzes the recent CausalAgents benchmark, pointing out issues with its labeling and evaluation protocols that can lead to biased measurements of robustness. The authors then construct a diagnostic dataset using counterfactual simulations to facilitate more rigorous analysis. Experiments on this dataset reveal that while recent models are already partially resilient to non-causal perturbations, they still struggle with capturing indirect causal effects involving mediator agents. To address this, the authors propose a metric learning approach to regularize representations based on causal annotations of varying granularity. Controlled experiments demonstrate that this regularization boosts causal awareness and out-of-distribution robustness. Finally, a sim-to-real causal transfer framework is introduced that extends these benefits to real-world settings by exploiting stable causal mechanisms across domains. Experiments show that this causal transfer enables stronger generalization even without real-world causal labels. In summary, this work provides critical analysis and effective solutions towards learning causally-aware representations of multi-agent interactions.
