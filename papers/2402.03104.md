# [High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Covariance Matrix Adaptation   Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Bayesian optimization (BO) is an effective approach for optimizing expensive black-box functions. However, applying BO to high-dimensional problems remains challenging due to issues like the curse of dimensionality, heterogeneity of the objective function, and over-exploration of the search space. Existing methods to address these issues have certain limitations. For example, methods based on additive decomposition of the objective function depend heavily on the additive assumption. Methods using neural networks as surrogates do not provide uncertainty estimates. Methods based on random embeddings cannot guarantee that the low-dimensional space contains the optima. Local search methods depend critically on how the local regions are defined. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel meta-algorithm that leverages the Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA) strategy to systematically define promising local regions to guide the search. Specifically, CMA maintains a multivariate normal search distribution to estimate the probabilities of points being the global optima. The local regions are then defined as hyper-ellipsoids centered at the distribution mean and containing a high percentage of the distribution's probability mass. Existing BO optimizers like standard BO, TuRBO, and BAxUS can be used within these regions to find the optima efficiently. As the search distribution is updated iteratively using the CMA equations, the local regions move towards more promising areas, balancing exploration and exploitation.

The CMA technique helps address key issues in high-dimensional BO:
(1) The local search reduces heterogeneity. 
(2) Limiting the search space reduces over-exploration.
(3) The search distribution provides guidance towards promising areas.

This meta-algorithm is combined with standard BO, TuRBO, and BAxUS to derive CMA-BO, CMA-TuRBO, and CMA-BAxUS algorithms. These build on the strengths of both CMA and state-of-the-art BO methods.

Contributions:
- A CMA-based meta-algorithm for high-dimensional BO using local search
- Algorithms combining the meta-algorithm with standard BO, TuRBO, and BAxUS 
- Comprehensive evaluation showing superior performance over existing methods

The proposed technique helps make BO more effective for optimizing high-dimensional expensive black-box functions. By strategically defining local regions using CMA, it balances exploration-exploitation and guides the search towards promising areas. The integration with state-of-the-art BO methods enhances their optimization capability.
