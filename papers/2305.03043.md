# [Single-Shot Implicit Morphable Faces with Consistent Texture   Parameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03043)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to model 3D faces that are both high-fidelity and controllable for animation. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a 3D face model that:- Can capture high-quality photo-realistic geometry and texture details from a single view RGB image.- Has an interpretable and intuitive parameterization to enable control over facial expressions and appearance.- Supports extracting editable assets like texture maps for downstream applications.To achieve these goals, the key idea is combining implicit neural representations (for geometry) with explicit texture parameterizations (for appearance). The main hypotheses are:1) An implicit geometry representation like a neural SDF can capture higher quality shape details compared to traditional mesh-based 3DMMs.2) Learning an explicit UV texture map provides more control over appearance compared to a fully implicit texture representation.3) Enforcing consistency of the UV mapping with facial landmark constraints enables better single-view reconstruction.The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by comparing the proposed hybrid model against purely implicit models, purely explicit mesh-based models, and ablated versions on tasks like novel view synthesis, facial animation, and single-image 3D inversion. The results generally confirm the benefits of the hybrid approach.In summary, the key novelty and contribution is in proposing this hybrid geometry-implicit and texture-explicit model to get the best of both representations for high-fidelity and controllable digital human face modeling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a novel hybrid 3D morphable face model that combines the benefits of implicit representations and explicit texture maps. Specifically, the model uses a signed distance function (SDF) to represent facial geometry and an explicit UV parameterization to represent facial texture.- Presenting a framework for single-image 3D face reconstruction by inverting an input photo into the latent space of the pre-trained model. The reconstructed avatar can be rendered from novel views, supports non-linear facial animation, and enables intuitive texture editing.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy on in-the-wild images for photo-realistic rendering, geometry, and expression transfer compared to prior methods.In summary, this paper introduces a hybrid 3D morphable face model that achieves both high fidelity reconstruction and intuitive control over facial geometry, textures, and expressions from a single image. The key innovation is combining implicit SDFs with explicit UV texture maps to get the benefits of both representations. The results show improved performance over previous mesh-based and implicit 3D face models for tasks like novel view synthesis, texture editing, and facial reenactment.
