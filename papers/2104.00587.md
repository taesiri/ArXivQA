# [NeRF-VAE: A Geometry Aware 3D Scene Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00587)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research aim is to develop a 3D scene generative model called NeRF-VAE that incorporates geometric structure and can generate novel photorealistic scenes. The key ideas and hypotheses are:

- By combining neural radiance fields (NeRF) with amortized variational inference, the model can learn to infer the structure of new scenes from just a few input views, without needing to retrain from scratch like vanilla NeRF. 

- Modeling scenes using an explicit 3D rendering process with NeRF as the decoder will lead to better cross-view consistency compared to prior work like GQNs that use 2D convolutional decoders.

- Learning a latent distribution over radiance fields conditioned on a scene representation vector will allow sharing information across scenes and enable sampling of new scenes.

- An attention-based conditioning mechanism for the NeRF decoder can improve conditioning on the latent code compared to just using MLPs.

So in summary, the central aim is developing a geometry-aware generative model for novel 3D scenes that can do efficient amortized inference and generation while maintaining cross-view consistency. The key hypotheses relate to the benefits of combining NeRF with variational inference, using explicit 3D rendering, and employing attention for conditioning.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop a 3D scene generative model that incorporates geometric structure and can generalize to novel scenes. The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question are:

- Using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and differentiable volume rendering as the decoder in a variational autoencoder framework. This allows modeling scene geometry explicitly. 

- Introducing a latent variable that captures per-scene information, while the decoder network learns to model shared structure across scenes. This allows generalization to novel scenes.

- Developing an inference network that can infer the latent variable from just a few views of a new scene. This enables efficient amortized inference without needing to optimize the model for each new scene separately.

- Comparing the model (termed NeRF-VAE) to baselines like NeRF and more convolution-based generative models. The results demonstrate NeRF-VAE can reconstruct scenes from fewer views, generalizes better to novel camera positions, and produces consistent geometry.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that incorporating explicit 3D geometric structure via NeRFs, along with amortized inference over a latent variable capturing scene-specific details, can enable developing scene generative models that generalize well to novel scenes. The NeRF-VAE model is proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes NeRF-VAE, a 3D scene generative model that incorporates geometric structure via NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) and differentiable volume rendering. In contrast to NeRF, NeRF-VAE can capture shared structure across scenes and infer the structure of a novel scene without needing to retrain.

2. NeRF-VAE is a VAE that learns a distribution over radiance fields by conditioning them on a latent scene representation. Once trained, it can infer and render geometrically-consistent scenes from just a few input views of a new environment. 

3. The paper shows that NeRF-VAE generalizes well to out-of-distribution camera positions, while convolutional models like GQN do not. This demonstrates the benefits of the explicit 3D rendering process in NeRF-VAE.

4. The paper introduces and studies an attention-based conditioning mechanism for the NeRF-VAE decoder, which improves the model's performance by allowing flexible conditioning on a high-dimensional spatial latent code.

5. More broadly, the paper demonstrates the promise of combining implicit neural scene representations like NeRF with deep generative models to enable rendering and sampling of novel 3D scenes. The amortized inference procedure also makes this approach much more practical compared to optimizing a NeRF model from scratch for each new scene.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing NeRF-VAE, a generative model that leverages NeRF's differentiable rendering within a VAE framework to enable efficient inference and sampling of 3D scenes with view consistency. The experiments demonstrate the benefits of this approach over both standard NeRF and convolutional generative models.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NeRF-VAE, a 3D scene generative model that combines neural radiance fields and volumetric rendering with variational autoencoders to represent scenes compactly and enable efficient amortized inference and sampling of novel scenes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I would summarize its comparisons to other related research:

- This work builds on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by introducing a probabilistic generative model framework. Compared to NeRF, it allows amortized inference of scene properties and generation of novel scenes, rather than requiring optimization from scratch for each scene. 

- It is similar in spirit to Generative Query Networks (GQNs), in that it defines a distribution over scene functions that can be sampled to render novel views. The key difference is that GQN uses convolutional networks for rendering, while this work uses an explicit 3D rendering process with NeRF that enforces geometric consistency.

- Compared to other amortized neural rendering methods like PixelNeRF and MetaNeRF, this model uses a compact latent scene representation rather than requiring projection into the input view space. This allows rendering of arbitrary views rather than being limited to provided viewpoints.

- It differs from GAN approaches like HoloGAN and GRAF which don't have an explicit inference procedure. The VAE framework allows inference of a latent scene from observed views.

- Compared to other NeRF extensions that handle dynamic scenes, this work maintains a single latent per scene and does not model dynamics explicitly. But the latent variable may allow extensions to video modeling.

- The attention-based conditioning of the scene function is a novel contribution compared to prior work, and is shown to improve generalization and reconstruction quality.

In summary, the key innovations of this work compared to prior art seem to be 1) the amortized inference of a compact latent scene representation using NeRF, 2) the improved generalization from using an explicit geometric 3D rendering process, and 3) the attention-based conditioning mechanism for the scene function. The combination of these contributions appears quite unique in the literature.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on NeRF-VAE compares to other research on 3D scene generation and novel view synthesis:

- It builds on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by making the model generative and able to handle multiple scenes. This contrasts with the original NeRF which was discriminative and trained separately for each scene. 

- Compared to other generative models like GQN, NeRF-VAE uses an explicit 3D rendering process based on volumetric ray marching. This makes it more geometrically consistent across views compared to GQN which uses 2D convolutions.

- Unlike some other work that meta-learns NeRF optimizations or uses pixelNeRF, NeRF-VAE introduces an latent vector that captures per-scene information. This allows for efficient amortized inference on new scenes.

- It compares well against autoregressive convolutional models like the GQN baseline on generalization tests, especially on out-of-distribution camera views where the geometric consistency of NeRF-VAE shines.

- The spatial attention mechanism for conditioning the scene function is novel compared to prior work and shown to improve performance.

Overall, NeRF-VAE moves NeRF in a more flexible and generative direction while preserving its geometric strengths. The amortized inference and spatial attention helpInference while generalizing better than purely convolutional models. It's an incremental but solid step towards scalable, geometrically consistent generative models for novel view synthesis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Extending the model to handle dynamic scenes and videos, by adding a latent dynamics model like in Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2020). Since NeRF-VAE introduces a latent variable, it should be possible to model videos by adding temporal dependencies between the latents.

- Increasing the expressivity and capacity of the per-scene latent variable. Currently, the latent needs to be low-dimensional to allow for amortized inference. However, the authors suggest exploring ways to dynamically grow the latent capacity based on scene complexity.

- Improving the conditioning mechanisms between the latent variable and scene function. They propose exploring more advanced attention-based mechanisms than the simple one they introduced.

- Generalizing the model to be able to infer and render scenes with varying lighting conditions, transient effects, and other factors that violate the static scene assumption. This could build off NeRF-W (Martin-Brualla et al., 2020).

- Exploring conditional variants of the model, for example conditioning on text or object keypoints to control the generated scenes.

- Applying the amortized inference procedure to related neural rendering models beyond NeRF.

In summary, the main directions are improving the model's capacity and expressivity, extending it to dynamic scenes, and applying the amortization concepts more broadly to other neural rendering models. The latent variable also creates opportunities for controllable generation and conditional models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Extending NeRF-VAE to model dynamic scenes and videos, by incorporating a latent dynamics model like Dreamer. Since NeRF-VAE already has a latent variable per scene, it may be possible to extend it to model video sequences in a way that is more efficient than other methods like NeRF-W or NeRFies.

- Increasing the expressivity and capacity of NeRF-VAE's per-scene representation. The compact latent variable limits the complexity NeRF-VAE can represent per scene compared to regular NeRF. Exploring ways to dynamically grow the latent based on scene complexity could help.

- Further improving the attention-based conditioning mechanism between the latent variable and scene function. While attention already improves results, the authors suggest more sophisticated attention mechanisms like in GRFT could lead to additional gains.

- Exploring alternatives to amortized feedforward inference like they use, to better leverage the geometric structure. The authors note their iterative amortized inference only uses the geometric structure implicitly through the ELBO gradients.

- Applying NeRF-VAE to real-world datasets, which have more complexity than the synthetic data used in the paper. Evaluating how well the model can capture real scene properties and generalize.

- Scaling NeRF-VAE to explicitly model multiple objects and their relations, building on top of methods like NeRFies. The current model has a single scene latent.

- Combining NeRF-VAE with explicit 3D coordinate-based modules or losses to help capture geometric structure. The current model uses only images and implicit geometry from NeRF.

In summary, extending to video and dynamic scenes, improving the latent representation, inference and conditioning mechanisms, and scaling to real complex data seem like the key directions highlighted.

In the experiments, NeRF-VAE is compared to NeRF in terms of reconstruction error as a function of number of input views. With few views, NeRF-VAE significantly outperforms NeRF which needs many views to reach comparable performance. NeRF-VAE is also compared to a convolutional autoregressive VAE baseline. While both achieve similar reconstruction error, NeRF-VAE generalizes much better to out-of-distribution cameras. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed attention-based conditioning. Finally, NeRF-VAE is shown to produce high quality scene samples and capture geometric uncertainty from limited observations. In summary, NeRF-VAE introduces a geometry-aware scene representation that enables efficient amortized inference from few views as well as sampling of novel scenes.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes NeRF-VAE, a 3D scene generative model that incorporates geometric structure via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and differentiable volume rendering. The model is a variational autoencoder (VAE) that learns a distribution over radiance fields by conditioning them on a latent scene representation. 

During training, the model takes as input multiple images from different scenes, along with the corresponding camera positions/orientations. It embeds common scene properties across the dataset in the parameters of the encoder and decoder. 

Once trained, the model can infer parameters of a new scene in constant time, even from a single view. It does this by encoding the input views into an approximate posterior over the latent variable, which then conditions the radiance field to reconstruct the scene. The model can also sample novel scenes by sampling the latent variable from the prior.

Compared to NeRF, NeRF-VAE shares information between scenes and does not need costly per-scene optimization. Compared to other convolutional generative models like GQNs, it better handles novel viewpoints and geometry. The explicit 3D rendering also makes it more consistent across views than models lacking geometric structure.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is proposing a 3D scene generative model called NeRF-VAE that incorporates geometric structure via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and differentiable volume rendering. The key ideas and problems addressed are:

- NeRF requires optimizing a separate radiance field from scratch for each scene, which is slow and data-hungry. NeRF-VAE introduces amortized inference via a latent variable and shared parameters to allow efficiently inferring novel scenes without retraining. 

- Existing convolutional generative models like GQN lack geometric consistency across views. NeRF-VAE uses an explicit 3D rendering process with NeRF to achieve consistency.

- NeRF-VAE can infer and render novel scenes from very few input views, leveraging its learned prior over scenes. NeRF struggles with few views. 

- NeRF-VAE generalizes much better than convolutional models to out-of-distribution camera views, thanks to its geometric 3D rendering process.

- NeRF-VAE introduces a conditional latent variable model over radiance fields. This allows sampling and rendering novel scenes and handling missing data.

In summary, the key problems are the slow per-scene optimization of NeRF, lack of consistency and generalization in convolutional generative models like GQN, and handling novel scenes from limited data. NeRF-VAE proposes a conditional latent variable model with explicit 3D rendering to address these issues.
