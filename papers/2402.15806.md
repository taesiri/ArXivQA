# [Sequential Visual and Semantic Consistency for Semi-supervised Text   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Scene text recognition (STR) aims to transcribe text content from images. It has many applications but requires large amounts of training data. Collecting and labeling real images is expensive and synthetic data has domain gaps from real images, degrading performance. Semi-supervised learning can help by using unlabeled real images, but existing methods have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel semi-supervised STR framework with multi-granularity and multi-modal consistency regularization. It enforces consistency between predictions from weakly and strongly augmented views of unlabeled images. Besides existing character-level consistency (CCR), it introduces:

1) Word-level visual consistency via shortest path alignment of sequential visual features using dynamic programming. This mitigates misalignment from incorrect predictions in CCR.  

2) Word-level semantic consistency via reinforcement learning to optimize semantic similarity of predicted words in embedding space. This distinguishes visually similar but semantically different characters.

Main Contributions:

1) A shortest path loss module using dynamic programming that enforces word-level visual consistency and handles misalignments better than CCR

2) A reinforcement learning based module for word-level semantic consistency that incorporates semantic information to differentiate visually similar characters

3) State-of-the-art STR performance by combining hierarchical consistency constraints, outperforming previous semi-supervised methods on standard and more challenging benchmarks

4) Demonstrates great potential of unlabeled real images for improving STR with semi-supervised learning

The framework effectively regularizes STR models with multi-granularity and multi-modal alignment cues to enhance robustness. Experiments exhibit significant and consistent improvements, proving the approach's superiority. Unlabeled real images provide valuable extra information for semi-supervised STR.
