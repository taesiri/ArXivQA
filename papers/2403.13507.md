# [FMM-Attack: A Flow-based Multi-modal Adversarial Attack on Video-based   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13507)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video-based large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, their adversarial robustness remains unexplored. 

- Prior work has shown that introducing another modality like vision makes models more susceptible to safety issues compared to single-modality LLM counterparts. This highlights the need to study adversarial attacks for video-based LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FMM-Attack, the first adversarial attack method tailored for video-based LLMs. 

- FMM-Attack crafts imperceptible perturbations on a small fraction of frames in a video to induce incorrect or garbled responses from the victim models.

- Two objective functions target video features and LLM features respectively. A flow-based temporal mask selects the most effective frames to perturb based on optical flow.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive investigation regarding the vulnerability of video-based LLMs to adversarial attacks.

- Introduction of FMM-Attack, the first attack method designed specifically for video-based LLMs.

- Analysis of cross-modal feature attacks provides insights into multi-modal robustness and safety-related feature alignment.  

- Experiments demonstrate FMM-Attack can effectively trigger incorrect or garbled responses from multiple benchmark video-based LLMs by modifying less than 20% of frames.

In summary, the paper performs an in-depth exploration into the adversarial robustness of video-based LLMs, proposes a novel attack method, and provides analysis that inspires future research into ensuring reliability and security for video-based multi-modal models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FMM-Attack, the first adversarial attack method tailored for video-based large language models, which can effectively induce them to generate incorrect or nonsensical responses by crafting imperceptible perturbations on a small fraction of video frames.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The paper makes several key contributions:

1) It proposes the first comprehensive investigation regarding the adversarial vulnerability of video-based large language models (LLMs) and introduces a novel flow-based multi-modal attack, dubbed FMM-Attack, tailored for video-based LLMs. 

2) The observations on cross-modal feature attacks provide insights into multi-modal robustness and the critical alignment of safety-related features across modalities. This understanding is important for improving various large multi-modal models.

3) Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMM-Attack can effectively induce video-based LLMs to generate either garbled nonsensical sequences or incorrect semantic sequences with imperceptible perturbations added to less than 20% of the video frames.

In summary, the main contributions are: proposing the first video-based LLM attack method, providing insights into multi-modal robustness through cross-modal feature analysis, and experimentally showing the effectiveness of the FMM-Attack in misleading state-of-the-art video-based LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel flow-based multi-modal attack called FMM-Attack. What is the key idea behind using optical flow to select key frames for the attack? How does focusing the attack on these key frames improve effectiveness and efficiency?

2. The paper finds asymmetric transmission of features between the video modality and language modality, especially for garbled samples. What could be some reasons behind this asymmetric transmission? How can this observation inform future efforts in improving multi-modal feature alignment?

3. The FMM-Attack causes the models to generate two distinct types of incorrect outputs - garbled nonsensical sequences and incorrect semantic sequences. What differences in the attack strategy or model vulnerabilities could account for these two types of outputs? 

4. How exactly does the flow-based temporal masking work? Explain the algorithm and metrics used to select the key frames. What are some limitations of this approach?

5. The targeted version of the FMM-Attack optimizes the perturbation to make the output match a specific target video+text pair. Explain this objective function. What adaptations were required to make the attack targeted? 

6. The paper hypothesizes that the video feature extractor is more vulnerable as attacks on it transfer better across modalities. Test this hypothesis by comparing transfer rates of attacks focused on video vs language features.

7. One defense proposed is using compression or generative models to remove perturbations. Explain how these defenses could work and their limitations. What other defense strategies can you propose?  

8. The FMM-Attack is evaluated only in digital environments with pre-recorded videos. Discuss how the attack strategy would differ if deployed in physical environments with live video feeds.

9. Compare and contrast the FMM-Attack with other adversarial attacks proposed for visual-language models. What unique advantages and limitations exist? Can the techniques be combined?

10. The paper studies vulnerability of several model architectures by attacking them. Beyond accuracy metrics, what other analysis could yield further insight into model vulnerabilities? Propose experiments to test additional hypotheses.
