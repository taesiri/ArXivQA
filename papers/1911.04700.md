# [A Pre-training Based Personalized Dialogue Generation Model with   Persona-sparse Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04700)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we build personalized dialogue agents that can generate coherent and persona-consistent responses when only persona-sparse dialogue data is available for training?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a method to train personalized dialogue agents using persona-sparse real-world dialog data, where speakers don't intentionally reveal personas. This differs from prior work that uses persona-dense crowd-sourced data. 

- The proposed model uses a pre-trained language model, adds attribute embeddings to the encoder, and develops an attention routing mechanism in the decoder to dynamically control the amount of persona features to exhibit.

- Experiments show the model can produce more coherent and persona-consistent responses compared to baselines when fine-tuned on persona-sparse dialogues. The persona weighting can also be adjusted at test time.

In summary, the core research question is how to effectively leverage persona-sparse real-world dialog data to train personalized dialogue agents that can generate coherent responses with adjustable persona consistency. The key novelty is the dynamic integration of persona features using attention routing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a pre-training based personalized dialogue model that can generate coherent responses using persona-sparse dialogue data. Previous pre-training based methods require persona-dense data for fine-tuning, while this method can utilize the more readily available persona-sparse real-world dialogues. 

2. An attention routing mechanism is proposed in the decoder to dynamically incorporate the target persona. This allows balancing the contribution of the persona in the decoding process.

3. Experiments show the proposed model outperforms previous methods in generating more coherent and persona-consistent responses when fine-tuned on persona-sparse dialogues. The persona weight can also be adjusted to control the amount of persona features exhibited.

In summary, the key innovation is a pre-training based model that can effectively leverage persona-sparse dialogues for personalized response generation, enabled by the proposed attention routing mechanism. This provides a more practical solution for building personalized dialogue agents using real-world conversational data that are mostly persona-sparse.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a pre-training based personalized dialogue generation model that uses attribute embeddings and an attention routing mechanism to effectively incorporate persona information from sparse training data and generate coherent, persona-consistent responses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on personalized dialogue generation compares to other related work:

- Utilizes persona-sparse dialogue data: This paper focuses on making use of natural dialogues that only occasionally contain persona information (persona-sparse), as opposed to purpose-collected persona-dense datasets. This is more reflective of real-world dialogues.

- Pre-training language model: The method pre-trains a Transformer-based language model on a large text corpus before fine-tuning on the persona-sparse dialogues. This allows it to better leverage the available data. Other personalized dialogue models typically train from scratch.

- Explicit persona encoding: The model encodes the target speaker's persona attributes (e.g. gender, location) into explicit vector representations that augment the dialogue context encoding. This contrasts with implicit persona modeling.

- Attention routing with dynamic weighting: A novel attention routing mechanism is proposed to dynamically weight the persona vs dialogue context features used during decoding. This provides a way to balance context coherence and persona consistency.

- Evaluated on persona consistency specifically: In addition to standard dialogue metrics like fluency and coherence, automatic and human evaluations focus on quantifying how well the generated responses reflect the target persona.

Overall, the innovations around effectively utilizing persona-sparse data, dynamically balancing persona and context, and directly evaluating persona consistency appear to be some of the key contributions compared to prior personalized dialogue generation research. The results demonstrate improved persona consistency with comparable fluency and coherence.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Investigating other methods for modeling personas, such as using knowledge graphs or ontologies, to see if they can further improve persona consistency and coherence. 

- Exploring ways to incorporate more diverse and complex persona profiles beyond just gender, location, and interests. For example, incorporating personality traits, speaking style, opinions, etc.

- Evaluating the models on other persona-sparse datasets from different domains to test the generalizability.

- Evaluating the effects of different amounts of persona-sparse data on model performance during training.

- Exploring different inference methods beyond just tuning the persona weight, such as conditioning on explicity persona-related prompts.

- Applying the model to build personalized dialogue agents and evaluating them with real users through human-computer interactions.

- Extending the approach to other dialogue generation tasks that require persona modeling, such as conversational recommender systems.

- Investigating ethical issues related to persona modeling and personalization in dialogue systems.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring better ways to model diverse personas, evaluating on more datasets and tasks, testing in human-computer interactions, and investigating the ethical implications. The key is continuing to improve persona consistency and coherence in generated dialogues.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a pre-training based personalized dialogue generation model that can produce coherent responses conditioned on sparse persona data. The model uses a pre-trained language model to initialize an encoder-decoder framework. Attribute embeddings are added in the encoder to model speakers' personas when encoding dialogue histories. An attention routing mechanism is proposed in the decoder to incorporate the target persona dynamically during decoding. Specifically, the attention router contains three routes that extract features from the target persona, dialogue context, and previously decoded tokens, respectively. A dynamic weight predictor is trained to weigh the output of each route so that the contribution of the target persona can be balanced based on whether the training dialogue is persona-related or not. This allows the model to be trained in a unified manner on persona-sparse data while also controlling the amount of persona features to exhibit at test time. Experiments show the model can generate more coherent and persona-consistent responses compared to previous state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on persona-sparse data, as evaluated by both automatic metrics and human annotations. The attention router provides an effective way to leverage real-world persona-sparse dialogues that only occasionally reveal persona information.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a pre-training based personalized dialogue generation model that can produce coherent responses using persona-sparse dialogue data. The model uses a pre-trained language model to initialize an encoder and decoder. Personal attribute embeddings are added to the encoder to model speakers' personas together with dialogue histories. An attention routing mechanism is devised in the decoder to incorporate the target persona. Specifically, three attention routes are used to model features from the target persona, dialogue context, and previously decoded tokens. A dynamic weight predictor merges the output of each route using predicted weights, balancing the contribution of the target persona. 

The model can utilize persona-sparse dialogues during training and control the amount of persona features exhibited during inference. Experiments compare the model to baselines on automatic metrics like persona accuracy and BLEU, and manual evaluation of fluency, persona consistency, and context coherence. Results show the model outperforms baselines, generating more coherent and persona-consistent responses on both persona-sparse random test data and persona-dense biased test data. The attention routing mechanism and dynamic weighting are shown to be effective components. The persona weight can also be adjusted at inference time to control persona features exhibited.

The model uses a pre-trained language model to initialize an encoder and decoder. Personal attribute embeddings are added to the encoder to model speakers' personas together with dialogue histories. An attention routing mechanism is devised in the decoder to incorporate the target persona.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a pre-training based personalized dialogue model to generate coherent responses conditioned on sparsely available persona information. The model utilizes an encoder-decoder framework initialized with a pre-trained language model. Attribute embeddings are incorporated in the encoder to model speakers' personas when encoding dialogue histories. An attention routing mechanism with dynamic weighting is introduced in the decoder to control the contribution of persona features during decoding. Specifically, three attention routes are used to extract features from the target persona, dialogue context, and previously decoded tokens respectively. A neural network based weight predictor is jointly trained to predict the importance of incorporating persona features for each training sample. This allows effective utilization of persona-sparse dialogues and control over persona consistency during inference. Experiments on a large Chinese social media dataset demonstrate the model's ability to produce more persona-consistent and context-coherent responses compared to previous persona-based dialogue models that use pre-training or are trained from scratch. The proposed dynamic weighting scheme is shown to be more effective than heuristic weighting or directly fine-tuning on noisy persona-labeled data. Overall, the model provides an effective way to build personalized dialogue agents from real-world persona-sparse conversations by leveraging large scale pre-trained models.
