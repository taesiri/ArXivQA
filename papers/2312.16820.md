# [Catch Me if You Can: Effective Honeypot Placement in Dynamic AD Attack   Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies the problem of defending against attacks on Active Directory (AD) networks by strategically placing honeypots. 
- AD networks are used for access control in enterprises and are frequent targets of attacks. 
- Attackers build AD attack graphs to identify paths to reach high-value targets like Domain Admins.
- Defense is challenging due to the large size (100Ks of nodes, million edges) and dynamic nature of AD graphs.

Solution:
- The paper models the problem as a Stackelberg security game between an attacker and a defender.
- The defender places a limited number of honeypots on the AD graph to minimize the attacker's chances of reaching the target.  
- Two types of attackers are considered - simple attackers who always take the shortest path, and competent attackers who can identify honeypots.
- A mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation is proposed that can generate optimal defense strategies for very large static AD graphs.

Dynamic Graphs:
- The paper studies the defense problem on dynamic graphs for the first time.
- The MIP formulation is extended to handle multiple sampled instances of dynamic graphs.
- Two heuristics are proposed - voting-based and clustering-based - to scale the solution to large graph samples.

Contributions:  
- First paper to study honeypot placement on large dynamic AD graphs.
- MIP formulation to generate optimal defenses on very large (100K nodes) static graphs.  
- Defense strategies using graph sampling that are resilient to realistic edge dynamics.
- Voting and clustering heuristics that provide close to optimal solutions on large dynamic graphs.

The paper demonstrates the ability to strategically place honeypots for defending enterprise-scale dynamic AD networks against realistic attack scenarios.
