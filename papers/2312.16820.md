# [Catch Me if You Can: Effective Honeypot Placement in Dynamic AD Attack   Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies the problem of defending against attacks on Active Directory (AD) networks by strategically placing honeypots. 
- AD networks are used for access control in enterprises and are frequent targets of attacks. 
- Attackers build AD attack graphs to identify paths to reach high-value targets like Domain Admins.
- Defense is challenging due to the large size (100Ks of nodes, million edges) and dynamic nature of AD graphs.

Solution:
- The paper models the problem as a Stackelberg security game between an attacker and a defender.
- The defender places a limited number of honeypots on the AD graph to minimize the attacker's chances of reaching the target.  
- Two types of attackers are considered - simple attackers who always take the shortest path, and competent attackers who can identify honeypots.
- A mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation is proposed that can generate optimal defense strategies for very large static AD graphs.

Dynamic Graphs:
- The paper studies the defense problem on dynamic graphs for the first time.
- The MIP formulation is extended to handle multiple sampled instances of dynamic graphs.
- Two heuristics are proposed - voting-based and clustering-based - to scale the solution to large graph samples.

Contributions:  
- First paper to study honeypot placement on large dynamic AD graphs.
- MIP formulation to generate optimal defenses on very large (100K nodes) static graphs.  
- Defense strategies using graph sampling that are resilient to realistic edge dynamics.
- Voting and clustering heuristics that provide close to optimal solutions on large dynamic graphs.

The paper demonstrates the ability to strategically place honeypots for defending enterprise-scale dynamic AD networks against realistic attack scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the problem of optimally placing honeypots on nodes in large and dynamic Active Directory (AD) attack graphs to defend against attackers using mixed-integer programming and heuristics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors formulate a general honeypot placement problem in Active Directory (AD) attack graphs, considering two types of attackers - one that can detect honeypots and one that cannot. They show that even the static graph version of this problem is computationally hard.

2. They provide a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and solutions for placing honeypots in very large AD graphs. Their solution can handle graphs with around 100,000 nodes and 1 million edges, which is much larger than what prior approaches could handle.

3. They study the honeypot placement problem with dynamic graphs for the first time. Existing works focused only on static graphs. To handle the exponential number of possible graph instances in dynamic graphs, they develop two heuristics based on voting and clustering that allow their MIP algorithm to scale and produce near-optimal results.

4. Their experiments on synthetic and real dynamic AD graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed algorithms. The solutions provide close to optimal defense strategies while being robust to realistic temporal patterns in the graphs.

In summary, the key contribution is providing the first practical and scalable solutions for optimally placing honeypots in large and dynamic AD attack graphs against realistic attackers.

The paper focuses on the problem of optimally placing honeypots in large Active Directory attack graphs, in order to defend against both simple attackers (who cannot detect honeypots) and competent attackers (who can detect honeypots). It models the problem as a Stackelberg game between an attacker and a defender. The solutions proposed include mixed-integer programming formulations for both static and dynamic graphs, as well as voting-based and clustering-based heuristics to scale up the approach to large dynamic graphs. Key concepts include modeling attacker types, dealing with graph dynamics, and developing computationally feasible solutions that remain close to optimal. The keywords and terms reflect this problem space and the techniques used in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper considers two types of attackers - simple and competent. What are the key differences in how these attackers behave and how does the defense strategy need to adapt for each type?

2. Explain the mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation proposed to solve the honeypot allocation problem. What are the key decision variables and constraints that capture the essence of the problem? 

3. For dynamic graphs, the paper proposes a multi-graph MIP formulation. Explain how this extends the MIP for static graphs. What additional complexities arise in the dynamic graph setting?

4. Two heuristics are proposed for scaling the multi-graph MIP to large collections of graph samples - voting-based and clustering-based. Contrast these two approaches. What are the tradeoffs between them?

5. The clustering-based heuristic uses k-means to cluster graph instances. Explain the process of feature extraction from graphs and how the cluster centroids are leveraged to pick representative graphs.

6. How is the lower bound on the optimal blocking strategy for dynamic graphs derived? Explain the batching approach and how summation of batch optimal values leads to a lower bound.

7. Real AD networks exhibit temporal patterns in user sessions rather than completely random patterns. How do the experiments account for real session properties like correlations and new connections? 

8. The competent attacker aims to maximize reachability to the Domain Admin node. How is this captured in the constraints of the MIP formulation?

9. For the simple attacker model, the paper assumes the attacker takes one of the shortest paths. Does this fully characterize real simple attackers? Could enhancements be made?

10. The results show high correlation between number of online sessions and attacker success rate. Why does this correlation exist? How can the defense strategy be adapted to handle periods of high activity?
