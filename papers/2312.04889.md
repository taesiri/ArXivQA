# [KwaiAgents: Generalized Information-seeking Agent System with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04889)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes KwaiAgents, an information-seeking agent system powered by large language models (LLMs). It has three main components: KAgentSys, an autonomous agent loop integrating memory, tools, planning, and concluding; KAgentLMs, a suite of open-source LLMs trained using Meta-Agent Tuning (MAT) to enhance agent capabilities; and KAgentBench, a benchmark for automatically and comprehensively assessing different LLMs on varied agent abilities. 

KAgentSys employs a planning-concluding procedure with an innovative hybrid search-browse and time-aware toolkit to address queries effectively. MAT helps smaller open-sourced LLMs acquire generalized agent skills like planning and tool usage. It crafts diverse prompt templates for agents through a meta-agent, then generates agent instruction data and fine-tunes models. KAgentBench enables streamlined evaluation across planning, tool usage, reflection, role-playing, etc. Through extensive experiments, KAgentSys outperforms existing systems while even 7B-13B models exhibit strong capabilities after MAT, nearing GPT-4's performance. The paper's comprehensive contributions should facilitate more research into LLM-based agents.
