# [Learning a 3D Morphable Face Reflectance Model from Low-cost Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11686)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF and a technique to train it using low-cost publicly-available data. The key research questions it aims to address are:

1) How to represent spatially varying facial reflectance including diffuse albedo and specular effects in a morphable model framework?

2) How to estimate the parameters of such a reflectance model from images captured under uncontrolled illumination, without requiring specialized equipment like a light stage? 

3) How to learn a statistical model of facial reflectance from a limited dataset like Multi-PIE and improve its generalization capability using a large in-the-wild facial image dataset?

The main hypothesis is that by using a combination of Lambertian and Blinn-Phong BRDFs with a novel linear weighting formulation, it is possible to represent spatially varying facial reflectance in a morphable model. The parameters of this model can be estimated from regular face images via inverse rendering. Then the model can be initialized on a small dataset and further improved by joint face reconstruction and model finetuning on a large in-the-wild dataset.

In summary, this paper focuses on building the first 3D morphable face model that represents spatially varying reflectance using only publicly available datasets, not specialized controlled capture setups. The key innovations are in the reflectance representation and the proposed techniques for model training and finetuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing the first 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF, using only low-cost publicly-available data. 

- Applying linear shiness weighting into parametric modeling to represent spatially varying specular shiness and intensity, which eases the process of reconstructing reflectance from images.

- Proposing an update-by-reconstruction strategy to finetune the face reflectance model on an in-the-wild dataset, improving its generalization capability and expressive power.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a technique to train a morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying non-Lambertian effects from low-cost data, without requiring expensive setups like Light Stages. The proposed linear shiness weighting representation and model finetuning strategy are key enablers for this.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes the first 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF trained on low-cost publicly available data, representing face reflectance as a combination of a Lambertian term and a linear blend of Blinn-Phong lobes to model varying specular intensity and shininess across the face.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents the first 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF trained from low-cost publicly-available data. Here are some key comparisons to other related works:

- Compared to traditional 3DMMs like BFM and FLAME which only model Lambertian reflectance, this paper incorporates a non-Lambertian BRDF to represent facial specularity. This leads to more realistic face rendering results. 

- Compared to recent works like AlbedoMM and SfSNet which build parametric models for diffuse and specular albedo using Light Stage data, this paper defines a complete BRDF using linear shininess weighting. It does not require Light Stage data and can represent spatially varying specular shininess.

- Compared to works using a global specular exponent for the whole face, this method models specularity in a spatially varying manner. This avoids artifacts like over-shininess around the cheek.

- Compared to image-based face appearance capture like Neural Reflectance Fields, this method outputs an explicit 3D morphable model that disentangles geometry and reflectance. The model supports editing and animation.

- Compared to model-based methods requiring complex setups, this method requires only simple data like flash images and room-lit images. The proposed inverse rendering approach works on such low-cost data.

- Compared to methods that require multi-view data, this method learns the model from single-view images by leveraging a model-based optimization strategy.

In summary, this paper pushes forward 3D morphable face modeling to handle non-Lambertian effects using only simple data. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in representing spatially varying face reflectance across the population. The model training framework is also novel and practical.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Integrating a more sophisticated reflectance model into their morphable face reflectance model to improve rendering realism, such as a model that can represent subsurface scattering.

- Improving the modeling of specularities around the eyes, which their current BRDF representation struggles with. They suggest the limitations may be due to inaccurate eye geometry reconstruction and the inability of their BRDF model to handle complex refractive effects of eyes.

- Using a differentiable ray tracer during model finetuning instead of a rasterizer to better handle global illumination effects like shadows and interreflections.

- Leveraging multi-view in-the-wild datasets or videos during model finetuning to further improve face reconstruction, as has been shown in prior work. 

- Addressing the inevitable global scale ambiguity between the estimated reflectance parameters and ground truth, which is a fundamental limitation when learning from low-cost datasets without known lighting.

- Overall, the authors suggest directions to enhance their model with more sophisticated reflectance and rendering techniques, leverage additional data sources, and handle inherent ambiguities in reflectance estimation. Their framework provides a strong foundation for future work to build upon.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points:

This paper proposes the first 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF trained on low-cost publicly-available data. The model represents face reflectance as a combination of a Lambertian term and a linear combination of Blinn-Phong BRDFs to capture diffuse and specular properties. An inverse rendering approach is used to estimate reflectance parameters on Multi-PIE data to train an initial model. To improve generalization, the model is finetuned on FFHQ data using an update-by-reconstruction strategy that jointly optimizes a face reconstruction network and the model parameters. Experiments demonstrate the approach can represent spatially varying intensity and shininess to achieve realistic rendering. The method requires only low-cost data rather than specialized Light Stage scans.
