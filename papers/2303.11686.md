# [Learning a 3D Morphable Face Reflectance Model from Low-cost Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11686)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF and a technique to train it using low-cost publicly-available data. The key research questions it aims to address are:

1) How to represent spatially varying facial reflectance including diffuse albedo and specular effects in a morphable model framework?

2) How to estimate the parameters of such a reflectance model from images captured under uncontrolled illumination, without requiring specialized equipment like a light stage? 

3) How to learn a statistical model of facial reflectance from a limited dataset like Multi-PIE and improve its generalization capability using a large in-the-wild facial image dataset?

The main hypothesis is that by using a combination of Lambertian and Blinn-Phong BRDFs with a novel linear weighting formulation, it is possible to represent spatially varying facial reflectance in a morphable model. The parameters of this model can be estimated from regular face images via inverse rendering. Then the model can be initialized on a small dataset and further improved by joint face reconstruction and model finetuning on a large in-the-wild dataset.

In summary, this paper focuses on building the first 3D morphable face model that represents spatially varying reflectance using only publicly available datasets, not specialized controlled capture setups. The key innovations are in the reflectance representation and the proposed techniques for model training and finetuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing the first 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF, using only low-cost publicly-available data. 

- Applying linear shiness weighting into parametric modeling to represent spatially varying specular shiness and intensity, which eases the process of reconstructing reflectance from images.

- Proposing an update-by-reconstruction strategy to finetune the face reflectance model on an in-the-wild dataset, improving its generalization capability and expressive power.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a technique to train a morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying non-Lambertian effects from low-cost data, without requiring expensive setups like Light Stages. The proposed linear shiness weighting representation and model finetuning strategy are key enablers for this.
