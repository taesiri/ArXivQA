# [Conformalized Selective Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16300)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Predictive models face critical issues of reliability and fairness due to the problem of uncertainty. Inaccurate predictions in domains like healthcare, education, and finance can have high costs. 
- Existing selective regression models rely on distribution-based proxies like conditional variance to measure uncertainty. However, these ignore model-specific biases which lead to overconfidence in predictions.  
- There is also no standardized evaluation approach to assess the trade-off between prediction performance and rejection rates. Commonly used AUC metrics are inappropriate.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Conformalized Selective Regression (CSR), which leverages conformal prediction to provide model-specific confidence measures. This accounts for model biases.
- CSR uses the conformalized interval width, adjusted by calibration, as the uncertainty measure to decide when to reject predictions. This adapts to data heterogeneity.
- For evaluation, a normalized MSE is proposed to compare models based on their ability to balance error rates and coverage. The distance from the ideal point of zero error and full coverage is measured.

Key Contributions:
- A selective regression framework called CSR that uses conformal prediction to enhance reliability and coverage of predictions.
- A standardized evaluation methodology for selective regression models focused on finding the optimal trade-off between predictive performance and coverage.
- Empirical demonstration across datasets showing CSR variants outperform state-of-the-art selective regression baselines in balancing errors and coverage.
- Addresses critical gaps in existing literature on role of model biases and lack of grounded evaluation approaches for selective regression.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards developing selective regression models that can better express uncertainty and make more reliable predictions in real-world deployment.
