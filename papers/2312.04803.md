# [SuperNormal: Neural Surface Reconstruction via Multi-View Normal   Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04803)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents SuperNormal, a fast and accurate neural approach for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D geometry from multi-view surface normal maps. The method represents the 3D shape as a neural signed distance function (SDF) powered by multi-resolution hash encoding to enable detailed geometry recovery. To accelerate training, the authors propose a tailored strategy called directional finite difference and patch-based ray marching to approximate SDF gradients by reusing the same SDF evaluations needed for volume rendering. This avoids inefficient double backpropagation and reduces redundant SDF computations. Experiments show SuperNormal produces geometrically accurate reconstructions on par with 3D scanners in under a minute, nearly two times faster than using analytical gradients and three times faster than axis-aligned finite difference. Qualitative results on complex real-world objects demonstrate SuperNormal recovers finer surface details compared to recent neural 3D reconstruction approaches that use only color images. By exploiting photometric stereo to obtain high-quality normal maps, the method provides a promising direction for accessible high-fidelity 3D scanning using commodity hardware.
