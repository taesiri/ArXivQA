# [SuperNormal: Neural Surface Reconstruction via Multi-View Normal   Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04803)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents SuperNormal, a fast and accurate neural approach for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D geometry from multi-view surface normal maps. The method represents the 3D shape as a neural signed distance function (SDF) powered by multi-resolution hash encoding to enable detailed geometry recovery. To accelerate training, the authors propose a tailored strategy called directional finite difference and patch-based ray marching to approximate SDF gradients by reusing the same SDF evaluations needed for volume rendering. This avoids inefficient double backpropagation and reduces redundant SDF computations. Experiments show SuperNormal produces geometrically accurate reconstructions on par with 3D scanners in under a minute, nearly two times faster than using analytical gradients and three times faster than axis-aligned finite difference. Qualitative results on complex real-world objects demonstrate SuperNormal recovers finer surface details compared to recent neural 3D reconstruction approaches that use only color images. By exploiting photometric stereo to obtain high-quality normal maps, the method provides a promising direction for accessible high-fidelity 3D scanning using commodity hardware.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing high-quality 3D geometry of real-world objects from multi-view images is challenging. Neural implicit surface methods can be robust and efficient but tend to oversmooth fine surface details. Multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) aims to recover pixel-level detail using images under varying lighting, but existing fusion methods fail to reflect input normal map details in the final shape. Moreover, MVPS reconstruction takes hours even for low-resolution inputs. There is a need for a fast and accurate approach to fuse multi-view normal maps into high-fidelity surfaces.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents SuperNormal, a method to optimize a neural signed distance function (SDF) from multi-view normal maps for fast and detailed reconstruction. It introduces directional finite difference and patch-based ray marching to reuse SDF evaluations for both volume rendering and efficient numerical SDF gradient approximation. This avoids analytical gradient computation and speeds up training. Multi-resolution hash encoding is used to represent complex geometry. The SDF is optimized using a loss enforcing consistency between rendered and input normal maps and silhouettes.  

Main Contributions:
- Effective combination of multi-view normal maps, expressive neural SDF and volume rendering for high quality reconstruction 
- Directional finite difference for approximating SDF gradients by reusing samples, avoiding analytical gradients and accelerating training
- Patch-based ray marching to obtain samples for both rendering and gradients
- Demonstration of reconstruction quality on par with 3D scanners at much faster speed than existing MVPS methods
- Ability to capture complex geometries using casual equipment and lighting  

The method produces high-fidelity geometry from normal maps in just minutes, surpassing other neural MVPS techniques in quality and speed. Recovered details surpass recent neural reconstruction methods and approach scanner quality. The use of photometric stereo and efficient learning paves the way for accessible high-quality scanning.
