# [Exploring Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Consistent Label Associations   for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person ReID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) aims to retrieve pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities without any identity annotations. Existing methods have focused on establishing cross-modality pseudo-label associations to bridge the modality gap. However, they overlook maintaining homogeneous (within-modality) and heterogeneous (cross-modality) consistency in the pseudo-label space, resulting in coarse associations.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Modality-Unified Label Transfer (MULT) module to generate high-quality pseudo-label associations that preserve both homogeneous and heterogeneous structures. Specifically:

1. MULT models instance-level homogeneous (within-modality) and heterogeneous (cross-modality) affinities based on feature similarities. 

2. These affinities are used to define inconsistency losses to minimize within-modality variations and cross-modality misalignments of pseudo-labels during an affinity-guided label transfer process.

3. This allows each instance to communicate label information with both within-modality and cross-modality counterparts, ensuring consistency.

Additionally, an Online Cross-memory Label Refinement (OCLR) is proposed to further mitigate noisy labels while reducing the modality gap by enforcing prediction consistency between intra-modality and cross-modality memory banks. 

Main Contributions:

1. Proposes MULT module that provides homogeneous and heterogeneous structurally consistent cross-modality pseudo-label associations by modeling instance-level relationships.

2. Designs a straightforward OCLR module to alleviate noisy labels and align modalities by online cross-memory prediction consistency.

3. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed MULT and OCLR modules.

In summary, the key novelty is generating high-quality pseudo-labels for USL-VI-ReID by considering both within-modality and cross-modality instance-level relationships to preserve structural consistency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Modality-Unified Label Transfer module and an Online Cross-memory Label Refinement module to establish reliable cross-modality pseudo-label associations and align heterogeneous modalities for unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a Modality-Unified Label Transfer (MULT) module that considers instance-level context structures to provide homogeneous and heterogeneous structurally consistent cross-modality pseudo-label associations for network training.

2. Designing a straightforward plug-and-play Online Cross-memory Label Refinement (OCLR) module for learning cross-memory self-consistency online, alleviating the impact of noisy labels while mitigating the modality gap.

3. Conducting experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets that demonstrate the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised VI-ReID methods, and the MULT module generates higher-quality label associations than other methods.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) the MULT module for structurally consistent cross-modality pseudo-label associations, (2) the plug-and-play OCLR module for online label refinement, and (3) experimental validation of the proposed methods against state-of-the-art approaches.
