# [Exploring Hybrid Question Answering via Program-based Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Hybrid question answering (HQA) requires reasoning over diverse data sources like tables, texts, and images, which is challenging due to large scale of information and coupling of heterogeneous data.
- Existing methods rely on training specialized retrievers to reduce input length or transforming data modalities to simplify the task, but have limitations in applicability and risk losing information. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes HProPro, a novel program-based prompting framework for HQA that follows a code generation and execution paradigm. 
- It integrates Function Declaration and Function Implementation to define customized functions for handling heterogeneous data, avoiding the need for specialized retrievers or modal transformations.
- Functions like "extract_info" and "check" are declared, then implemented to enable extracting information directly from tables, texts, images without converting modalities.

Main Contributions:
- First work to explore reasoning over heterogeneous data for HQA without requiring domain-specific retrieval or modal transformation
- Achieves state-of-the-art results under few-shot setting on HybridQA and all settings on MultiModalQA benchmarks
- Eliminates reliance on data distribution through program-based solution, providing more flexibility and scalability compared to existing specialized models

In summary, the paper puts forth HProPro, a novel program-based prompting approach to HQA that leverages language models' coding capabilities to reason over diverse data sources without modal conversion. By declaring and implementing custom functions, it extracts information directly from heterogeneous data, achieving excellent performance while maintaining generalizability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes HProPro, a novel program-based prompting framework for hybrid question answering that integrates function declaration and implementation to perform reasoning over heterogeneous data sources like tables, text, and images without needing domain-specific retrievers or modal transformations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing HProPro, a novel program-based prompting framework for hybrid question answering (HQA) that enables reasoning over heterogeneous data without requiring domain-specific retrieval or modal transformation. 

2. Implementing a few-shot code generation and execution pipeline, calling various functions through function declaration and implementation to perform information-seeking across data from different sources and modalities.

3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of HProPro through experiments, where it achieves the best performances under the few-shot settings on two HQA benchmarks HybridQA and MultiModalQA, outperforming previous methods.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a flexible and generalizable program-based prompting approach for HQA that can handle reasoning over diverse data sources without reliance on task-specific components.
