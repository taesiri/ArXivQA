## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reconstructing 3D scenes and novel view synthesis from extremely sparse multi-view images is an important and challenging task. Prior works like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) tend to be slow due to expensive volumetric sampling during rendering. Recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods are more efficient but existing feed-forward 3DGS models either focus on single object reconstruction from a single image or produce low quality geometry for general scenes.

Method: 
This paper proposes MVSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3DGS model that achieves high-quality reconstruction and rendering of general scenes from sparse multi-view images. The key idea is to build a cost volume to store cross-view feature similarities which provides valuable cues for localizing 3D surfaces. This formulation as a feature matching problem reduces the task difficulty and enables lightweight design. 

Specifically, per-view cost volumes are constructed by plane sweeping and correlating features across views. They are refined by a UNet with cross-view attention. Depth maps are predicted using the refined cost volumes and unprojected to obtain 3D Gaussian centers. Other Gaussian properties like opacity and color are predicted in parallel. The model is trained end-to-end with just a rendering loss.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes constructing cost volumes to exploit cross-view similarities for high quality feed-forward 3DGS learning from sparse views 
- Achieves state-of-the-art on RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks with fastest feed-forward speed (22 fps)
- Uses 10x fewer parameters and 2x faster inference than current state-of-the-art pixelSplat while attaining higher quality
- Generalizes better to unseen distributions demonstrating effectiveness of feature matching formulation

In summary, this paper presents an efficient and lightweight feed-forward 3DGS model for high quality scene reconstruction from sparse views. The core idea of leveraging cost volumes sets a new state-of-the-art for the task.
