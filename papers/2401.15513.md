# [MiTU-Net: A fine-tuned U-Net with SegFormer backbone for segmenting   pubic symphysis-fetal head](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15513)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of manually measuring the angle of progression (AoP) from ultrasound images during labor, which is time-consuming, cumbersome, and prone to errors. The AoP is defined as the angle between the pubic symphysis and fetal head, and is used to assess labor progression. Accurately segmenting the fetal head and pubic symphysis from ultrasound images is an essential first step for automated AoP measurement.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a neural network called MiTU-Net for automatic segmentation of the fetal head and pubic symphysis. MiTU-Net is based on a U-Net architecture with a Mix Transformer encoder. The Mix Transformer encoder enhances feature representation through attention mechanisms while reducing computational cost. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of 4000 ultrasound images. Data augmentation and losses including binary cross-entropy and Jaccard index are used during training.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes MiTU-Net architecture combining U-Net and Mix Transformer to efficiently segment ultrasound images
- Achieves competitive dice similarity scores of 0.9313 and 0.8580 for fetal head and pubic symphysis segmentation 
- Ranked 5th out of methods submitted to a segmentation challenge, demonstrating effectiveness
- Provides framework to automate the fetal head and pubic symphysis segmentation required for AoP measurement
- Reduces trainable parameters from 31 million to 5 million compared to traditional U-Net through Mix Transformer encoder

The proposed MiTU-Net offers an efficient deep learning solution to automatically segment structures from ultrasound for automated obstetric measurements, helping improve clinical workflows.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Mix Transformer U-Net (MiTU-Net) model for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from ultrasound images to enable automated measurement of the angle of progression.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper content, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new deep learning model called MiTU-Net for automatic segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from ultrasound images. Specifically:

- The MiTU-Net model is based on a U-Net architecture with a Mix Transformer encoder that enhances feature representation while reducing computational cost and memory usage. 

- The Mix Transformer encoder leverages attention mechanisms to select and process only the important parts of the input image.

- This allows reducing the number of trainable parameters from 31 million in the original U-Net to only 5 million in the proposed MiTU-Net.

- The effectiveness of MiTU-Net is demonstrated through experiments on a dataset of transperineal ultrasound images, where it achieves competitive performance in segmenting the fetal head and pubic symphysis.

- The accurate segmentation enables automated measurement of the angle of progression, which is useful for assessing labor progression. This can assist sonographers and reduce errors.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of an efficient deep learning model for automatic semantic segmentation of ultrasound images, enabling accurate automated measurement of anatomical parameters. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational requirements.
