# [Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can visual attention in image captioning and visual question answering be improved by using a combined bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism that enables attention at the level of objects and salient image regions?

The key hypothesis appears to be that calculating attention based on object proposals from a region proposal network like Faster R-CNN, rather than grid locations, will lead to better performance in image captioning and VQA tasks.

The authors propose a model that combines bottom-up attention based on Faster R-CNN with top-down attention based on the language context. They evaluate this on image captioning using the MSCOCO dataset and on VQA using the VQA v2.0 dataset. 

The main results seem to support their hypothesis, showing significant gains over baseline models on various image captioning and VQA metrics when using the combined bottom-up and top-down attention approach. This establishes a new state-of-the-art for both tasks.

In summary, the key research question is whether object-level bottom-up attention can improve performance in image captioning and VQA when combined with top-down attention, which the results generally confirm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a combined bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism for image captioning and visual question answering. The bottom-up mechanism proposes image regions using Faster R-CNN, while the top-down mechanism determines feature weightings.

- Achieving new state-of-the-art results on MSCOCO image captioning by incorporating this attention mechanism, with CIDEr/SPICE/BLEU-4 scores of 117.9, 21.5 and 36.9.

- Applying the same attention approach to visual question answering and obtaining first place in the 2017 VQA Challenge, with 70.3% overall accuracy on the VQA v2 test server.

- Demonstrating qualitatively that the combined attention approach enables focusing on both fine details and large salient regions, overcoming limitations of grid-based attention mechanisms.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing the combined bottom-up and top-down attention approach for vision-language tasks, and showing it achieves improved results and interpretability on image captioning and VQA.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in image captioning and visual question answering:

- The main novelty is the combined bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism for attending to salient image regions. Most prior work uses only top-down attention based on convolutional features. Using object detectors to propose regions is a more natural approach.

- For image captioning, their model achieves state-of-the-art results on MSCOCO, outperforming prior work like SCST. The gains are attributed to the bottom-up attention.

- For VQA, their approach also achieves state-of-the-art on the VQA 2.0 benchmark, demonstrating the broad applicability of their method.

- Their bottom-up attention is based on Faster R-CNN, which is a standard object detection model. Some prior work used other region proposal methods like selective search. Leveraging advances in object detection is a strength.

- Both the image captioning and VQA models are relatively simple encoder-decoder architectures with attention. The gains come from the bottom-up attention features rather than model architecture.

- They compare several baselines including different CNN encoders and attention sizes. The results demonstrate the benefits of attending to object-like regions.

- Qualitative examples show their model attends to fine details and large salient regions without compromising between scales. This highlights the advantages of object-level attention.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of bottom-up object detection with top-down attention for captioning and VQA. Their strong results validate the benefits of attending to objects and salient regions compared to grid-based approaches. The simple model architectures help isolate these gains. Overall, it represents an important advance in attention mechanisms for vision and language tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests the following future research directions:

- Extending the bottom-up attention model to incorporate stronger top-down context. The current approach only uses task-specific context to determine feature weightings. Providing additional context during the region proposal stage could further improve results.

- Applying the bottom-up and top-down attention framework to other multimodal tasks like visual dialog and embodied question answering. The general methodology could be beneficial in other settings that require reasoning about visual scenes. 

- Exploring different region proposal architectures as the bottom-up attention mechanism. For example, using region proposal networks with a greater number of smaller proposals.

- Incorporating features from object detectors pretrained on datasets larger than Visual Genome, such as the full OpenImages dataset.

- Investigating whether end-to-end training of the region proposal network together with downstream captioning/VQA models can provide further gains.

In summary, the main future direction is generalizing and scaling up the combined bottom-up and top-down attention approach to additional tasks and datasets. There are also opportunities to explore refinements to the region proposal architecture used for bottom-up attention.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a combined bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism for image captioning and visual question answering. The bottom-up mechanism uses Faster R-CNN to propose salient image regions, represented as bounding boxes with feature vectors. The top-down mechanism uses task-specific context, like a partial caption or question, to predict attention distributions over the proposed regions. For image captioning, the model takes multiple glimpses of image regions while generating the caption, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MSCOCO dataset. For visual question answering, the same approach also achieves state-of-the-art results on the VQA v2.0 dataset, demonstrating the broad applicability of the method. By enabling attention at the level of objects and salient regions, the approach improves performance while also providing more interpretable attention weights compared to applying attention uniformly over spatial grid locations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a combined bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism for image captioning and visual question answering. The bottom-up mechanism uses Faster R-CNN to generate object proposals from the image, providing a set of salient image regions. The top-down mechanism then uses an LSTM model to predict attention over these regions based on language context. 

The proposed approach is evaluated on image captioning using the MSCOCO dataset and on visual question answering using the VQA v2.0 dataset. For image captioning, the inclusion of bottom-up attention leads to improved results across all metrics compared to baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MSCOCO test server. For visual question answering, the approach achieves first place in the 2017 VQA Challenge. The paper demonstrates that calculating attention at the level of objects and salient image regions improves performance and interpretability in vision-language tasks. Overall, the work provides a strong unification between object detection and multimodal understanding.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a combined bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism for image captioning and visual question answering. The bottom-up mechanism is based on Faster R-CNN, which generates region proposals corresponding to salient image regions. Each region is represented by a pooled convolutional feature vector. The top-down mechanism takes the image regions from the bottom-up attention and applies task-specific context, like a partial caption or question encoding, to predict attention weights over the regions. The attended feature vector is computed as a weighted average of the region vectors based on the attention distribution. This allows fine-grained attention at the object level. The method is evaluated on image captioning using an LSTM model with the attended vector as input, establishing a new state-of-the-art on MSCOCO. It is also applied to visual question answering with a VQA model, again using the attended vector as input, achieving first place in the 2017 VQA Challenge. The main novelty is the combined bottom-up region proposal attention with standard top-down soft attention mechanisms.
