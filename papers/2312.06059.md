# [CONFORM: Contrast is All You Need For High-Fidelity Text-to-Image   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06059)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes CONFORM, a novel training-free approach that utilizes a contrastive objective and test-time optimization to enhance the fidelity of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and Imagen. CONFORM tackles common issues with text-to-image generation including missing objects, misaligned attributes, and inaccurate object counts by encouraging attention map segregation between distinct objects while clustering related attributes. Specifically, it treats attributes of a given object as positive pairs while contrasting them against attributes and objects outside that pairing. Experiments across various benchmarks and user studies demonstrate CONFORM's ability to produce images more faithful to input prompts than current state-of-the-art methods. The method is model-agnostic, working effectively with both latent and pixel-based diffusion models. Key results highlight superiority over competing approaches in quantitative metrics like text-image similarity, text-text similarity using captioning, and newly proposed TIFA scores. In conclusion, CONFORM offers an intuitive yet highly versatile approach to enhance text-to-image generation through test-time optimization grounded in contrastive learning.
