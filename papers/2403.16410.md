# [Spike-NeRF: Neural Radiance Field Based On Spike Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Standard neural radiance fields (NeRFs) perform poorly on high-speed dynamic scenes due to motion blur in the input images captured by traditional cameras. Neuromorphic cameras like spike cameras can capture high temporal resolution data but it is challenging to build NeRFs from sparse, noisy spike streams.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Spike-NeRF, the first neural radiance field reconstructed from spike camera data, for novel view synthesis of high-speed scenes. The key ideas are:

1) Instead of multi-view images at the same time instant used by NeRF, Spike-NeRF takes continuous spike streams from a moving spike camera over a very short time as input.  

2) A spiking volume renderer is proposed to generate spike streams for novel views based on the spike camera's coding method and volume rendering.

3) Spike masks are used to focus NeRF learning on triggered spike areas and reduce artifacts. 

4) A spike loss term is added to the training loss to reduce local blurring.

Main Contributions:

1) First approach to infer NeRF model from spike streams for high quality novel view synthesis of high-speed scenes, in both grayscale and RGB.

2) Bespoke spike-based rendering method leading to efficient training and spike stream generation.

3) Introduction of spike masks and loss for stable NeRF reconstruction from noisy, information lacking spike data.

4) Collection and release of RGB spike streams paired with 40,000 fps camera poses.

The method is evaluated on synthetic Blender scenes and shows superiority over NeRF methods designed for traditional cameras as well as using reconstructed images from spikes as supervision. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the advantages.
