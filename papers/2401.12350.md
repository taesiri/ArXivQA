# [Scaling Up Quantization-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Efficient   Deep Learning on the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Designing accurate and efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) for resource-constrained edge devices is challenging. Neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a solution, but models need to be quantized for deployment which often degrades accuracy. 
- Quantization-aware NAS (QA-NAS) has been proposed to search for accurate quantized models, but existing approaches don't scale to large tasks and focus only on small networks.
- Especially joint search for architectures and mixed-precision quantization policies is compute-intensive and doesn't scale.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce quantization awareness into Block-WISE NAS (BWNAS) to scale QA-NAS to larger tasks. 
- Leverage BWNAS formulation to divide supernet into blocks to reduce search space and allow better optimization of subnets.
- Quantize and evaluate subnets in each block to create look-up tables (LUTs). Jointly search architecture and quantization policy using LUTs.
- Optimize search algorithm to only explore Pareto optimal solutions, reducing search from hours to seconds.

Contributions:
- Advance state-of-the-art by introducing quantization awareness into BWNAS for both INT8 and mixed-precision quantization.
- Show approach scales QA-NAS to large task of semantic segmentation on Cityscapes dataset.
- Find mixed-precision models 33% smaller without loss of accuracy compared to INT8 models.
- Optimize search algorithm to reduce search cost from hours to seconds by only exploring Pareto optimal solutions.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective approach to scale quantization-aware NAS to larger tasks by building upon Block-WISE NAS. Both INT8 and mixed-precision NAS models for semantic segmentation are demonstrated. The optimized search algorithm also reduces search time substantially.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents an approach to scale quantization-aware neural architecture search to large tasks like semantic segmentation by efficiently introducing quantization awareness into the block-wise formulation of block-wise NAS.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting an approach to scale quantization-aware neural architecture search (QA-NAS) by efficiently introducing quantization awareness into block-wise NAS (BWNAS). Specifically, the authors:

1) Introduce quantization-awareness into BWNAS (QA-BWNAS), developing a simple and effective approach to derive optimal INT8 and few-bit mixed-precision (FB-MP) models for semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset.

2) Empirically show that their method is suitable for scaling QA-NAS up to large-scale and compute-intensive tasks like semantic segmentation, especially for FB-MP quantization. 

3) Present an optimized version of the traversal search algorithm from DNA that reduces the search cost from several hours to only a few seconds.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the state-of-the-art in QA-NAS by proposing an approach to efficiently scale it to larger and more complex tasks through integrating quantization-awareness into the BWNAS framework.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a quantization-aware block-wise NAS (QA-BWNAS) method. How does introducing quantization awareness into the existing block-wise NAS framework help in finding better quantized models compared to simply quantizing models post-search?

2. The paper argues that existing quantization-aware NAS approaches do not scale well, especially for few-bit mixed precision search. What modifications does QA-BWNAS make to the block-wise formulation that allows it to scale better compared to prior works?

3. The paper uses post-training quantization instead of quantization-aware fine-tuning when evaluating candidate subnets. What is the motivation behind this design choice? What are the tradeoffs?

4. The paper introduces an optimization to accelerate the search process by first deriving Pareto optimal solutions per block and pruning suboptimal solutions. Explain this optimization and why it leads to reduced search times. 

5. The experimental results show QA-BWNAS finding student models that outperform the teacher model in both full and low precision settings. Why does this occur, and how does it relate to the block-wise training procedure?

6. Analyze the differences between the search spaces used for FB-MP search versus INT8 search. What additional considerations need to be made when constructing the search space for FB-MP?

7. The paper demonstrates promising results on Cityscapes semantic segmentation. What modifications would be required to apply QA-BWNAS to other tasks like image classification or object detection?

8. How does the compute cost of QA-BWNAS compare to extending existing weight sharing NAS methods for quantization awareness? Where are the major differences?

9. The paper only searches the encoder part of the segmentation network. What benefits or disadvantages might there be in searching the decoder components as well?

10. How well do you expect the QA-BWNAS approach to generalize to hardware platforms other than the i.MX8M Plus used in the paper? Would the search process need to be modified?
