# [Apollo's Oracle: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning in Multi-Agent Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04854)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multi-agent debate framework called MADRA that incorporates retrieval of prior knowledge to enhance reasoning capabilities. The framework is structured around three key roles - debaters, judge, and summarizer. Before presenting their views, debaters select relevant evidence from a pool created by retrieving passages from Wikipedia and Google search results. This allows breaking cognitive constraints, where agents adhere to incorrect viewpoints or abandon correct ones. The debate process has three stages - simultaneous talk, orderly talk, and summary. After each orderly talk round, the judge decides if a consensus is reached to conclude the debate. Finally, the summarizer compiles the final answer. The paper also introduces a self-selection method for debaters to choose helpful evidence themselves, minimizing irrelevant data impact. Experiments on reasoning and fact verification datasets demonstrate MADRA's superior performance over baselines. Ablations validate the efficacy of its debate framework, evidence retrieval, self-selection, and hyperparameter choices. Thus, MADRA effectively enhances multi-agent debate performance for complex reasoning via retrieval augmentation.
