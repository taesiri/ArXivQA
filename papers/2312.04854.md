# [Apollo's Oracle: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning in Multi-Agent Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04854)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multi-agent debate framework called MADRA that incorporates retrieval of prior knowledge to enhance reasoning capabilities. The framework is structured around three key roles - debaters, judge, and summarizer. Before presenting their views, debaters select relevant evidence from a pool created by retrieving passages from Wikipedia and Google search results. This allows breaking cognitive constraints, where agents adhere to incorrect viewpoints or abandon correct ones. The debate process has three stages - simultaneous talk, orderly talk, and summary. After each orderly talk round, the judge decides if a consensus is reached to conclude the debate. Finally, the summarizer compiles the final answer. The paper also introduces a self-selection method for debaters to choose helpful evidence themselves, minimizing irrelevant data impact. Experiments on reasoning and fact verification datasets demonstrate MADRA's superior performance over baselines. Ablations validate the efficacy of its debate framework, evidence retrieval, self-selection, and hyperparameter choices. Thus, MADRA effectively enhances multi-agent debate performance for complex reasoning via retrieval augmentation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-agent debate framework called MADRA that incorporates retrieval of prior knowledge to enhance reasoning capabilities by overcoming agents' cognitive constraints, and includes a self-selection module for agents to choose relevant evidence from a pool to minimize the impact of irrelevant information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel multi-agent debate framework that first introduces retrieval prior knowledge to break cognitive constraints, thereby enhancing the performance of the model in complex reasoning tasks.

2. Proposing a self-selection method that empowers agents to autonomously identify and utilize helpful knowledge from an evidence pool, thus effectively filtering out noisy data.

3. Conducting experiments on complex reasoning tasks and fact-verification tasks respectively, with results indicating the superior performance of their model.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed framework of Multi-Agent Debate with Retrieval Augmented (MADRA) effectively break the cognitive constraints of agents during debates? What specific mechanisms allow it to overcome issues like agents adhering to incorrect viewpoints or abandoning correct ones?

2. What were the key considerations in designing the self-selection module that allows agents to choose relevant evidence from a pool? How does it balance maximizing useful information while minimizing noise? 

3. The paper mentions employing both Wikipedia and Google search results as sources of evidence. What are the relative merits and disadvantages of each source and in what types of tasks does each tend to be more effective?

4. How was the Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) specifically implemented for Wikipedia evidence retrieval? What passage encoding and question encoding networks were used and what were the advantages of this approach?

5. What ablation studies were conducted to validate the efficacy of different components like the debate framework, integration of retrieval knowledge, and self-selection module? What were the key insights gained?  

6. How does varying factors like the number of debate rounds and agents impact overall model performance and debate dynamics? What patterns emerge regarding consensus building?

7. Could the self-selection mechanism be expanded to also allow filtering of poor quality or misleading evidence rather than just not useful evidence? What challenges would this entail?

8. How suitable is this model for real-time knowledge retrieval from very large corpora? What optimizations would be needed to maintain tractable run times?

9. The summarization step compiles a final response - could this instead be turned into a clarification stage where follow up questions are asked to resolve any lingering uncertainties?

10. How well would this approach generalize to non-English languages where access to large pre-trained models is more limited? Would translation mechanisms be needed?
