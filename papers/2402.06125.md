# [Language Model Sentence Completion with a Parser-Driven Rhetorical   Control Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06125)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for controlled text generation (CTG) using large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to leverage an existing rhetorical structure theory (RST) parser to enforce desired rhetorical relations between spans of text generated by the LLM. 

The paper first provides background on LLMs and their ability to fluently generate text in an uncontrolled, black-box manner. It then discusses prior work on controlled text generation, including prompt engineering and plug-and-play approaches that steer LLM output without fine-tuning. Rhetorical structure theory for relating clauses and sentences is also reviewed.  

The paper proposes a pipeline that takes an input text span (the prompt) and a target rhetorical relation as input. The LLM first generates a distribution of next tokens. An RST parser then re-ranks this distribution to favor tokens that better fit the desired rhetorical relation when concatenated to the prompt. The next token is selected greedily and appended to the prompt. This continues until the parser detects an entire elementary discourse unit (EDU) has been produced.

The method is evaluated both automatically and via human annotation. Automatic parsing success and perplexity analysis show the method achieves high success in generating text with the target rhetorical relation, without degrading fluency. Human evaluation of relation-fit, fluency and reasonableness also demonstrate the approach's ability to steer LLM output while maintaining generation quality.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) a novel plug-and-play method for controlled text generation using rhetorical structure theory and large language models; (2) automatic and human evaluations demonstrating success in enforcing target relations without sacrificing quality; (3) analysis providing insights into where/how much perturbation is needed to steer language model output.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel method for controlled text generation that enforces desired rhetorical relations in language model completions by using a parser to re-rank the language model's token distributions during decoding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is a novel controlled text generation algorithm that enforces adherence toward specific rhetorical relations in an LLM sentence-completion context by a parser-driven decoding scheme that requires no model fine-tuning. In other words, the paper presents a method to control the text generation of a large language model to produce sequences that conform to desired rhetorical relationships between spans of text, without needing to fine-tune the language model. This is achieved by incorporating an existing rhetorical structure theory (RST) parser into the language model's decoding process to favor generations that satisfy specified rhetorical relations. The paper validates this method through both automatic metrics and human evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Controlled text generation (CTG): Seeks to guide large language model (LLM) output to produce text that conforms to desired criteria
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST): A theory that articulates how clausal units in a sentence and between sentences relate to one another to deliver meaning coherently
- Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs): The basic units in RST that make up a rhetorical structure 
- Relation attribution: Arranging EDUs into a binary tree and assigning each edge to be a specific relation between two EDUs
- Plug-and-play approaches: Allow for controlled generation of text without expensive fine-tuning of language models
- Parser-driven decoding: Using an RST parser to influence the text generation behavior of an LLM to enforce rhetorical relations
- Automatic evaluation: Validating the method's ability to generate text with desired relations using parsing and perplexity metrics
- Human evaluation: Validating the method's ability to generate high-quality and logical text using fluency, reasonableness and relation-fit ratings

In summary, the key focus is on controlling text generation from large language models by enforcing rhetorical/discourse relations using a parser, evaluated both automatically and by human judgements.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel CTG algorithm that incorporates a parser to enforce rhetorical relations between spans of generated text. Can you explain in more detail how this parser-driven decoding scheme works to guide the language model's output? 

2. One benefit highlighted is that this method does not require fine-tuning the language model. Why is being able to control text generation in a plug-and-play manner useful? What are some potential applications that could benefit from this?

3. The method utilizes two models - a general language model and an RST parser. What were the specific models used in this study and why were they selected? What are some pros and cons of the chosen models?  

4. The stopping criteria outlined involves using the RST parser's segmenter to detect when an entire EDU has been generated. Can you explain why this criteria was chosen? How robust is it?

5. For re-ranking the language model's distribution, several parameters are introduced (p, k, τ, α). Can you explain what each controls and how the chosen values affect model performance?  

6. The perturbation analysis provides insight into where control is exerted most. Why does influence decrease after the first few tokens? How could the method potentially leverage this insight?

7. For automatic evaluation, correctness percentage and perplexity metrics were used. Can you critically analyze whether these capture all desired aspects of model performance? What other metrics could complement the analysis?

8. While subjective human annotations were utilized, the paper notes no baseline exists for the relation-fit metric. How could the experimental design be improved to better analyze this key aspect?  

9. The paper states computational overhead increases due to parsing text during each generation step. Can you estimate the impact and discuss any techniques to address this?

10. What do you see as the most promising future directions for this line of research on controlled text generation using rhetorical structure theory principles? What are some limitations still to be addressed?
