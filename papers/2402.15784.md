# [IRConStyle: Image Restoration Framework Using Contrastive Learning and   Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15784)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Contrastive learning (CL) has shown great success in high-level vision tasks but has limited effectiveness when applied to low-level image restoration (IR) tasks. The key question is - why does CL not work as well for IR? 

Analysis and Guidelines:
- The authors analyze limitations of CL for IR and propose 3 guidelines:  
   1) Use additional data structures to store more positive/negative samples
   2) Fully utilize encoder's intermediate features not just output code 
   3) Adopt reasonable pretext tasks suited for IR, not just instance discrimination

Proposed Solution - IRConStyle Framework:
- Propose IRConStyle framework comprising ConStyle module + general restoration network
   - ConStyle module extracts multi-scale latent features using CL
   - Restoration network takes degraded image + latent features and restores clean image
- Apply idea of style transfer - treat degradations as styles, guide latent features to be close to clean image space  

ConStyle Module: 
- Based on MoCo CL framework
- Uses clean images as positive samples, degraded as queries, queue stores negative samples
- Employs content and style losses for reverse style transfer
  
General Restoration Network:
- U-Net style network with replaceable modules
- Takes degraded image and ConStyle features as input
- Produces restored clean image

Experiments:
- Test on image deraining, deblurring, denoising and dehazing datasets
- Replace restoration network with Transformer, CNN and MLP based networks
- Show ConStyle improves performance over state-of-the-art approaches across tasks

Main Contributions:
- Guidelines to effectively apply CL for image restoration
- Novel ConStyle module leveraging CL and style transfer
- General IRConStyle framework comprising ConStyle + restoration network
- State-of-the-art results on multiple image restoration benchmarks
