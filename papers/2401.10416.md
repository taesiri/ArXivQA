## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Effective visualization and interpretation of complex, multi-dimensional datasets is critical for fields like data science and AI, but poses significant challenges. 
- Traditional 2D data visualizations have limitations in conveying relationships in high-dimensional data. 3D visualizations offer more flexibility but can still be restricted.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes DataViz3D, an innovative online software tool for transforming complex datasets into interactive 3D spatial data models using holographic technology. 
- It enables users to map data dimensions (up to 6) to visual properties like position, size, shape and color of 3D geometric objects. This provides an intuitive view of relationships.
- It also allows holographic projection of the 3D data models for a highly immersive analytic experience.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces an accessible way for users to create vivid 3D data models that convey inherent spatial relationships more effectively than 2D alternatives. 
- Significantly enhances interpretation of high-dimensional data by mapping additional attributes to visual cues like size, shape and color.
- Pioneers the use of holographic projection for displaying interactive 3D data models, enabling uniquely immersive analytic experiences. 
- Showcases the utility of DataViz3D for gaining new insights through a sample visualization of the Iris flower dataset.
- Makes advanced 3D modeling and holographic visualization more accessible for interdisciplinary collaborative work.

In summary, DataViz3D enables intuitive yet multidimensional 3D data visualization augmented by an innovative holographic projection mechanism for unprecedented immersive analytic experiences.
