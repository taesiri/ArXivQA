# [LLM-Assisted Crisis Management: Building Advanced LLM Platforms for   Effective Emergency Response and Public Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10908)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional emergency response systems face challenges managing large-scale crises due to information overload, communication bottlenecks, and need for rapid coordinated action. This is amplified in dense urban areas impacting millions.
- Language barriers pose additional challenges. Significant portion of 911 callers are non-native English speakers, risking miscommunication and slower emergency response.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop two frameworks integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into emergency response to enhance efficiency:
   1. Optimizing 911 Dispatch Operations: LLM processes 911 calls in real-time to generate instructions for dispatcher and extract vital information to assist response.
   2. Public Collaboration System: LLM-enhanced mobile app provides public real-time guidance and categorizes incidents to direct info to authorities during overwhelmed 911 scenarios. 

Main Contributions:
- Real-time transcription, multilingual support and analysis of 911 calls by LLM to aid dispatchers
- Systematic categorization of incidents and crowdsourced info transfer to response agencies to improve crisis management
- Mobile app for public allows localized AI-powered instructions during emergencies when 911 systems overloaded
- Detailed comparison of capabilities of various LLMs - LLAMA2 13B found most suitable for balancing size and performance
- Framework design allows synergistic collaboration between human expertise and AI assistance for swifter emergency response

Key aspects covered include the limitations of current systems, innovative framework designs proposed, critical advantages offered, experimental evaluations of AI models and metrics, potential challenges, and the promise of LLMs in revolutionizing future emergency management strategies.
