# [Global existence and decay estimates for a viscoelastic plate equation   with nonlinear damping and logarithmic nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.0983)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1) Establish the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for the viscoelastic plate equation with logarithmic nonlinearity considered in the paper. 2) Prove stability and decay rate estimates for the energy of solutions to this equation under certain conditions on the parameters and initial data.In particular, the authors are interested in studying this viscoelastic plate model with a logarithmic nonlinearity term and a nonlinear damping term. Their main goals are to:- Prove local and global existence of solutions using the Faedo-Galerkin method.- Derive energy decay rate estimates for the solutions under certain assumptions, showing the stability of the model. - Obtain both explicit decay rates in terms of the relaxation kernel and more general/optimal decay rates depending on the behavior of the relaxation kernel.So in summary, the central research questions involve establishing well-posedness and stability for this nonlinear plate model through energy methods and decay rate estimates. The paper aims to understand how the nonlinear damping and logarithmic nonlinearity affect the dynamics and long-term behavior of solutions.
