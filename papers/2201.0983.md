# [Global existence and decay estimates for a viscoelastic plate equation   with nonlinear damping and logarithmic nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.0983)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1) Establish the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for the viscoelastic plate equation with logarithmic nonlinearity considered in the paper. 2) Prove stability and decay rate estimates for the energy of solutions to this equation under certain conditions on the parameters and initial data.In particular, the authors are interested in studying this viscoelastic plate model with a logarithmic nonlinearity term and a nonlinear damping term. Their main goals are to:- Prove local and global existence of solutions using the Faedo-Galerkin method.- Derive energy decay rate estimates for the solutions under certain assumptions, showing the stability of the model. - Obtain both explicit decay rates in terms of the relaxation kernel and more general/optimal decay rates depending on the behavior of the relaxation kernel.So in summary, the central research questions involve establishing well-posedness and stability for this nonlinear plate model through energy methods and decay rate estimates. The paper aims to understand how the nonlinear damping and logarithmic nonlinearity affect the dynamics and long-term behavior of solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract and contents, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:- Establishing local existence of solutions to the viscoelastic plate equation with logarithmic nonlinearity using the Faedo-Galerkin method. - Proving global existence of solutions under smallness conditions on the initial data.- Deriving general decay rate estimates for the energy under different assumptions on the relaxation function and nonlinearity. Specifically, the authors consider a viscoelastic plate equation with nonlinear damping and a logarithmic nonlinearity. Using the Faedo-Galerkin approximation, they first show local existence of weak solutions. Then under certain constraints on the initial energy, they prove a global existence result. The main technical part is deriving the decay rates for the energy. They establish both explicit and general decay estimates under different assumptions on the relaxation kernel (linear or nonlinear) and the damping nonlinearity (linear or nonlinear). The decay rates are shown to depend on the behavior of these functions.So in summary, the key contributions are establishing well-posedness and proving stability by obtaining general decay estimates for this plate equation with logarithmic nonlinearity and nonlinear damping. The results generalize previous work in this area.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and context, here is a brief comparison to other related research:- This paper studies a specific viscoelastic plate equation involving nonlinear damping, logarithmic nonlinearity, and memory effects. The focus is establishing existence, smoothness and decay properties of solutions. This type of analysis for nonlinear plate equations has been studied before by other researchers.- However, this paper considers a more complex model than some previous work by including the nonlinear damping term, logarithmic nonlinearity, and a fairly general memory kernel. Many other papers study simplified versions of the model like just a power-law nonlinearity without logarithmic effects. - The techniques used - Galerkin method, energy methods, convexity arguments - are typical of other papers in this field. The paper cites and builds on a number of recent related studies.- A key contribution seems to be proving decay rates for this model under fairly mild assumptions on the relaxation kernel. Previous papers required more restrictive assumptions. This expands our understanding of stability for this class of nonlinear plate models.- Overall, this seems like an incremental advance providing mathematical analysis of a more complex viscoelastic plate model. It expands on prior work by considering a more general case and proving new decay rate estimates. The techniques are similar to related literature but carefully adapted to handle the specific model complexities.In summary, this paper provides a valuable mathematical analysis of a nonlinear viscoelastic plate equation using established but appropriately tailored techniques. It builds nicely on recent literature and expands our theoretical understanding of this class of models. The results seem like an incremental but meaningful advance for this research area.
