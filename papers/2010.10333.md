# CR-Walker: Tree-Structured Graph Reasoning and Dialog Acts for   Conversational Recommendation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1. How to perform multi-hop reasoning on a knowledge graph to select relevant entities for recommendation in a conversational setting? 2. How to utilize the selected entities to generate natural, informative, and engaging system responses to interact with users in conversational recommendation?More specifically:- The paper proposes a tree-structured reasoning approach on a knowledge graph to select entities through multi-path, multi-hop reasoning. This aims to address the limitation of prior work that uses single-path reasoning or does not fully exploit entity relationships. - The paper transforms the reasoning tree into a hierarchical dialog act representation to guide response generation. This aims to generate more natural and engaging utterances compared to prior work that focuses only on entity selection without explicit language generation.- The tree-structured reasoning connects how entities are selected via reasoning and how they are expressed in the response, improving both recommendation accuracy and conversation quality.In summary, the key hypotheses are:1. Multi-hop, tree-structured reasoning on a knowledge graph can improve recommendation accuracy by better utilizing entity relationships.2. Transforming the reasoning tree into dialog acts can generate more natural, informative, and engaging responses for conversational recommendation.3. Jointly optimizing the reasoning and generation addresses limitations of prior work and leads to improvements in both recommendation and conversation quality.The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by evaluating recommendation accuracy, dialog coherence/engagement, and knowledge utilization compared to prior conversational recommendation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a conversational recommendation model called CR-Walker that performs tree-structured reasoning on a knowledge graph and generates responses guided by dialog acts. Specifically:- CR-Walker conducts multi-hop reasoning on a knowledge graph to select relevant entities for recommendation through exploring different reasoning paths. This allows it to recommend items based on multiple supporting aspects. - CR-Walker transforms the reasoning tree into a hierarchical dialog act representation. The dialog act captures the semantics and structure of selected entities to guide response generation. This helps CR-Walker generate more informative and engaging responses.- Evaluations show CR-Walker achieves strong performance on recommendation accuracy and response quality compared to existing conversational recommendation methods. It also demonstrates good explainability.In summary, the key novelty is using tree-structured reasoning to select entities and generating responses based on dialog acts. This links the reasoning process for entity selection with how the entities are expressed in the response, enabling CR-Walker to conduct informative conversations for recommendation.
