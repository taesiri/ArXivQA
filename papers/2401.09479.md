# [Uncertainty-Aware Hardware Trojan Detection Using Multimodal Deep   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Hardware Trojans (HTs) pose a growing security threat as they can be maliciously inserted into chips during the fabless manufacturing process. Detecting HTs is challenging due to the limited availability of benchmarks, especially for rare Trojans, and susceptibility of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. There is a need for more robust and generalizable approaches.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes NOODLE, an uncertainty-aware multimodal deep learning framework for HT detection. The key aspects are:

1. Multimodal learning using two representations of circuit data:
   - Graph data 
   - Tabular data
This captures more nuanced relationships compared to using either modality alone.

2. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) to augment the imbalanced dataset and facilitate effective multimodal fusion.

3. Uncertainty-aware fusion of modalities using conformal prediction p-values. This enables calibrated predictions and risk-aware decision making.  

4. Evaluation using both early and late fusion strategies to pick the best approach.

Main Contributions:

1. First known investigation and implementation of multimodal learning for HT detection using graph and tabular circuit data.

2. Novel model fusion technique using p-values and uncertainty quantification for informed decision making.

3. Handles issues of missing modalities and small imbalanced datasets using GANs.

4. Experimental results demonstrate improved Brier score over individual modalities, showing efficacy of the proposed NOODLE framework. This opens doors for using multimodality and uncertainty awareness to tackle other hardware security challenges.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning approach called NOODLE for hardware Trojan detection that leverages both graph and tabular circuit representations along with generative adversarial networks for data augmentation and conformal prediction for uncertainty-aware fusion of modalities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multimodal deep learning approach called NOODLE (uNcertainty-aware hardware TrOjan detectiOn using multimoDal deep LEarning) for hardware Trojan detection. Specifically, the key contributions highlighted in the paper are:

1) Proposing a multimodal learning approach that uses both graph and tabular/Euclidean representations of the hardware circuits as input modalities. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to use a multimodal approach for hardware Trojan detection.

2) Suggesting an uncertainty-aware model fusion approach using p-values and conformal prediction. This enables assessing the significance of each modality's contribution and makes the fusion process more interpretable and decisions more robust. 

3) Addressing the challenges of missing modalities and small/imbalanced datasets by using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to amplify the data.

In summary, the main novelty of this work is in applying multimodal deep learning with uncertainty quantification to the task of hardware Trojan detection, which has not been explored before. The feasibility of this approach and its advantages over single modality methods are demonstrated through experimental evaluation.
