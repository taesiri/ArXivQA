# [Beyond Anti-Forgetting: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning with   Positive Forward Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09181)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT), where multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like InstructBLIP are incrementally adapted to new vision-language tasks via instruction tuning, without expensive retraining. 
- Two key challenges in MCIT are catastrophic forgetting (forgetting old tasks when learning new ones) and negative forward transfer (performance on future tasks gets worse).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes the input embedding space using SVD and finds a large discrepancy across tasks. This discrepancy causes the model to learn irrelevant information leading to the two aforementioned problems. 
- To address this, they propose a prompt-based method called Fwd-Prompt that projects the prompt gradient to:
  (1) The residual space to allocate different subspaces for each task and minimize interference (anti-forgetting).
  (2) The pre-trained space to reuse knowledge from pre-training for positive forward transfer.

Contributions:  
- Identify that the key challenge of MCIT is achieving both anti-forgetting and positive forward transfer.
- Reveal input embedding discrepancy causes catastrophic forgetting and negative forward transfer.
- Propose Fwd-Prompt which outperforms state-of-the-art by a large margin, while requiring fewer trainable parameters and no old task samples.

In summary, the paper provides useful insights into the forgetting behaviors in MCIT and presents an effective prompt-based solution to mitigate the key issues for continual adaptation of MLLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Fwd-Prompt, a prompt-based method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal continual instruction tuning by allocating different subspaces for each task to mitigate forgetting and reusing pre-trained knowledge to enable positive transfer to future tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It identifies that the key challenges of Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) are catastrophic forgetting and negative forward transfer.

2. It analyzes the space of input embeddings and reveals that the discrepancy in input embeddings leads to catastrophic forgetting and negative forward transfer. 

3. It proposes Fwd-Prompt for MCIT, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while requiring less trainable parameters and no rehearsal data. Fwd-Prompt achieves this by allocating different subspaces for each task to minimize interference and projecting prompt gradients to reuse pre-trained knowledge.

The paper explores the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and negative forward transfer when incrementally instruction tuning MLLMs on new vision-language tasks. It proposes a prompt-based method called Fwd-Prompt that achieves anti-forgetting by allocating different subspaces for each task and projects prompt gradients to residual spaces. It also achieves positive forward transfer by reusing pre-trained knowledge and projecting prompt gradients to pre-trained spaces. The method utilizes singular value decomposition, core spaces, residual spaces, pre-trained spaces, and conflicting spaces in its formulation. Overall, the key focus is on multimodal continual instruction tuning of large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using singular value decomposition (SVD) to analyze the input embedding space. Can you explain in more detail how SVD was applied and what specific insights were gained about catastrophic forgetting and negative forward transfer?

2. The key idea of Fwd-Prompt is to project the prompt gradient into different subspaces. What were the specific subspaces identified and how does projecting into them help mitigate forgetting and encourage forward transfer?

3. The paper proposes selecting prompts based on both visual and textual features. What is the motivation behind using features from both modalities instead of just one? How does this lead to better prompt selection?

4. Explain the concepts of "core space" and "residual space" introduced in Section 3.2. How are these spaces computed and why is projecting into the residual space important for anti-forgetting?  

5. Section 3.3 describes reusing pre-trained knowledge to enhance positive forward transfer. Can you walk through how the "conflicting spaces" are identified and how projecting gradients to avoid these spaces helps achieve forward transfer?

6. How exactly does Fwd-Prompt allocate different subspaces to different tasks? Explain how this avoids interference between tasks and hence minimizes catastrophic forgetting.

7. The ablation study shows that both the prompt pool and gradient projection are critical components. Analyze why leaving out either of them leads to substantially worse performance.

8. Fig. 3 provides some visualizations about forward transfer in Fwd-Prompt. Interpret the key insights gained from each subfigure and relate them to how Fwd-Prompt achieves its results.

9. Compare and contrast Fwd-Prompt to prior state-of-the-art methods on the MCIT benchmark. What are some key advantages that explain its superior performance? 

10. What limitations of the current research does the paper identify in the conclusion? How can future work address these limitations?
