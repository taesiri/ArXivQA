# [Open-DDVM: A Reproduction and Extension of Diffusion Model for Optical   Flow Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01746)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the first open-source reproduction of the recent DDVM model for optical flow estimation using diffusion models. The authors reproduce DDVM using public data and limited computational resources, achieving comparable performance to the original closed-source DDVM. Through ablation studies, they determine important design choices like input/output normalization and data augmentations. They also propose a modification by incorporating correlation volumes from classic optical flow techniques as an inductive bias, demonstrating improved performance and faster training. With only 1/3 training iterations, their modified network with correlation volumes approaches the performance of the original network trained for far longer. The authors contribute the first open-source diffusion model for optical flow, hoping to advance research in this direction. Their work shows the promise of diffusion models for optical flow while also revealing the importance of specific architectural designs to enable accurate flow estimation.
