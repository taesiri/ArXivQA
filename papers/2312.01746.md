# [Open-DDVM: A Reproduction and Extension of Diffusion Model for Optical   Flow Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01746)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the first open-source reproduction of the recent DDVM model for optical flow estimation using diffusion models. The authors reproduce DDVM using public data and limited computational resources, achieving comparable performance to the original closed-source DDVM. Through ablation studies, they determine important design choices like input/output normalization and data augmentations. They also propose a modification by incorporating correlation volumes from classic optical flow techniques as an inductive bias, demonstrating improved performance and faster training. With only 1/3 training iterations, their modified network with correlation volumes approaches the performance of the original network trained for far longer. The authors contribute the first open-source diffusion model for optical flow, hoping to advance research in this direction. Their work shows the promise of diffusion models for optical flow while also revealing the importance of specific architectural designs to enable accurate flow estimation.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Optical flow estimation is an important computer vision task with many applications. Recently, Google proposed a closed-source diffusion model called DDVM that achieves state-of-the-art performance without task-specific designs. However, DDVM relies on expensive pretraining and is not open-source. 

Proposed Solution:
- This paper presents the first open-source reproduction of DDVM for optical flow estimation trained from scratch. 
- They propose a correlation volume assisted diffusion model that incorporates inductive biases from classic optical flow techniques like RAFT. This assists the diffusion model training.
- The model takes a noise-corrupted optical flow as input along with two input RGB frames. A U-Net architecture predicts the noise-free optical flow.
- During training, the RGB frames are encoded and concatenated with a correlation feature extracted from a multi-scale correlation volume between the frames. This provides useful matching priors.

Main Contributions:
- First open-source reproduction of the state-of-the-art DDVM optical flow model without reliance on expensive pretraining.
- Achieves comparable performance to original DDVM model using only public data and training from scratch. 
- Analyzes design choices for diffusion models on this task and shows that incorporating correlation volumes significantly boosts performance and reduces training costs.
- The released model and code will facilitate further research on diffusion models for optical flow estimation.

In summary, this paper makes diffusion models for optical flow estimation more accessible by presenting an open-source reproduction without reliance on proprietary pretraining. The analysis and released model will assist further research in this direction.
