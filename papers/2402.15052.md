# [ToMBench: Benchmarking Theory of Mind in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15052)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: There is an ongoing debate over whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a form of theory of mind (ToM) capabilities. However, existing evaluations of LLMs' ToM abilities have limitations such as narrow scope, subjective judgments, and risk of data contamination. These make it difficult to adequately assess if advanced LLMs have achieved human-level ToM.

Proposed Solution: This paper introduces ToMBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ToM abilities. ToMBench has three key features:

(1) Systematic evaluation framework: Covers 8 well-established ToM tasks from psychology literature. Further maps tasks to 31 core ToM abilities defined in the ATOMS framework to enable comprehensive ability-based assessment.  

(2) Multiple-choice format: Formulates test samples as short stories with a question and answer options. Enables automatic evaluation without costly expert annotations. Avoids inconsistency in human ratings.

(3) Custom bilingual data: Includes 2,860 manually created ToM test samples in Chinese and English strictly built from scratch. Avoids contamination from existing datasets that LLMs may have encountered during training.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes the first systematic ToM benchmark, ToMBench, to evaluate LLMs' social intelligence abilities in a rigorous manner.

- Extensive experiments on 10 major LLMs using ToMBench reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4 still lag behind human performance substantially, despite surpassing humans on some specific abilities.

- Analysis shows LLMs still rely more on superficial semantics rather than genuine understanding of social scenarios for ToM tasks, contrasting human cognitive processes.

- ToMBench facilitates reliable assessment of LLMs' ToM capabilities and drives progress in developing LLMs' social intelligence to promote more natural human-AI interaction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ToMBench, the first systematic theory of mind (ToM) benchmark for large language models (LLMs). Key features of ToMBench include:

1) A systematic evaluation framework encompassing 8 tasks and 31 abilities related to social cognition and theory of mind.

2) A multiple-choice question format to enable automated and unbiased evaluation at scale. 

3) An original bilingual (Chinese/English) inventory with 2,860 test samples built from scratch to avoid data contamination risks.

4) Extensive experiments evaluating 10 popular LLMs using ToMBench, revealing that even the most advanced models like GPT-4 still lag behind human performance by over 10 percentage points.

5) In-depth analysis showing existing LLMs still struggle to comprehensively understand social scenarios and rely more on semantic associations than human-like reasoning when addressing ToM questions.

In summary, ToMBench provides an efficient and effective way to evaluate LLMs' theory of mind capabilities to facilitate research into developing models with more inherent social intelligence. The overall goal is to complement LLMs' task-solving abilities with deeper understanding of human social contexts.

The paper introduces ToMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate the theory of mind capabilities of large language models. It features a systematic framework of tasks and abilities, an automated multiple-choice question format, and a build-from-scratch bilingual inventory. Experiments are conducted on 10 popular LLMs using ToMBench. The results indicate LLMs have not achieved human-level performance, underscoring limitations in understanding real-world social scenarios. Further analysis also reveals differences in reasoning processes between LLMs and humans.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new benchmark called ToMBench for evaluating theory of mind in large language models. What are some key motivations and gaps that ToMBench aims to address compared to prior work on evaluating LLMs' theory of mind capabilities?

2. ToMBench covers 8 theory-of-mind tasks mapped to 31 abilities in the ATOMS framework. What considerations went into the selection and mapping of these specific tasks and abilities? How do they collectively provide a more comprehensive assessment?  

3. The paper constructs a multiple-choice question format for ToMBench to enable automated evaluation. What are some of the key benefits of this format? What steps were taken during data collection and validation to ensure high-quality distractors/wrong answer choices?

4. One highlighted characteristic of ToMBench is being "original" and built from scratch. What measures were implemented during data collection to avoid risk of contamination and ensure the data is in fact novel?

5. Experiments are conducted evaluating 10 LLMs with two prompting strategies. What differences were observed between vanilla prompting and chain-of-thought prompting? What may explain why CoT prompting does not appear to improve ToM capabilities?

6. Results show GPT-4 attains highest performance, yet still lags behind humans by over 10 percentage points. Where do the key gaps seem to remain in LLMs' theory of mind mastery compared to humans based on the analysis?

7. The coherent test provides a more challenging evaluation by requiring correct answers to all questions of a story. What key observations can be made from LLM performance changes between the original test and this stricter coherent test?

8. Attention visualizations reveal differences in decision making processes between LLMs and humans. What key patterns are observed that differentiate the LLM's reliance on semantics rather than comprehension of mental states?

9. What are some limitations of the current benchmark and evaluation that may warrant additional development or research in future work? 

10. How might the availability of an extensive theory of mind benchmark like ToMBench promote developments in designing LLMs with more inherent social intelligence? What directions appear promising for better incorporating components of theory of mind?
