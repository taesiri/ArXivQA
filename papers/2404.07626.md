# [Homography Guided Temporal Fusion for Road Line and Marking Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07626)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Homography Guided Temporal Fusion for Road Line and Marking Segmentation":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of road line and marking segmentation in images captured by on-vehicle cameras for autonomous driving applications. A key challenge is that road lines and markings are frequently occluded due to other vehicles, shadows, glare etc., leading to incorrect segmentation. Existing methods do not effectively address such occlusion issues. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Homography Guided Fusion (HomoFusion) module to exploit information from temporally adjacent frames to obtain accurate segmentation of occluded road markings. The key ideas are:

1) Road lines and markings have high intra-class consistency and structures. So simpler features can distinguish them compared to complex semantic segmentation.

2) Occlusions are reduced by using cross-frame consistency of road markings since they persist across frames.

3) Accurate pixel correspondence across frames is established using a homography matrix, which depends on a novel Road Surface Normal Estimator (RSNE).

4) A lightweight encoder-decoder model with cross-frame pixel attention is used for segmentation.

Key Contributions:

1) HomoFusion module that establishes spatial correspondence across frames using homography matrix and fuses features for robust segmentation.

2) Road Surface Normal Estimator (RSNE) method to accurately estimate homography matrix by optimizing surface normal vector.

3) Lightweight model with cross-frame pixel attention that outperforms state-of-the-art with 9x fewer parameters and 83x fewer FLOPs. 

4) Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on ApolloScape and ApolloScape Night datasets for road marking segmentation. Also showed promising results for water hazard segmentation task.

In summary, the paper presents a novel temporally consistent method for segmenting road markings that are often occluded, using ideas of homography between frames and lightweight pixel attention based fusion.
