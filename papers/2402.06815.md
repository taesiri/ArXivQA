# [Estimating Player Performance in Different Contexts Using Fine-tuned   Large Events Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06815)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating player performance and contribution is complex, as it depends heavily on team context and dynamics. Traditional player metrics fail to capture this contextual impact. 
- 50% of soccer transfers fail due to factors like adaptability issues and lack of fit with team style. Existing methods cannot quantify player-team compatibility.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use fine-tuned Large Event Models (LEMs) to simulate player performance in different team contexts across various metrics.
- LEMs predict next event based on current game state, enabling match simulation. Fine-tuning makes them learn team behaviors.  
- Assess player impact on metrics like points, shots, passes by comparing simulations of team with and without player.

Experiments and Results:
- Fine-tuned LEMs of EPL teams in 2017/18 season, evaluated predictive accuracy. Good top-6 prediction, poorer for very competitive bottom teams.
- Simulated impact of adding/replacing Messi & Ronaldo. Varies by team - reduced Man City variance but no improvement in average. 
- Limitations: isolating player from team context difficult. Underestimates changes player can bring to team style.

Key Contributions:
- Novel framework to quantify player-team compatibility and expected contribution.
- Contextual analysis reveals much narrower performance gaps compared to general metrics. 
- Demonstrated strengths and limitations of using LEMs for soccer analytics.
- Highlighted importance of contextual factors in player evaluation.

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed solution involving fine-tuned LEMs, experiments on the Premier League teams and star players, results showing predictive accuracy and contextual impacts, limitations of the current approach, and the main contributions around using simulations to evaluate player performance in different team settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper demonstrates how fine-tuned Large Event Models can effectively simulate soccer matches and provide insights into player performance across different team contexts, using the examples of hypothetically transferring Messi and Ronaldo into Premier League teams.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating the effectiveness and limitations of using Large Event Models (LEMs) in soccer analytics, specifically for evaluating player performance in different team contexts. 

The key points related to the main contribution are:

- LEMs can learn and understand a team's playstyle, allowing for detailed analysis of a player's potential impact/fit within that specific context across various metrics derived from event data. 

- This allows for insights going beyond just summarizing player attributes, and can inform player recruitment strategy by predicting performance under different scenarios.

- The limitations are that LEMs struggle to completely isolate a player's influence from their current team context. Also, LEMs are better at evaluating fit within a current playstyle rather than potential changes the player's inclusion could bring to that playstyle.

So in summary, the main contribution is showing that LEMs represent a valuable but still evolving tool for context-specific player analysis and recruitment insights in soccer.

The paper introduces an application of Large Event Models, similar to Large Language Models, to simulate soccer matches and evaluate player performance across different team contexts. It utilizes fine-tuning of LEMs on soccer data to provide insights into hypothetical transfers of superstar players like Ronaldo and Messi to Premier League teams. The contextual analysis is a key focus, assessing compatibility between players and teams. The methodology allows prediction across metrics like expected points, shots, and more. Overall, the key terms revolve around using LEMs for predictive modeling and simulation in the domain of sports analytics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that around 50% of soccer transfers fail. What are some of the key reasons cited in the paper for why transfers fail? How does the proposed LEM methodology aim to address some of these failure reasons?

2. The paper argues that current approaches for valuing player actions neglect to account for contextual factors. What are some examples of contextual factors that can influence a player's performance and value? How does the LEM methodology account for context?

3. Explain the concept of "fine-tuning" an LEM. What is the two-stage process involved? How does fine-tuning allow an LEM to learn new contexts and behaviors?

4. What is the difference between the "Player Addition" and "Player Replacement" categories for measuring a player's performance with an LEM? Why does the paper argue that player replacement may allow for combining individual player impact distributions?

5. The paper explores simulated impacts of adding Messi and Ronaldo to different Premier League teams. Why do the superstars fail to improve the already high-performing Manchester City squad? What does this indicate about the importance of context in transfer decisions?

6. What are some of the key strengths and limitations of using LEMs for player performance analysis as outlined in the discussion section? How might some of these limitations be addressed in future work? 

7. The paper argues LEMs struggle to fully isolate a player's influence from their current team context. Why is this the case? How does this limitation impact the accuracy of simulated player transfers to new teams?

8. The results show more predictable match outcomes when star players are added to teams. What metric indicates this finding? Why might star players decrease outcome variability?

9. What are some areas suggested for improving LEMs in the future, such as expanding training data, model architectures, and context size? How might these impovements strengthen insights and decision-making?

10. What are the key conclusions regarding using LEMs for player performance analysis and recruitment decisions? What factors might influence the accuracy and effectiveness of these simulations?
