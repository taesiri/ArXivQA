# [UCE-FID: Using Large Unlabeled, Medium Crowdsourced-Labeled, and Small   Expert-Labeled Tweets for Foodborne Illness Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Foodborne illnesses significantly impact public health and early detection is crucial for risk reduction and outbreak control. 
- Developing machine learning models for foodborne illness detection using Twitter data is challenging due to: (1) difficulty of collecting sufficient high-quality labeled data within a limited budget, and (2) class imbalance caused by the scarcity of relevant tweets among large volumes of irrelevant tweets.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes EGAL (Expert Labels Guided Approach Learning), a framework that trains a foodborne illness detection model using a combination of small expert-labeled, medium crowdsourced-labeled, and large unlabeled tweet datasets.

- EGAL utilizes the small expert-labeled set as a "reward" set to guide the training. It assigns weights to the losses of the crowdsourced and unlabeled tweets based on their influence on the model's performance on the expert-labeled set. 

- Falsely labeled tweets are assigned a weight of zero. The weights for the correctly labeled tweets are set proportionally to counter-balance the class imbalance.

- This reweighting process, guided by the performance on the expert-labeled set, reduces the impact of noisy labels and balances the class distribution.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of EGAL, a practical framework to train a foodborne illness detection model using unreliable crowdsourced labels augmented by expert labels and massive unlabeled tweets.

- Extensive evaluation showing EGAL's superior performance over strong baselines under varying expert-labeled set sizes and class imbalance ratios.

- Case study demonstrating that EGAL successfully captures informative tweets providing valuable insights related to a Salmonella outbreak associated with packaged salads.

- EGAL has the potential to be deployed for real-time tweet analysis, contributing to foodborne illness outbreak surveillance efforts.
