# [EGformer: Equirectangular Geometry-biased Transformer for 360 Depth   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07803)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design an efficient transformer architecture that achieves high performance for equirectangular image depth estimation? 

The key challenges are:

- Equirectangular images have a wide field of view and geometric distortion which makes convolutional networks ineffective. Transformers can handle the wide field of view through global attention, but global attention is computationally expensive.

- Local attention can be more efficient but it is challenging to apply effectively to equirectangular images due to the distortion and limited receptive field.

The main hypothesis of the paper is that the known equirectangular geometry can be used as a structural prior or bias to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a transformer with local attention for this task.

Specifically, the paper proposes an "Equirectangular Geometry-biased Transformer" (EGformer) that uses the equirectangular geometry:

- As a bias when computing self-attention within local windows, through an Equirectangular Relative Position Embedding (ERPE)

- To compute attention scores based on distances on the sphere rather than softmax

- To rearrange local attention windows based on their estimated importance, enabling local windows to interact indirectly to increase receptive field.

Through experiments, the paper aims to demonstrate that EGformer can achieve state-of-the-art depth estimation performance for equirectangular images, with high efficiency and fewer parameters compared to prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper seem to be:

- Proposing an equirectangular geometry-biased transformer called EGformer for efficient and accurate 360 degree depth estimation. 

- Introducing three main components to EGformer:
   - Equirectangular relative position embedding (ERPE) to impose geometry bias within local windows.
   - Distance-based attention score (DAS) to re-weight attention scores based on distances in spherical coordinates.
   - Equirectangular-aware attention rearrangement (EaAR) to impose geometry bias between local windows.

- Demonstrating that by utilizing the known equirectangular geometry as a bias, EGformer can achieve better depth estimation performance than previous methods while having lower computational cost and fewer parameters. 

- Conducting experiments on standard 360 degree depth estimation datasets like Structured3D and Pano3D to show quantitative and qualitative improvements over prior arts.

In summary, the key contribution is using the equirectangular geometry as an explicit bias to enable efficient and accurate extraction of local attention in transformers for 360 degree depth estimation. This improves performance while reducing computational requirements compared to prior work.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of 360 degree depth estimation:

- This paper focuses on using transformers and attention mechanisms for depth estimation, while much prior work has relied on CNNs and RNNs. The use of transformers is a relatively new approach in this field. 

- Compared to previous transformer-based methods like PanoFormer, this paper proposes more efficient attention mechanisms like the equirectangular-aware attention modules. This allows the model to achieve better performance with lower computational cost.

- The proposed EGformer model achieves state-of-the-art results on standard datasets like Structured3D and Pano3D, outperforming prior arts like Bifuse, SliceNet, and PanoFormer. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

- A key novelty is the use of explicit geometric priors and biases based on the equirectangular image properties in the attention modules. This allows better modeling of the distortions and characteristics of 360 degree images compared to generic attention.

- The ablation studies do a good job of isolating the improvements from the different components like ERPE, Das, and EaAR. This provides evidence that the proposed techniques contribute directly to the performance gains.

- Compared to global attention models, the local window attention allows greater efficiency and scalability. Compared to other local attention methods, the equirectangular-aware modules capture wider contexts and long-range dependencies.

In summary, the paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results by using transformer-based attention with explicit modeling of equirectangular geometry. The novel attention modules and efficiency improvements push forward the state of the art in 360 degree depth estimation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Investigating different network architectures and attention mechanisms for EGformer. The paper explores some variants of encoder-decoder architectures and attention blocks, but there is room for further exploration.

- Applying EGformer to other 360째 vision tasks beyond depth estimation, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, etc. The authors argue that the benefits of EGformer could generalize to other equirectangular image tasks.

- Developing strategies to train EGformer with less dependence on large-scale pretraining datasets. The paper notes that their approach does not require ImageNet pretraining like ViT, but still relies on specialized 360째 datasets. Reducing this dependence could improve applicability. 

- Exploring ways to impose equirectangular biases beyond the specific techniques proposed in EGformer. The ERPE, DAS, and EaAR methods demonstrate the potential benefits of using geometry priors, but the authors believe there may be other effective ways to bake in this inductive bias.

- Extending EGformer to handle 360째 video inputs. The current work focuses on single equirectangular images, but video introduces additional challenges like temporally consistent predictions.

- Improving depth accuracy, especially for challenging geometric structures and textures. The results show EGformer outperforms prior work, but there is still room for improvement in fine details and tricky cases.

In summary, the main future directions are developing EGformer variants, applying it to new tasks, reducing dataset dependence, finding new ways to impose geometry biases, handling video, and continuing to improve depth accuracy. The core ideas show promise for 360째 vision.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes EGformer, an equirectangular geometry-biased transformer for 360 depth estimation. EGformer utilizes the known equirectangular geometry as a bias when extracting local attention, allowing it to have a large receptive field while being efficient. The main components are: 1) Equirectangular relative position embedding (ERPE) which imposes geometry bias on elements within a local window, 2) Distance-based attention score (Das) which converts attention scores to distances in spherical coordinates, providing a symmetric and geometry-aware scoring, and 3) Equirectangular-aware attention rearrangement (EaAR) which rearranges local attentions based on their importance levels that are estimated using the geometry-biased attention scores. Experiments show EGformer achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on 360 datasets with low computational cost and model size. The geometry-biasing allows EGformer to efficiently extract accurate local attentions tailored for equirectangular images.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an equirectangular geometry-biased transformer called EGformer for 360-degree depth estimation. Equirectangular images have a wide distorted field of view which makes depth estimation challenging. Transformers can handle the wide field of view well due to their global attention, but they are computationally inefficient. CNNs are more efficient but have a limited receptive field. EGformer aims to get the benefits of both by using a transformer with local attention. It introduces three main components to enable extracting geometry-aware local attention with a large receptive field: equirectangular relative position embedding, distance-based attention scores, and equirectangular-aware attention rearrangement. These allow imposing a geometry bias on the local attention to handle the distortion. Experiments show EGformer achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on standard datasets with high efficiency and low computational cost compared to previous methods.

In more detail, EGformer uses separate vertical and horizontal transformer blocks to process the image, inspired by prior works showing vertical and horizontal processing is beneficial for equirectangular images. The local attention in these blocks is made geometry-aware through the three main proposals. The relative position embedding uses distances in spherical coordinates to account for distortion. The attention scores use distance from a baseline point rather than softmax to enable symmetric treatment of elements. The attention rearrangement reweights attention from different local regions based on their importance extracted from the biased attention scores. Together these allow EGformer to extract accurate local attention tailored to equirectangular images, providing global information without high computational cost. The experiments demonstrate clear improvements in depth estimation over prior state-of-the-art methods.
