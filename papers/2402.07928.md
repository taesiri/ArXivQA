# [Abstracted Trajectory Visualization for Explainability in Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07928)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Explainable AI (XAI) research has shown potential to help reinforcement learning (RL) practitioners understand how RL models work. However, XAI for non-RL experts has not been studied enough, making it difficult for them to participate in discussions on how RL models should be designed to fit society. There is a need for a new XAI approach requiring less descriptive knowledge so non-RL experts can understand RL agent behavior.

Proposed Solution:
The authors argue that visualizing abstracted trajectories depicting transitions between major RL agent states will help non-RL experts build mental models of agents. They introduce an algorithm to generate abstracted trajectories by:
1) Using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to extract interpretable feature vectors from agent observations 
2) Clustering the features using a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm to identify major states
3) Connecting the major states chronologically to form abstracted trajectories

They also propose an interactive visualization interface with two views:
1) A map view visualizing trajectories as a directed graph with nodes as states and edges as transitions
2) A slider view aligning states chronologically to show transitions

Users can interactively explore trajectories in both views to understand agent behavior patterns.

Contributions:
1) A trajectory abstraction algorithm to reduce complexity of agent trajectories for non-RL expert understanding
2) An interactive abstracted trajectory visualization interface with map and slider views
3) A framework to evaluate if abstracted trajectories help non-RL experts understand agent behaviors  

Preliminary results suggest comparable performance on identifying agent behaviors between abstracted and complete trajectories. Subjective feedback also shows the interface was useful but can be improved, providing insights for better visualization.
