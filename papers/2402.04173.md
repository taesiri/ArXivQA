# [COPS: A Compact On-device Pipeline for real-time Smishing detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Smishing attacks (phishing attacks via SMS/messaging apps) are increasing rapidly as smartphones become more ubiquitous. These attacks aim to steal private user information.
- Smishing websites are short-lived, making blocking lists ineffective. 
- Existing smishing detection solutions are not convenient (require separate apps) or deployable on-device in real-time.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose COPS, a compact on-device pipeline for real-time smishing detection that works across messaging platforms.
- It has 3 modules: Screen Understanding, Smishing Detection Network, Smishing Notifier.
- The detection network uses a disentangled variational autoencoder (β-VAE) model to identify smishing text.

Key Contributions:
- A complete pipeline for on-device, real-time smishing detection with a size of only 3.46MB. 
- A β-VAE based architecture for smishing text detection that outperforms prior works. 
- Benchmarking on open datasets for both smishing and URL phishing, achieving 98-99% accuracy.
- Demonstration of deployment on Android device, showing real-time detection with notifications.
- Proposal for synthetic smishing data generation to improve model performance.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in on-device smishing detection by proposing an efficient pipeline (COPS) that can identify fraudulent messages in real-time across messaging platforms. The core β-VAE model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, providing a solution to combat increasing smishing attacks faced by smartphone users.
