## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper introduces a new natural language processing task called "functionality extraction from Git README files". 
- This involves automatically extracting a list of features/functionalities supported by a software project from its README file on GitHub.
- Motivation is to help decompose monolith software applications into microservices by understanding functionality.
- Existing text summarization systems don't work well for this task.

Proposed Solution:
- Paper collects new dataset called "FuncRead" with 2,101 README files and human annotations of functionalities.
- Compares performance of different natural language models on functionally extracting from READMEs.
- Finds smaller fine-tuned models like CodeLlama outperform large pre-trained models like ChatGPT and Bard.

Key Contributions:
- Defines and formulates the novel task of functionality extraction from Git READMEs.
- Introduces FuncRead dataset with over 2k annotated README files.
- Shows fine-tuned models beat ChatGPT and Bard by over 70% and 20% F1 score respectively. 
- Provides systematic comparative analysis of different natural language models on this task.
- The new dataset and task analysis will help advance research on software comprehension.

In summary, the paper tackles a new applied NLP problem of extracting software functionalities from documentation, collects dataset, and shows tailored models outperforming general pre-trained language models. The work and analysis open up new research avenues at the intersection of NLP and software engineering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces a new task of automatically extracting functionalities from GitHub README files, releases a dataset, shows that small fine-tuned models outperform large language models like ChatGPT and Bard on this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper introduces a new task called "functionality extraction from Git README files". This is a variant of text summarization where the goal is to extract the key functionalities or features supported by a software application from its README file on GitHub.

2. The paper releases a new human-annotated dataset called "FuncRead" to enable research on this task. This dataset contains annotated functionalities in both extractive and abstractive forms for over 2000 GitHub README files.

3. The paper presents a comparative analysis of different generative models on the FuncRead dataset, including large language models like ChatGPT and Bard as well as smaller fine-tuned models. The results show that the smaller fine-tuned models can significantly outperform ChatGPT and Bard on this task.

4. The best performing model is a 7 billion parameter fine-tuned CodeLlama model, which achieves 70% and 20% higher F1 score compared to ChatGPT and Bard respectively on the functionality extraction task using the FuncRead dataset.

In summary, the key contributions are introducing a novel task, releasing a new dataset, benchmarking various models, and showing that smaller fine-tuned models can beat large models like ChatGPT and Bard on this functionality extraction task.

The paper introduces a new task of functionality extraction from Git README files, which is a form of text summarization focused on extracting the key functionalities described in the README. It releases a new dataset called FuncRead for this task. The models are evaluated using bipartite matching schemes and metrics like precision, recall and F1 score. Comparative analysis is provided between large pretrained language models like ChatGPT, Bard and smaller finetuned models on the dataset. Additional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore are also used. The motivation of the task is to aid in code refactoring to break monolith applications into microservices based on functionalities. So these are some of the key terms I identified.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called FuncRead for functionality extraction from GitHub README files. What was the motivation behind creating this new dataset and how does it differ from existing text summarization datasets?

2. The paper compares performance of fine-tuned models like CodeLlama against ChatGPT and Bard. What adaptations were made to the training procedure and prompt formulation to specialize the models for this task? 

3. The paper uses bipartite matching between generated and ground truth functionalities to evaluate models. What were the different bipartite matching schemes used and what were the rationales behind choosing them?

4. The fine-tuned models seem to outperform ChatGPT and Bard by a good margin as per results. What intrinsic capabilities of fine-tuned models could explain this performance gap?

5. The paper reports superiority of code models over NLP models. What unique characteristics of code make them more suitable for this task over generic NLP models?

6. Error analysis reveals that models tend to combine multiple functionalities into a single sentence. What modifications can be incorporated into the training strategy to mitigate this issue?

7. The paper uses a maximum token length of 2048. How can we adapt the method for very long README files without losing vital contextual information?

8. The human agreement score is fairly high indicating complexity of defining the functionality set. How can we formulate this as a well-posed problem for models to solve reliably? 

9. The paper focuses on extractive summarization. How can the models be extended for abstractive summarization of functionalities?

10. The FuncRead dataset is constructed from permissible licenses. What adaptations would be needed to handlerestricted licenses like GPL?
