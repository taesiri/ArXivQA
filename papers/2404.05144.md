## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using the Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) technique involving Quantized Low Rank Adaptation (QLoRA). Can you explain in more detail how QLoRA allows fine-tuning the language models with a minimal subset of parameters? What are the key hyperparameters used in the LoRA fine-tuning process?

2. The paper talks about using the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) technique to adapt the pre-trained language models for the task of generating discharge notes. Can you expand more on why SFT is more suitable than unsupervised pre-training for this particular task? What are some of the key hyperparameters used in the SFT method?

3. Various language models like TinyLlama, Llama2, Mistral, BioMistral etc. were evaluated in the experiments. What were some of the key differences and unique strengths between these models that made them suitable candidates for evaluation?

4. The Mistral-7B model performed the best based on the quantitative and qualitative results. In your opinion, what specific architectural or training advantages does Mistral-7B have over the other models that could have contributed to its superior performance?

5. The paper utilized both quantitative metrics (like ROUGE, BLEU, BERT Score) as well as qualitative human evaluation for assessing the discharge notes generation performance. What are some limitations of relying solely on automated quantitative metrics for evaluating medical documentation?

6. One of the limitations mentioned is the lack of standardized formatting in the input progress notes data. In your opinion, what are some pre-processing steps that could be taken to standardize or normalize the progress notes data to improve model training and performance?  

7. The paper focuses only on cardiology patientsâ€™ data for training and evaluation. What are some key challenges or differences one might face in extending this approach to other medical specialties like oncology or neurology?

8. The paper suggests exploring multi-modal approaches by incorporating medical images, lab results etc. along with text data. What kinds of multimodal fusion techniques could be promising for combining these heterogeneous data modalities? How can attention mechanisms help?

9. What are some risks associated with directly deploying automated clinical documentation systems without human approval checks? What safeguards could be implemented as part of the model pipeline?

10. What ethical considerations should be kept in mind while utilizing patient health data for developing automated clinical documentation models? How can we prevent issues like demographic bias during model development?
