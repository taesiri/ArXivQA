# [On the Resurgence of Recurrent Models for Long Sequences -- Survey and   Research Opportunities in the Transformer Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08132)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Processing very long sequences of data remains a key challenge in machine learning. Transformer models have shown outstanding performance but their quadratic complexity in sequence length is a concern. This has renewed interest in recurrent models like RNNs.  

- However, most current methods still focus on offline training on finite-length sequences. The setting of online continual learning on infinite streams of data is still largely unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper surveys recent work on the "resurgence of recurrence" for long sequence modeling. This includes Transformer variants that incorporate recurrence to improve efficiency, as well as Deep State Space Models which offer robust sequence modeling.

- The paper highlights how these trends have led to new recurrent units like the Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) that match state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

- As a case study, the paper empirically evaluates RNNs, LSTMs, convolutional models, and Transformers on a lifelong online learning task of time series forecasting.

Main Contributions:
- Provides an overview connecting recent advances in efficient Transformers, State Space Models and recurrent units. 

- Identifies online continual learning on infinite streams as a key open challenge for future recurrent models.

- Emphasizes how concepts from State Space Models can inform the design of new recurrent units like LRUs.

- Shares empirical evidence on the difficulty of online continual learning on streaming time series data.

In summary, the paper surveys the resurgence of recurrence for long sequence modeling and points to online continual learning on infinite streams as an important direction for developing more powerful and scalable sequential models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This survey discusses the recent resurgence of interest in recurrent neural networks for processing long sequences, sparked by innovations in transformer architectures and deep state space models that marry aspects of parallel processing and recurrence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a survey and discussion of the recent resurgence of recurrent neural network models for processing long sequences. The key contributions are:

1) It reviews the latest work on augmenting Transformers with recurrence to improve efficiency and long-range dependency modeling (Section 3.1). This includes linear Transformers, improvements to them, factorization approaches, and structuring recurrence.

2) It covers recent advances in deep state space models and how they connect back to recurrent nets (Section 3.2). It discusses online function approximation, learning in state space models, and variants of them. 

3) It highlights how deep state space models have inspired new recurrent units called Linear Recurrent Units (LRUs) that achieve state-of-the-art performance (Section 3.2).

4) It mentions other recent trends in recurrent models like diagonal/element-wise formulations, interleaving recurrence and convolutions, gating improvements, and ODE-inspired architectures (Section 3.3).

5) It discusses gaps and future directions around processing truly infinite-length sequences in an online continual learning setting (Sections 4 and 5), providing experimental analysis showing challenges.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a unified survey of the resurgence of recurrence for long sequence modeling, covering connections between Transformers, state space models, and recurrent nets, along with analysis of open problems in online continual learning.
