# [Mitigating Label Bias in Machine Learning: Fairness through Confident   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08749)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach to mitigate label bias and promote fairness in machine learning models. The key idea is to leverage confidence scores to identify and filter out the fairest instances from a dataset containing biased labels. Specifically, the approach trains two networks on separate subsets of the data and evaluates them on the full dataset to derive probabilistic thresholds for selecting unbiased examples. To address the limitation of relying solely on self-confidence scores, which can disadvantage underrepresented groups, the proposed method employs truncation of the scores and expands the confidence intervals of the thresholds. Additionally, it incorporates the co-teaching paradigm to further enhance the robustness and reliability of selecting fair instances across different demographic groups. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, the approach demonstrates superior performance in reducing label bias and promoting fairness compared to previous methods like confident learning, LongReMix, label correction, and group peer loss. The results show it achieves lower error rates and fairness metric violations especially as the degree of bias increases. By effectively leveraging confidence scores and co-teaching, the proposed data selection technique provides an effective way to mitigate the impact of biased labels on fairness in machine learning.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Discrimination can occur when unbiased ground truth labels are overwritten by an agent with potential bias, resulting in biased training data that unfairly harms specific groups. This causes classifiers trained on such data to inherit these biases.

- Existing methods to train fair classifiers primarily focus on modifying the model itself. There has been limited effort to directly address the root issue of biased labels in the training data. 

- Methods that try to identify label errors using confidence scores face a key challenge - instances from disadvantaged groups often have lower confidence, not due to errors but because of underrepresentation. Eliminating such instances can perpetuate unfairness.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a data selection framework, built on confident learning, that filters the fairest instances from biased training data to train classifiers.

- Adjust the confidence threshold computation to use a truncated estimator instead of the average score. This expands the confidence interval to give opportunities for fairness to lower confidence but correctly labeled instances often from disadvantaged groups.

- Incorporate co-teaching where two models are trained on separate datasets from different demographics. Fair instance selection is cross-validated to enhance robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate that despite having only biased labels, it is possible to eliminate bias and train fair classifiers through selective data filtering.

- Introduce adjustments to confident learning to address limitations in handling lower confidence instances from underrepresented groups.

- Integrate co-teaching to further improve the reliability of fair instance selection across varying demographics.

- Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of the proposed technique over existing methods in mitigating label bias and promoting fairness.
