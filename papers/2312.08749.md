## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach to mitigate label bias and promote fairness in machine learning models. The key idea is to leverage confidence scores to identify and filter out the fairest instances from a dataset containing biased labels. Specifically, the approach trains two networks on separate subsets of the data and evaluates them on the full dataset to derive probabilistic thresholds for selecting unbiased examples. To address the limitation of relying solely on self-confidence scores, which can disadvantage underrepresented groups, the proposed method employs truncation of the scores and expands the confidence intervals of the thresholds. Additionally, it incorporates the co-teaching paradigm to further enhance the robustness and reliability of selecting fair instances across different demographic groups. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, the approach demonstrates superior performance in reducing label bias and promoting fairness compared to previous methods like confident learning, LongReMix, label correction, and group peer loss. The results show it achieves lower error rates and fairness metric violations especially as the degree of bias increases. By effectively leveraging confidence scores and co-teaching, the proposed data selection technique provides an effective way to mitigate the impact of biased labels on fairness in machine learning.
