# [M3D: Advancing 3D Medical Image Analysis with Multi-Modal Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Previous research on applying multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to medical image analysis has focused primarily on 2D images. However, 3D medical images like CT scans contain richer spatial information that is useful for tasks like diagnosis, localization, and measurement. There is a need to advance 3D medical image analysis using the capabilities of modern MLLMs.

Solution:
This paper proposes M3D-LaMed, a versatile MLLM tailored for 3D medical image analysis. The key contributions are:

1. M3D-Data: A large-scale 3D multi-modal medical dataset with 120K image-text pairs and 662K instruction-response pairs covering various tasks like retrieval, question answering, positioning, and segmentation. This is the largest public dataset of its kind.

2. M3D-LaMed Model: Combines a pre-trained 3D vision encoder and efficient 3D perceiver with a large language model backbone. It handles text generation tasks like retrieval and QA as well as pioneer vision tasks like referring expression segmentation in 3D images.

3. M3D-Bench: A comprehensive benchmark with 8 tasks to quantify performance on different aspects of 3D medical image analysis. Uses both traditional metrics and LLM-based evaluation for accurate automated assessment.

Through experiments, M3D-LaMed proves to be a robust and versatile model for 3D medical image analysis, outperforming previous solutions. The public release of code, data, and models will facilitate further research into 3D medical MLLMs.
