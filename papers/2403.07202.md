# [SPAWNing Structural Priming Predictions from a Cognitively Motivated   Parser](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07202)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Structural priming is used in psycholinguistics to study mental representations of sentences, but generating predictions requires linking syntactic theories to quantitative behavioral data. 
- Existing parsers either don't model enough linguistic phenomena or don't specify priming mechanisms to generate behavioral predictions.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors introduce SPAWN, a cognitively motivated parser based on the ACT-R cognitive architecture. 
- SPAWN uses declarative memory to represent lexical and syntactic knowledge, procedural memory to combine categories, and buffers to store words/state.
- Key mechanisms like spreading activation and inhibition allow SPAWN to model priming.

Contributions:
- SPAWN can generate priming predictions from any syntactic theory using incremental parse trees. This allows evaluating which theoretical differences result in different predictions.
- The authors evaluate two competing theories of reduced relative clauses using SPAWN with different training and reanalysis settings.
- Comparing predictions to human data collected via a novel web experiment, they find only the Participial-Phase theory with weak priors matches human structural priming patterns.
- This demonstrates the utility of SPAWN in adjudicating between syntactic theories based on processing predictions.

In summary, the key innovation is SPAWN - a cognitively motivated parser that can link syntactic theories to quantitative behavioral predictions through specified mechanisms like spreading activation. The case study on reduced relative clauses showcases its ability to evaluate theories based on human priming data.
