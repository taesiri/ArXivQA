## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Developing reduced-order nonlinear models for real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) of complex chemical processes is challenging. Existing model reduction methods may not provide sufficient accuracy or integration with state estimation from limited sensors. 

Proposed Solution
- The authors propose a data-driven modelling approach based on Koopman theory to obtain low-dimensional linear and Wiener-type models with integrated state estimation from output measurements.

- They introduce a model structure combining delay-coordinate encoding of measurements for initialization and full-state decoding for prediction. This facilitates integration of estimation into model reduction.

- A deep learning framework is presented to simultaneously train the encoding, latent linear dynamics, and decoding components on measurement data.

- Extensions for output/measurement equations and linear variants are also provided.

Case Study & Results
- The method is applied to model predictive control of a high-purity cryogenic distillation column, a key unit in air separation plants.

- Wiener-type and linear Koopman models with 10 latent states are trained on simulation data from a high-fidelity nonlinear model.

- The obtained low-order models accurately reproduce complex column dynamics and enable real-time NMPC with 99% lower computational cost versus using the original model.

- Accurate setpoint tracking is achieved while satisfying quality constraints that depend on unmeasured product states.

Main Contributions
- A flexible data-driven framework for reduced-order modelling and embedded state estimation tailored to economic NMPC
- Integrated delay-embedding for model initialization from limited measurements
- Demonstrated accuracy, estimation capabilities and computational speed-up on an industrially relevant process model  

The proposed structured modelling approach enables real-time optimization and control for complex nonlinear processes by exploiting historical data. The integrated estimation features enhance robustness against incomplete measurements for high-performance control.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a data-driven model reduction approach based on Koopman theory that integrates delay-coordinate embedding for state estimation to enable real-time nonlinear model predictive control of complex chemical processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a data-driven model reduction strategy for nonlinear systems with controls based on Koopman theory. The key aspects are:

- Proposing generic model structures that combine delay-coordinate encoding of measurements and full-state decoding to integrate reduced Koopman modeling and state estimation. This allows initializing the latent Koopman coordinates from delayed measurements instead of estimating the full states.

- Presenting a deep learning approach to simultaneously train the proposed model structure, including the linear dynamics, encoding, and decoding transformations.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a case study of model predictive control of a high-purity cryogenic distillation column. The reduced Koopman models enable real-time nonlinear MPC with 99% average CPU time reduction compared to using the full model, while maintaining feasible operation and setpoint tracking performance.

In summary, the main contribution is an integrated data-driven modeling approach for reduced-order nonlinear control models with state estimation features, which is shown to enable real-time optimization and control of a complex chemical process.
