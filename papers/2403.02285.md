# [Detection of Non-recorded Word Senses in English and Swedish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02285)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dictionaries can become outdated as language evolves and new senses of words emerge or old senses become obsolete. However, manually identifying such gaps in dictionary entries is challenging for lexicographers. 
- The paper focuses on the task of automatic "Unknown Sense Detection" - determining if the meaning expressed by a particular usage of a word is missing from the dictionary entry. 
- This is difficult because dictionary entries only provide limited contextual information about word senses (e.g. a short gloss/definition, few example sentences). Standard Word Sense Disambiguation models require more training data.

Proposed Solution:
- Uses a pre-trained Word-in-Context (WiC) embedder to create vector representations of both the target word usages (from corpora) and dictionary senses. 
- Compares these vectors using similarity metrics to determine if the usage matches any recorded sense. If similarity to closest sense is below a learned threshold, predicts the usage as unassigned/unknown sense.
- Tests different sense representations (gloss, examples) and modifications (inserting headword, replacements) to deal with missing context.
- Performs human annotation on random and predicted samples to select optimal models and evaluate quality.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates automatic identification of missing dictionary senses by comparing corpus usages and limited dictionary context vectors.
- Systematically tests different contextualization techniques for representing senses from incomplete dictionary entries.
- Provides new human-annotated data for Unknown Sense Detection in English and Swedish.
- Analysis shows models can considerably increase discovery of unknown senses compared to random baseline.
- Identifies non-recorded usages that will be integrated into dictionaries. Discusses remaining challenges around headword matching.

In summary, the paper presents a novel application of Word-in-Context models to assist dictionary updating by pinpointing new and obsolete word senses in corpora. The vector comparison approach works despite limited available context and shows promising results.
