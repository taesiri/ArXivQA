# [Private PAC Learning May be Harder than Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the relationship between differentially private PAC learning and online mistake-bounded learning. Prior work showed that the Littlestone dimension, which characterizes online learnability, also characterizes sample complexity of private PAC learning. This raises the question of whether efficient online learners can be generically transformed into efficient private PAC learners. 

Main Result:  
The paper shows that under reasonable cryptographic assumptions, there exists a concept class that is efficiently online learnable with a polynomial mistake bound, but has no efficient differentially private PAC learner. This result strengthens the prior separation between efficient private and non-private PAC learning.

Key Techniques and Contributions:

- The paper introduces a new model of function-revealing encryption (FRE) that reveals a specific "floor-log distance" leakage function. This is designed to enable efficient online learning while still allowing a lower bound argument against private PAC learning.

- They identify sufficient conditions on the leakage function called the "bisection property" and "log-invariance" to achieve these goals. The bisection property enables halving-style search for online learning. Log-invariance enables argued that even a small number of example removals can totally hide interval relationships needed for PAC learning lower bound.

- They construct an explicit "floor-log distance" leakage function that satisfies both properties, enabling the separation result. The construction relies on standard assumptions used to build indistinguishability obfuscation and related primitives.

- The lower bound proof against private PAC learning is simplified from prior work by directly using differential privacy's group privacy guarantee, instead of explicitly re-identifying examples.

Overall, the paper makes conceptual contributions clarifying the relationship between online and private PAC learning, and technical contributions developing new cryptographic tools to obtain their separation result.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper shows that under reasonable cryptographic assumptions, there exists a concept class that is efficiently online learnable with a polynomial mistake bound but does not admit an efficient differentially private PAC learner, thus separating online learning from private PAC learning computationally.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is constructing a concept class that separates online learning from private PAC learning under cryptographic assumptions. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that under reasonable cryptographic assumptions (roughly functional encryption and circuit lower bounds), there exists a concept class that is efficiently online learnable with a polynomial mistake bound, but does not admit an efficient differentially private PAC learner. This strengthens a prior separation between non-private and private PAC learning due to Bun and Zhandry.

2) To achieve this separation, the paper identifies sufficient conditions on a "function-revealing encryption" scheme to enable both efficient online learning and a hardness result for private PAC. These are articulated through two key properties: the "bisection property" for online learning, and "log-invariance" for the private learning lower bound. 

3) The paper exhibits a specific "floor log distance" function revealing encryption scheme that satisfies both properties simultaneously. This scheme has a tailored leakage function that reveals certain limited information about plaintext distances/comparisons. The analysis shows this leakage enables efficient online learning via an analog of binary search, while retaining enough ambiguity to rule out an efficient differentially private PAC learner.

In summary, the main contribution is using cryptography to construct a concept class that provably separates online learning from private PAC learning, therefore showing that efficient online learnability does not generically imply efficient private PAC learnability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper defines the bisection property and log-invariance property as sufficient conditions for online learnability and hardness of private learning respectively. Can you explain intuitively why these properties enable or prevent efficient learning?

2. The online learner presented uses a variant of the halving algorithm. Can you walk through how it makes predictions and updates its state on an example? How does the bisection property factor into its mistake bound analysis? 

3. The construction of the function-revealing encryption scheme seems intricate. At a high level, can you explain the purpose and guarantees provided by each cryptographic building block it relies on? 

4. The paper argues that revealing multiplicative approximations of distances between plaintexts would allow efficient private learning, precluding a separation. Can you sketch how an exponential mechanism-based learner might work in this setting?

5. How does the paper simplify the lower bound argument against efficient private learning compared to prior work? Can you walk through the high-level ideas, especially regarding the use of group privacy? 

6. The floor-log distance leakage function is defined differently than the simpler floor of log distance. What motivated this more complex definition? How does it enable the bisection property?

7. Lemma 3 argues that random samples have certain robustness properties w.h.p. Can you explain the purpose of these technical conditions and how they are used later?  

8. The paper leaves open the possibility of weaker crypto assumptions. What approaches discussed might plausibly lead to a construction based on one-way functions?

9. How does revealing the first differing index between strings, as done in prior work, compare to the floor-log distance leakage? Why doesn't it suffice for this separation?

10. The scheme transforms single-input to multi-input functional encryption while preserving perfect correctness. At a high level, how does it achieve this? What is the purpose of the pseudorandom function used?
