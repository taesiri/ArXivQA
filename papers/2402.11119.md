# [Private PAC Learning May be Harder than Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the relationship between differentially private PAC learning and online mistake-bounded learning. Prior work showed that the Littlestone dimension, which characterizes online learnability, also characterizes sample complexity of private PAC learning. This raises the question of whether efficient online learners can be generically transformed into efficient private PAC learners. 

Main Result:  
The paper shows that under reasonable cryptographic assumptions, there exists a concept class that is efficiently online learnable with a polynomial mistake bound, but has no efficient differentially private PAC learner. This result strengthens the prior separation between efficient private and non-private PAC learning.

Key Techniques and Contributions:

- The paper introduces a new model of function-revealing encryption (FRE) that reveals a specific "floor-log distance" leakage function. This is designed to enable efficient online learning while still allowing a lower bound argument against private PAC learning.

- They identify sufficient conditions on the leakage function called the "bisection property" and "log-invariance" to achieve these goals. The bisection property enables halving-style search for online learning. Log-invariance enables argued that even a small number of example removals can totally hide interval relationships needed for PAC learning lower bound.

- They construct an explicit "floor-log distance" leakage function that satisfies both properties, enabling the separation result. The construction relies on standard assumptions used to build indistinguishability obfuscation and related primitives.

- The lower bound proof against private PAC learning is simplified from prior work by directly using differential privacy's group privacy guarantee, instead of explicitly re-identifying examples.

Overall, the paper makes conceptual contributions clarifying the relationship between online and private PAC learning, and technical contributions developing new cryptographic tools to obtain their separation result.
