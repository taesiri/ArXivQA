# [FreestyleRet: Retrieving Images from Style-Diversified Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02428)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new image retrieval task called Style-Diversified Query-Based Image Retrieval, which aims to retrieve relevant images based on queries with diverse styles such as text, sketches, art, and low-resolution images. To facilitate research in this area, the authors construct a Diverse-Style Retrieval dataset containing 10,000 images along with corresponding text, sketch, art, and low-resolution queries. They also propose a lightweight retrieval framework called FreestyleRet which extracts textural and style features from the queries using a Gram matrix and clustered style space. These features are then fed into a style-init prompt tuning module on top of a visual encoder to enable adaptation to various query styles. Experiments demonstrate superior performance of FreestyleRet over existing retrieval models on handling diverse query styles. Key advantages are the ability to simultaneously retrieve multiple query types which mutually boost performance, lightweight and plug-and-play architecture, and state-of-the-art accuracy on the new Diverse-Style Retrieval dataset. Overall, this paper addresses an important gap in current image retrieval research concerning diversity of user queries.
