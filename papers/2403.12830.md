# [Has Approximate Machine Unlearning been evaluated properly? From   Auditing to Side Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12830)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine unlearning is important for allowing users to remove their data from ML models to protect privacy. But evaluating if unlearning methods actually remove data influence is challenging.
- Approximate unlearning methods are complex, making it hard to directly audit if data is deleted. Metrics focusing on model performance miss privacy violations. 
- Existing membership inference attacks for evaluation have different goals from unlearning auditing. They focus on detecting membership rather than absence.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper frames auditing unlearning as a non-membership inference problem, simplifying the evaluation.
- Two black-box auditing scores are introduced - Likelihood Difference (L-Diff) and Difference Likelihood (D-Liks) based on model outputs.
- These leverage outputs for non-member data between original and unlearned models to quantify unlearning, no retraining needed.

Contributions:
- Validation shows the scores effectively audit unlearning without retraining models.
- Analysis of 7 algorithms using the scores uncovers limitations in utility, resilience (handling multiple unlearning), and equity (variation in unlearning difficulty).
- Issues like the privacy onion effect where unlearning certain data impacts past unlearning are highlighted.
- The scores and framework allow more nuanced understanding of approximate unlearning methods beyond just performance metrics.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions by advancing unlearning auditing to uncover granular insights on utility and unintended effects, providing an important perspective for improving real-world efficacy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces effective black-box auditing metrics to evaluate approximate machine unlearning algorithms, uncovers issues with utility, resilience, and equity in current methods, and advocates for standardized evaluation to ensure algorithms properly forget data as required.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Enhanced Sample-Level Auditing Techniques: The paper proposes effective auditing methods for sample-level black-box unlearning, framing it as a non-membership inference challenge. This allows for a thorough analysis of how individual samples are unlearned without needing to train additional shadow models.

2) Analysis of Unlearning Resilience: The paper explores how black-box models react to multiple successive unlearning requests, focusing on the effect on previous unlearning results. It also examines the relationship between unlearning resilience and memory correlation.

3) Advocating Equity in Machine Unlearning: The proposed evaluation metric highlights variations in unlearning effectiveness, distinguishing it from conventional fairness notions in machine learning. This points to the necessity for equitable unlearning processes and impartial auditing results.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing well-defined and effective metrics for black-box unlearning auditing to improve understanding of approximate machine unlearning methods. The analysis identifies issues around utility, resilience and equity that need to be addressed.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Machine unlearning - The core focus of the paper, referring to methods for removing or minimizing the influence of specific data from trained machine learning models.

- Auditing - A major theme, the paper looks at auditing techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of approximate machine unlearning methods in forgetting data. 

- Non-membership inference - The paper frames auditing unlearning as a non-membership inference challenge rather than a traditional membership inference attack.

- Metrics - The paper introduces new metrics like Likelihood's Difference Score and Difference's Likelihood Score for quantifying unlearning at an individual sample level in a black-box setting.

- Utility - One aspect explored is the utility of different unlearning algorithms in forgetting varied types of data.

- Resilience - The paper analyzes how multiple successive unlearning requests impact previously "forgotten" data. 

- Equity - Another dimension studied is the equality of unlearning outcomes across different classes or sample groups.

So in summary, key terms cover machine unlearning, auditing, metrics, utility, resilience, and equity in the context of evaluating approximate unlearning techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does framing approximate machine unlearning auditing as a non-membership inference problem simplify the audit process compared to membership inference attacks? What are the key differences in assumptions between the two frameworks?

2. Explain in detail how the Likelihood's Difference Score and Difference's Likelihood Score auditing metrics work. How do they leverage outputs from the original and unlearned models to estimate non-membership? 

3. The paper argues that direct analysis of model outputs is more effective for auditing than methods relying on shadow models like LiRA. Elaborate on why this is the case and the relative limitations of shadow model approaches.  

4. What trends were observed in the auditability of the three types of unlearning tasks tested (random sample, partial class, total class)? How did the metrics' effectiveness vary across these scenarios and why?

5. How was the concept of privacy onion introduced in analyzing the resilience of unlearning methods to successive requests? What implications does this have on the long-term robustness evaluation of algorithms?

6. Describe what is meant by unlearning equity and how it was assessed across different classes. Were there clear patterns linking equity issues to specific datasets or algorithms?

7. What risks are introduced by utilizing non-membership inference for unlearning audits? Discuss the privacy concerns and how methods like temporal delays or differential privacy could help mitigate such issues.  

8. Pick one of the 7 unlearning algorithms analyzed, and critique its strengths and weaknesses in terms of utility, resilience and equity based on the experimental results.

9. How well did the evaluation framework address limitations around balancing computational efficiency and utility? What refinements could further improve assessments of real-world efficacy?

10. Discuss the broader impacts of standardized evaluation practices for approximate machine unlearning methods. What positive ripple effects could more measured, nuanced analysis enable?
