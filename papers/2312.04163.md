## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel multi-scale residual transformer (MSRT) model for effectively classifying Very Low Frequency (VLF) lightning signals. Accurately classifying lightning signals is crucial for reducing interference and noise in VLF communication systems. While traditional statistical and CNN-based methods have limitations in discerning multi-scale features and sequence dependencies, MSRT adopts a multi-scale residual module to capture intricate patterns at different scales. It also incorporates a transformer encoder to leverage long-range temporal correlations. Using a 10-class open dataset, MSRT achieves 90% classification accuracy and outperforms CNN and transformer baselines, demonstrating its capabilities in fusing multi-scale local features and modeling global sequential dependencies. Five-fold cross-validation further validates its robustness. Overall, this innovative integration of multi-scale learning and self-attention mechanisms in MSRT advances VLF lightning signal analysis, paving the way for improved lightning localization and communication reliability. The promising results highlight the potential of applying MSRT for a comprehensive characterization of lightning events.
