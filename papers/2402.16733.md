# [DREsS: Dataset for Rubric-based Essay Scoring on EFL Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automated essay scoring (AES) systems can provide useful real-time feedback to students and instructors in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) writing education. 
- However, previous AES models and datasets have limitations:
   - Most only provide a single holistic score, lacking analytic rubric-based scores preferred for EFL writing assessment.
   - Existing rubric-based datasets use inconsistent rubrics or scores from non-experts, limiting their usability.
   - There is a lack of standard datasets relevant to practical EFL scenarios with scores from writing education experts.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors release DREsS, a large-scale standard dataset for rubric-based AES with scores from EFL writing experts. DREsS has 3 components:
   - DREsS_New: 1,782 essays from EFL undergrads with scores from instructors.
   - DREsS_Std: 6,516 existing essays standardized to consistent rubrics.  
   - DREsS_CASE: 20,601 synthetic samples generated through a proposed corruption-based data augmentation method.
- The authors standardize 3 existing datasets to 3 key rubrics: content, organization, language.
- A corruption-based augmentation strategy (CASE) creates synthetic samples by introducing different types of errors based on the rubrics. 

Main Contributions:  
- Release of DREsS, the first large-scale standard dataset for rubric-based AES relevant to EFL scenarios, with expert annotations.
- Standardization of existing datasets to consistent rubrics to better leverage these datasets.
- A corruption-based data augmentation strategy that improves performance of rubric-based AES models by 45.44%.
- DREsS facilitates further research into more accurate and practical AES systems for EFL writing education.
