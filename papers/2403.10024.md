# [MR-MT3: Memory Retaining Multi-Track Music Transcription to Mitigate   Instrument Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10024)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Automatic music transcription (AMT) aims to convert audio signals to musical scores. Current state-of-the-art model MT3 has issues with "instrument leakage", where notes are fragmented across instruments in the transcription. 

- MT3 processes audio in segments so loses inter-segment musical context, leading to discontinuous transcriptions. Evaluation metrics focus only on transcription accuracy, not coherence of instrumentation.

Proposed Solution 
- The authors propose MR-MT3 to enhance MT3 using:
   1) A memory retention mechanism to retain contextual tokens from past segments to inform future transcriptions
   2) Prior token sampling to train the memory using segments from more flexible time horizons  
   3) Token shuffling during training for better generalization

- They introduce new metrics for evaluating transcription quality:
   1) Instrument leakage ratio to quantify fragmentation
   2) Instrument detection F1 score for accuracy of predicted instruments

Results
- Experiments conducted by training from scratch and continual training show proposed methods improve onset F1 scores and instrument detection while reducing leakage. 

- Analysis of domain overfitting reveals difficulties adapting models trained on complex multi-instrument datasets to simpler single instrument datasets.

Main Contributions
- Memory retention mechanism to capture musical context across segments
- Techniques like prior token sampling and token shuffling to improve MT3
- New evaluation metrics for assessing transcription quality factors beyond accuracy
- Analysis showing complex transcription models struggle on simpler test domains  

In summary, the authors identify and address shortcomings of MT3 for multi-instrument AMT, propose new training strategies and evaluation metrics to mitigate these issues, and highlight overfitting challenges that remain open for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes enhancements to the token-based multi-instrument automatic music transcription model MT3, including a memory retention mechanism, prior token sampling, and token shuffling, to improve transcription quality by increasing onset F1 scores and instrument detection F1 scores while mitigating instrument leakage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing enhancements to the MT3 model to mitigate the issue of instrument leakage, where musical notes leak across multiple instruments in the transcription. The enhancements include:

- A memory retention mechanism to aggregate representations from past segments to inform the transcription of the current segment. This helps to capture long-term musical context.

- Prior token sampling, where during training, the past segments used for memory retention can be sampled from a flexible time period in the past, not just the immediate past segment. 

- Token shuffling as a data augmentation technique.

2) Evaluating the proposed methods by training from scratch and continual training from the MT3 checkpoint. The methods are shown to be effective at improving multi-instrument transcription onset F1 scores, instrument detection F1 scores, and reducing instrument leakage ratio.

3) Investigating the issue of domain overfitting in multi-instrument transcription models, where models trained on complex multi-instrument datasets struggle to generalize to simpler single-instrument datasets. The study shows training with both mixtures and stems can alleviate overfitting.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing enhancements to the MT3 model to improve multi-instrument transcription quality and mitigate instrument leakage.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The memory retention mechanism in MR-MT3 aims to capture long-term musical context across audio segments. How does the specific design of this mechanism, such as the use of self-attention and aggregated token representations, achieve this objective? 

2. Prior token sampling provides flexibility in using tokens from more distant past segments as context for the current segment. What is the intuition behind allowing increased temporal distance for sampling prior tokens instead of using only the immediate past segment?

3. What are the trade-offs between using a larger vs smaller value for the hyperparameter L_agg which determines the length of the aggregated memory representation? How would this impact model performance and efficiency?

4. Token shuffling introduces greater token order diversity during training. In addition to the demonstrated gains, what other potential benefits could this data augmentation strategy confer to the model in terms of musical sequence understanding?  

5. The memory retention mechanism requires ground truth labels during training. How can this limitation be addressed at inference time when ground truth labels are unavailable? What alternative approaches can be explored?

6. Instrument leakage ratio and instrument detection F1 score are proposed as new evaluation metrics. How do these metrics capture quality aspects that the transcription F1 score does not measure? Why is considering them important?

7. The experiments reveal a trade-off between onset F1 and instrument detection metrics. What are some hypotheses that can explain this behavior and how can future research be directed to overcome this trade-off?

8. What inferences can be made about MT3's generalization capacity based on the suboptimal performance on simpler monophonic datasets? How do the results with audio stems augmentation provide insights into why this issue occurs?  

9. The techniques used simultaneously appear to over-regularize the model leading to lower F1 scores on simpler datasets. What modifications can be tested to find the right balance between regularization and transcription quality?

10. How do you foresee the proposed ideas being extended or adapted to build better token-based models beyond the MT3 architecture? What are other longer-term possibilities for this transcription paradigm?
