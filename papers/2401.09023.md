# [Explain Thyself Bully: Sentiment Aided Cyberbullying Detection with   Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cyberbullying has become a major issue with the rise of social media. Existing work has focused on detecting cyberbullying in monolingual data with traditional machine learning and deep learning models. However, there is very little work on detecting cyberbullying in code-mixed languages commonly used on social media.
- Moreover, with new laws like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that gives users the "right to explanation", there is a need for interpretable models rather than just focusing on performance. Explainable AI models help build trust and transparency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops the first explainable cyberbullying detection model for code-mixed Hindi-English text. They also identify targets of bullying.
- A new benchmark dataset "BullyExplain" is created by annotating rationales (text fragments that justify classification), sentiment, target groups (religion, sexual-orientation etc.) in existing BullySent dataset.
- A multitask neural network mExCB is proposed to detect cyberbullying, sentiment, rationales and targets simultaneously. It uses CNN and BiGRU for feature extraction at word and sub-sentence level along with attention mechanisms.

Key Contributions:
- First explainable cyberbullying detection dataset and model for code-mixed text
- Identification of targets of cyberbullying
- Multitask neural network mExCB that jointly performs 4 tasks - cyberbullying detection, sentiment analysis, rationale detection and target identification
- Experiments show improved performance over baselines and state of the art methods. Rationales and sentiment information aid cyberbullying detection.

In summary, the paper develops an explainable multitask model for detecting cyberbullying and identifying targets in code-mixed social media text to promote transparency and trustworthiness. The benchmark dataset and analyses are valuable for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes the first explainable cyberbullying detection technique in code-mixed language by developing a multi-task deep learning framework and a new benchmark dataset annotated with rationales, sentiment labels, and targets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Developing the first explainable cyberbully detection dataset in code-mixed language where rationales/phrases used for decision making are annotated along with bully label, sentiment label and target label. 

2. Proposing a multitask framework called mExCB based on word and sub-sentence label attention to simultaneously solve four tasks - Bully detection, Sentiment analysis, Rationales detection, and Target identification. 

3. Showing that the proposed mExCB model outperforms all the baselines and state-of-the-art approaches on cyberbullying detection, with an accuracy improvement of 2.19%.

So in summary, the key contributions are around creating a new benchmark dataset for explainable cyberbullying detection in code-mixed languages, and developing a novel multitask neural framework that leverages this data to achieve improved performance on the main task of cyberbullying detection. The integration of explainability through rationale detection is a key aspect.

The paper focuses on developing an explainable cyberbullying detection system for code-mixed languages. Key ideas include using rationales (text fragments that justify decisions) to make the model more interpretable, incorporating sentiment analysis to improve detection, identifying targets of bullying, and formulating the tasks in a multitask learning framework. The model architecture uses CNNs, GRUs, and attention to process the text data. A new benchmark dataset called BullyExplain is introduced containing annotations for cyberbullying, rationales, sentiment, and targets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a multitask framework called mExCB for explainable cyberbullying detection. What are the four tasks that mExCB aims to solve simultaneously and how does solving them together help improve performance on the main task of cyberbullying detection?

2. The paper introduces a new dataset called BullyExplain. What types of annotations does this dataset have and how were the rationale annotations created through a multi-stage training process with experts and novice annotators? 

3. The mExCB model utilizes both CNNs and GRUs at the word and sub-sentence levels. What is the intuition behind using these two types of neural networks and having representations at multiple levels of granularity?

4. Attention mechanisms are incorporated in mExCB. At what points are the self-attention layers added and do they operate on the word or sub-sentence representations? What is the purpose of the attention mechanism?

5. Loss functions play an important role in multitask learning. How is the overall loss function structured in mExCB across the multiple tasks and what is the Î² hyperparameter used for?

6. Both BERT and VecMap embeddings are experimented with as inputs to mExCB. Why might BERT embeddings lead to better performance compared to VecMap in this code-mixed setting?

7. The paper analyzes model performance through several research questions. What did they find about the effect of multitasking and which task combinations work best? How does mExCB compare to only using CNN or only GRU models?

8. Why is directly fine-tuning BERT not as effective as using frozen BERT embeddings and adding separate neural architecture components in mExCB? What hypothesis do the authors have for why that is the case?

9. How does the performance of mExCB with 2 tasks compare to prior state-of-the-art results? What additional gains are achieved by incorporating the rationales detection task as an auxiliary task?

10. What issues does the error analysis reveal about how well the models can generate valid rationales compared to human annotations? What future work do the authors propose to improve explanation quality?
