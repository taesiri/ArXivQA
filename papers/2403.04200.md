# [ACC-ViT : Atrous Convolution's Comeback in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04200)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision transformer (ViT) attention mechanisms fall into two categories - regional attention and sparse attention. Regional attention preserves hierarchical relations between image regions but has limited global context. Sparse attention can capture global context but loses local hierarchical information. There is a tradeoff between these two types of attention.

- Atrous/dilated convolution can adaptively adjust receptive field to capture multi-scale context, but has not been explored much for vision transformers.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new Atrous Attention mechanism that fuses regional and sparse attention concepts inspired by atrous convolution. Uses multiple windows with varying dilation rates to compute attention hierarchically.

- Design a hybrid ViT model called ACC-ViT with the following components:
   1) Atrous Attention blocks
   2) Parallel atrous inverted residual convolution blocks 
   3) Adaptive gating to fuse different branches
   4) Shared MLP layer across parallel attentions

- Overall ACC-ViT captures both local hierarchical patterns and global context in a balanced manner.

Main Contributions:
- Novel Atrous Attention mechanism for vision transformers
- ACC-ViT hybrid architecture using Atrous Attention and other proposed blocks
- ACC-ViT outperforms state-of-the-art ViTs like MaxViT on ImageNet while using less parameters
- Demonstrated versatility of ACC-ViT via fine-tuning, linear probing and zero-shot evaluations
- Competitive performance even when scaled down, suitable for niche applications

In summary, the paper introduced a new attention concept and ViT model design that achieves better balance between local and global context by building on ideas from atrous convolution. Both attention and convolution blocks are redesigned accordingly.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new attention mechanism for vision transformers called Atrous Attention, which fuses regional and sparse attention inspired by atrous convolution, and develops a hybrid vision transformer architecture named ACC-ViT that outperforms state-of-the-art models like MaxViT and MOAT on image classification while also showing strong performance on other vision tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new attention mechanism for vision transformers called "Atrous Attention". Specifically:

- It fuses concepts from regional attention (which preserves hierarchical relations) and sparse attention (which captures global context) by taking inspiration from atrous/dilated convolutions. 

- It computes attention over input images/features at multiple levels of dilation and combines them to consolidate both local and global information.

- Based on this Atrous Attention, the paper proposes a hybrid vision transformer backbone called ACC-ViT which outperforms state-of-the-art models like MaxViT and MOAT on ImageNet image classification.

- The paper also designs the model architecture and components like convolution blocks based on principles of atrous convolutions.

- It demonstrates ACC-ViT's versatility across tasks like transfer learning on medical images, object detection feature extraction, and zero-shot learning.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel Atrous Attention mechanism and the ACC-ViT vision transformer backbone that builds on this attention to achieve strong performance across multiple computer vision tasks.
