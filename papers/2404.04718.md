# [Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Cardiovascular Hemodynamics   Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Heart failure is a major health issue globally. Elevated Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure (PAWP) indicates impaired cardiac function and risk of heart failure. 
- Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard for assessing PAWP but is invasive. Non-invasive methods are needed to screen high-risk patients.
- Prior works utilize single-modality data. Multimodal learning can improve performance by fusing complementary data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops an interpretable multimodal learning pipeline to predict PAWP by fusing features from cardiac MRI (CMR) scans and electronic health records (EHRs).

- Two CMR sequences are used: short-axis and four-chamber view. Tensor-based features are extracted using Multilinear PCA. 

- A graph attention network selects important EHR features by modeling patient relationships.

- Four fusion strategies are proposed: early, intermediate, late and hybrid fusion. The pipeline uses SVM classifier.

Main Contributions:
- Propose interpretable multimodal pipeline fusing CMR imaging features and EHR data
- Design graph attention network for EHR feature selection 
- Implement four fusion techniques: early, intermediate, late and hybrid 
- Uncertainty-based sample filtering to improve model quality
- Test pipeline on large dataset of 2,641 patients from ASPIRE registry
- Comparative study shows superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Decision curve analysis validates clinical utility.
- Achieve fine model interpretability and identify clinically relevant high-risk features

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in developing an interpretable multimodal learning pipeline for PAWP prediction that fuses Cardiac MRI and EHR data and demonstrates its effectiveness on a large real-world dataset.
