# [Hashmarks: Privacy-Preserving Benchmarks for High-Stakes AI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00645)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a protocol called "hashmarking" to enable evaluating sensitive capabilities in AI systems like language models without disclosing hazardous information. The key idea is that instead of publishing correct answers to test questions in cleartext, the answers are first cryptographically hashed in an irreversible way. Developers can then test their models by checking if their predicted answers hash to the same values as the reference hashes, verifying capability without seeing the actual answers. The protocol employs techniques like slow hashing, salting answers with questions, and consensus filtering to improve security. While not impervious, hashmarks raise the difficulty for bad actors to acquire dangerous knowledge through these evaluations. The paper discusses limitations and failure modes like brute-force cracking attempts, as well as suggests further modifications like stakes skewness and multi-stage evaluations. Overall hashmarks represent initial progress towards securely quantifying capabilities in sensitive AI domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a protocol called "hashmarking" for evaluating sensitive capabilities in AI systems through encrypted benchmarks, enabling knowledge verification while preventing full knowledge acquisition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing hashmarking, a protocol for evaluating capabilities in AI systems related to sensitive topics without disclosing the reference solutions. Specifically, the paper:

1) Introduces the concept of a hashmark, which is a benchmark where the reference solutions have been hashed prior to publication. This allows third parties to verify their knowledge on a sensitive topic by attempting to reproduce the hashes, while preventing them from acquiring new knowledge by concealing the actual solutions. 

2) Documents the hashmarking protocol, which involves experts contributing question-answer pairs, hashing the answers, and filtering the pairs based on consensus. The filtered collection of questions and hashed answers can then be published to enable knowledge verification while hindering knowledge acquisition.

3) Analyzes the security properties of hashmarks against various attacks like brute-force, rainbow tables, and novel failure modes unique to advanced AI systems. It also discusses limitations and potential directions for making hashmarks more secure.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing hashmarks as a way to evaluate dual-use AI capabilities confidentially, while enabling some degree of verification and oversight. The analysis of the security tradeoffs involved is also a key contribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Hashmarks - The proposed protocol for creating privacy-preserving benchmarks to evaluate sensitive AI capabilities without disclosing reference solutions.

- Dual-use research - Research that has both beneficial civilian applications as well as potentially harmful or dangerous applications, such as bioterrorism or cyberwarfare. Assessing capabilities in these areas poses challenges.

- Cryptographic hashing - Using cryptographic hash functions like Argon2 to hash reference solutions. This allows capabilities to be verified without exposing sensitive details.

- Rainbow table attacks - A type of attack the protocol aims to protect against by using salted hashing. 

- Slow hashing - Intentionally compute-intensive hashing algorithms used to mitigate brute force attacks.

- Attention hazards - The risk of drawing unwanted attention to sensitive topics by referencing them, even without disclosing details.

- Knowledge verification - Allowing third parties to verify the extent of a model's knowledge on a sensitive topic without enabling knowledge acquisition.

In summary, the key focus is on privacy-preserving evaluation of AI capabilities on sensitive dual-use topics using cryptographic techniques like salted slow hashing.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the hashmarking method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using cryptographic accumulators as a potential technique to only disclose the number of correct answers without indicating which ones. Can you elaborate on how cryptographic accumulators could be integrated into the hashmarking protocol? What are some of the challenges? 

2. The hashmarking protocol relies on experts articulating obscure yet unambiguous questions with narrow answers. What might be some strategies for generating high-quality questions satisfying these desiderata across diverse sensitive topics?

3. The paper argues that the computational expense associated with hashmark creation and verification can mitigate certain attacks. What might be reasonable benchmarks or guidelines when it comes to defining what constitutes "prohibitively expensive" in this context?

4. The protocol attempts to balance security against bad actors with enabling legitimate evaluation of capabilities. Can you conceptualize some ways one might more formally quantify this tradeoff? What metrics could be used?

5. The paper mentions the possibility of using zero-knowledge proofs to prevent misreporting of results. What might a basic scheme for employing zero-knowledge proofs look like in the context of certifying performance on a hashmark?

6. The protocol relies solely on obscuring answers to prevent knowledge acquisition. Can you think of modifications where questions would also be obfuscated? What are some challenges associated with obfuscating questions?

7. How might the staging of hashmarks balance security with usability? For instance, what would a multi-stage scheme look like and what would determine progression from one stage to the next?

8. The paper argues hashmarks could replicate properties of password hashes to mitigate attention hazards. What might a concrete scheme look like for artificially inducing a skewed distribution of sensitivities? 

9. Are there scenarios you can think of where it would be acceptable to disclose cleartext answers, while still preventing misuse? What protections could be put in place?

10. Can you conceptualize additional techniques from cryptography or federated learning that could augment hashmarks to make them more secure or practical? What would be some concrete ways of integrating those techniques?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
There is a need to evaluate AI capabilities on sensitive topics like bioterrorism without publicly disclosing dangerous information. Traditional QA benchmarks publish reference solutions, enabling misuse. Closed evaluations reduce transparency and could stifle progress.  

Solution - Hashmarks:
The paper proposes hashmarks - benchmarks where reference solutions are hashed prior to publication. Developers can test model accuracy by hashing their solutions the same way and checking if they match. This enables evaluation without disclosing sensitive information.

Key Details:
- Experts provide question-answer pairs, hash answers using questions as salt 
- Auditor filters question-answer pairs, publishes questions and hashed answers
- Models tested by hashing solutions the same way and checking if hashes match
- Uses slow hashing and salting to prevent brute force and rainbow table attacks
- Aims to balance evaluation and security, not make perfect security guarantees

Contributions:  
- Identifies need for secure evaluation protocols on sensitive topics
- Proposes hashmarks as a novel approach to address this need 
- Analyzes security properties and failure modes unique to language models
- Discusses techniques to balance security vs. evaluation quality

The paper makes an important contribution in formalizing the concept of hashmarks to enable AI evaluation on sensitive topics in a privacy-preserving way. It thoughtfully analyzes the security trade-offs involved.
