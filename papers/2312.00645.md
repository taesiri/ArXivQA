# [Hashmarks: Privacy-Preserving Benchmarks for High-Stakes AI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00645)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a protocol called "hashmarking" to enable evaluating sensitive capabilities in AI systems like language models without disclosing hazardous information. The key idea is that instead of publishing correct answers to test questions in cleartext, the answers are first cryptographically hashed in an irreversible way. Developers can then test their models by checking if their predicted answers hash to the same values as the reference hashes, verifying capability without seeing the actual answers. The protocol employs techniques like slow hashing, salting answers with questions, and consensus filtering to improve security. While not impervious, hashmarks raise the difficulty for bad actors to acquire dangerous knowledge through these evaluations. The paper discusses limitations and failure modes like brute-force cracking attempts, as well as suggests further modifications like stakes skewness and multi-stage evaluations. Overall hashmarks represent initial progress towards securely quantifying capabilities in sensitive AI domains.
