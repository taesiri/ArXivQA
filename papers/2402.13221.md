# [CHILI: Chemically-Informed Large-scale Inorganic Nanomaterials Dataset   for Advancing Graph Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph machine learning (ML) methods have shown great progress on modeling small organic molecules, but modeling inorganic materials and nanomaterials poses new challenges due to their periodicity, symmetry, and variable size/scale. 
- Generative modeling of graphs is also an open challenge, especially for generating chemically valid structures at scale.
- There is a lack of large-scale nanomaterial graph datasets to facilitate development of methods to address these challenges.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a chemically-informed approach to generate two large-scale nanomaterial graph datasets - CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K
- CHILI-3K: 3,180 graphs of mono-metallic oxide nanoparticles generated from 12 crystal types, medium-scale (>6M nodes, >49M edges)
- CHILI-100K: 104,408 graphs generated from experimentally determined structures in COD database, large-scale (>183M nodes, >1.2B edges) 
- Define 11 property prediction tasks (node, edge, graph-level) and 6 structure prediction tasks using simulated scattering data
- Benchmark performance of 7 GNN models on prediction and generation tasks 

Main Contributions:
- First open-source nanomaterial graph datasets of this scale capturing structural diversity
- Chemically-informed graph generation pipeline incorporating domain knowledge
- Well-defined set of property prediction and structure generation tasks 
- Extensive benchmarking of GNN methods forms useful baseline for future research
- Identify open challenges for graph ML community - symmetry, periodicity, generative modeling at scale for nanomaterials

The datasets and tasks are intended to drive progress at intersection of graph ML and inorganic nanomaterial modeling by engaging the community to develop specialized methods addressing the open challenges.
