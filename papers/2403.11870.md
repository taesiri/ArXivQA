# [IDF-CR: Iterative Diffusion Process for Divide-and-Conquer Cloud Removal   in Remote-sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Optical remote sensing images are often obscured by clouds, limiting their utility for applications like environmental monitoring. Removing clouds from these images remains a challenging problem. 
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise for cloud removal, but have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) also face difficulties with generator-discriminator convergence.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an Iterative Diffusion Process for Divide-and-Conquer Cloud Removal (IDF-CR). It consists of two stages:
   1) Pixel Space Cloud Removal Module (Pixel-CR): Uses a Swin transformer architecture to perform initial coarse cloud removal. A cloudy attention module provides guidance on cloud locations.
   2) Iterative Noise Diffusion (IND) Module: Transforms the image to latent space using VQ-VAE encoder. Applies diffusion model for refinement, using ControlNet to maintain generation capability and a proposed Iterative Noise Refinement (INR) method to enhance noise prediction.

Main Contributions:
- First work to apply diffusion models for remote sensing cloud removal. Proposes a divide-and-conquer approach that leverages pixel space transformer and latent space diffusion model.
- Introduces cloudy attention module to guide feature extraction for cloud removal.
- Proposes iterative noise refinement method to improve diffusion model's noise prediction and enhance visual quality.

Experiments:
- Testing on RICE and WHUS2-CRv datasets shows IDF-CR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on quantitative metrics.
- Qualitative results also demonstrate more effective cloud removal and detail reconstruction.
- Ablations validate contributions of the pixel space cloud removal module, iterative noise refinement, and cloudy attention.

In summary, the paper pioneers a transformer+diffusion approach for cloud removal that pushes state-of-the-art on standard datasets. The introduced techniques for guiding attention and refining noise show promise for further diffusion model applications.
