# [Prioritized Unit Propagation with Periodic Resetting is (Almost) All You   Need for Random SAT Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05906)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:Can a simple algorithm based on prioritized unit propagation and periodic resetting perform surprisingly well on random SAT instances from recent SAT competitions?The key points are:- The paper proposes a simple SAT solving algorithm called PUPPER (Prioritized Unit Propagation with Periodic Resetting) that combines prioritized unit propagation and periodic resetting. - Unit propagation is a fundamental component of CDCL solvers, but has not been explored much in local search. The paper adapts unit propagation to work on full assignments rather than partial assignments.- The ordering of variables for propagation is prioritized based on the variance of their assignments. Periodic resetting to the best assignment so far is used to avoid getting stuck.- The main hypothesis is that despite its simplicity, PUPPER can perform surprisingly well on random SAT competition benchmarks.- Experiments show PUPPER solves comparable number of instances as the 2nd place solver in the random track of SAT competitions 2017 and 2018, using just a single thread.- This suggests unit propagation is a powerful technique that deserves more attention, and the existing random benchmarks may not be challenging enough.In summary, the paper explores whether a simple SAT solver based purely on unit propagation can perform well on standard random benchmarks, which is indeed shown to be the case. The simplicity yet effectiveness of the algorithm is the main surprise and takeaway.
