# [Prioritized Unit Propagation with Periodic Resetting is (Almost) All You   Need for Random SAT Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05906)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:Can a simple algorithm based on prioritized unit propagation and periodic resetting perform surprisingly well on random SAT instances from recent SAT competitions?The key points are:- The paper proposes a simple SAT solving algorithm called PUPPER (Prioritized Unit Propagation with Periodic Resetting) that combines prioritized unit propagation and periodic resetting. - Unit propagation is a fundamental component of CDCL solvers, but has not been explored much in local search. The paper adapts unit propagation to work on full assignments rather than partial assignments.- The ordering of variables for propagation is prioritized based on the variance of their assignments. Periodic resetting to the best assignment so far is used to avoid getting stuck.- The main hypothesis is that despite its simplicity, PUPPER can perform surprisingly well on random SAT competition benchmarks.- Experiments show PUPPER solves comparable number of instances as the 2nd place solver in the random track of SAT competitions 2017 and 2018, using just a single thread.- This suggests unit propagation is a powerful technique that deserves more attention, and the existing random benchmarks may not be challenging enough.In summary, the paper explores whether a simple SAT solver based purely on unit propagation can perform well on standard random benchmarks, which is indeed shown to be the case. The simplicity yet effectiveness of the algorithm is the main surprise and takeaway.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple but surprisingly effective SAT solving algorithm called "prioritized unit propagation with periodic resetting (PUPPER)". The key ideas are:- Prioritized unit propagation: Extend standard unit propagation to work on full assignments rather than just partial assignments, by iteratively assigning variables in a priority order and running unit propagation after each assignment. The variable priorities are based on the variance of the variable's value across PUP iterations.- Periodic resetting: Periodically reset the assignment back to the best assignment found so far, to avoid getting stuck in local optima. The paper shows that PUPPER ranks 2nd place on the random tracks of the 2017 and 2018 SAT Competition, even beating much more complex SAT solvers. This suggests that iterative unit propagation with some simple heuristics like prioritization and resetting can be very powerful for SAT solving on random instances. The main contributions are:- Proposing the simple but effective PUPPER algorithm for SAT solving- Showing its strong performance on standard SAT competition benchmarks, demonstrating the surprising effectiveness of iterative unit propagation.- Suggesting the need for more challenging random benchmarks, since PUPPER solves most existing ones.- Highlighting that variations of unit propagation deserve more exploration in SAT solvers.So in summary, the paper makes the simple but powerful observation that iterative unit propagation with basic heuristics is sufficient to achieve highly competitive SAT solving performance on many standard benchmarks. This highlights the need for more challenging benchmarks and more exploration of unit propagation in SAT solvers.
