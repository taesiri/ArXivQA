# [Enhancing Kinship Verification through Multiscale Retinex and Combined   Deep-Shallow features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03562)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an innovative kinship verification system that fuses deep and shallow facial image features to reliably ascertain biological relationships between individuals. The methodology integrates a Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) preprocessing technique to enhance image quality and contrast. For feature extraction, Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) descriptors capture shallow texture details while the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model extracts profound facial attributes. These complementary features are combined at the score level using Logistic Regression fusion, capitalizing on their synergies. Additional optimizations are made through tensor subspace feature transformations using the robust TXQDA+WCCN algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on three renowned kinship datasets - Cornell Kin Face, UB Kin Face and TS Kin Face - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The proposed system achieves outstanding accuracy rates up to 95.18%, underscoring the viability of fusing deep and shallow visual features with advanced subspace methods for reliable facial image-based kinship verification, even for challenging real world scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an enhanced kinship verification system through integrating Multiscale Retinex image preprocessing, fusion of deep CNN and local texture features, and multilinear subspace projection, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on three benchmark datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of an advanced preprocessing method called Multiscale Retinex (MSR) that significantly enhances color restoration and overall image quality for kinship verification. Experiments show direct improvements in outcomes due to using MSR.

2) The use of robust TXQDA+WCCN algorithm for subspace projection and dimensionality reduction, which emphasizes multidimensional data representation. 

3) Refinement of the feature extraction process through score-level fusion using Logistic Regression (LR). This fuses the shallow texture features of LPQ with profound features from the pretrained VGG16 model, leveraging the synergies between these attributes to achieve superior kinship verification performance.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of MSR preprocessing, TXQDA+WCCN for dimensionality reduction, and Logistic Regression fusion of deep and shallow features, which enables state-of-the-art kinship verification accuracy. The robustness is demonstrated through experiments on three challenging datasets.
