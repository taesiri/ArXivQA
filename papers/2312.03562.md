## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an innovative kinship verification system that fuses deep and shallow facial image features to reliably ascertain biological relationships between individuals. The methodology integrates a Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) preprocessing technique to enhance image quality and contrast. For feature extraction, Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) descriptors capture shallow texture details while the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model extracts profound facial attributes. These complementary features are combined at the score level using Logistic Regression fusion, capitalizing on their synergies. Additional optimizations are made through tensor subspace feature transformations using the robust TXQDA+WCCN algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on three renowned kinship datasets - Cornell Kin Face, UB Kin Face and TS Kin Face - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The proposed system achieves outstanding accuracy rates up to 95.18%, underscoring the viability of fusing deep and shallow visual features with advanced subspace methods for reliable facial image-based kinship verification, even for challenging real world scenarios.
