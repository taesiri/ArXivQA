# [Causal Graph Discovery with Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Causal inference to determine cause-effect relationships between variables is important but challenging. Traditional methods rely on domain knowledge or statistical analysis of observational data, which can be limited by data biases and individual knowledge gaps. Large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities but evaluating their causal reasoning skills is still critical.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel LLM-based method called LLM Assisted Causal Recovery (LACR) that utilizes scientific literature to deduce causal relationships for general causal graph recovery tasks. It leverages retrieval augmented generation capabilities of LLMs to systematically analyze and extract pertinent information from research papers.

Main Steps:
1) Retrieve relevant text chunks from aggregated literature 
2) Task the LLM to identify and label potential associational relationships between factors
3) Aggregate the associational relationships to construct a causal graph with factors as nodes and causal connections as directed edges

Key Contributions:
- Introduces a new LLM-based causal graph recovery framework that leverages literature to reduce bias in traditional methods
- Gives a generic prompt structure to extract associational relations without relying on domain knowledge 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SACHS dataset solely from literature
- Provides comparative analysis with existing methods and offers insights for further enhancing the solution

Overall, the paper makes significant advancements in causal graph recovery by grounding it in scientific evidence while reducing susceptibility to biases. The literature-based LACR framework shows promise as a reliable and robust causal inference tool.
