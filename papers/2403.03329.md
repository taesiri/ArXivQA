# [Guardrail Baselines for Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03329)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Recent work has shown promise for using fine-tuning to "unlearn" concepts from large language models (LLMs). However, fine-tuning can be expensive as it requires generating examples and running iterative training. 

- This paper investigates whether simple "guardrail" methods like prompting and filtering can achieve comparable unlearning performance to fine-tuning on benchmark tasks.

Methods
- The authors evaluate prompting (pre-processing the input) and filtering (post-processing the output) on two unlearning benchmark tasks:
  - "Who's Harry Potter": Unlearning information about the Harry Potter book series
  - TOFU: Unlearning information about fictional authors from a synthetic dataset

- For "Who's Harry Potter", a simple prompt is added instructing the model to unlearn information about Harry Potter. Performance is evaluated on 300 Potter-related questions.

- For TOFU, a filter model (GPT-4 or LLaMA) is applied to the outputs to detect if forgotten author information is present. The output is refused if the filter detects forgotten information.
              
Results
- On "Who's Harry Potter", prompting cuts familiarity scores approximately in half across models. GPT-4 with prompting outperforms all fine-tuned models.

- On TOFU, the filtering approach achieves 95-97% forget accuracy and 99-100% retain accuracy using GPT-4 as the filter. Performance decreases for larger forget sets with LLaMA as the filter.

Conclusions
- Prompting and filtering can be competitive baselines to fine-tuning for unlearning. The simplicity of these methods makes them good initial approaches.

- Metrics are needed that can separate prompting/filtering from fine-tuning. Currently most metrics only examine outputs.

- Prompting could be used to generate examples for fine-tuning and enable "temporary" unlearning until models can be updated. Filtering may better avoid hallucinated outputs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates simple prompting and filtering approaches as baselines for unlearning in large language models, finding that these "guardrail" methods can achieve competitive performance to fine-tuning on benchmark tasks while being more lightweight.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that simple guardrail-based approaches such as prompting and filtering can achieve unlearning results comparable to fine-tuning on certain benchmarks. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that a basic prompt asking models to "unlearn" information about Harry Potter and a simple filter for rejecting answers about certain fictional authors can significantly reduce models' tendency to provide information about those topics. 

The authors argue that these lightweight baselines should be investigated before developing more complex fine-tuning methods for unlearning. They suggest guardrails could complement fine-tuning pipelines by generating data to fine-tune on or temporarily hiding information until models can be updated. The paper also argues current evaluation metrics may not adequately separate the capabilities of guardrails versus fine-tuning.

In summary, the key contribution is highlighting the potential of basic guardrails as competitive baselines or complements to parameter-updating methods for unlearning in large language models. Researchers should consider these simpler approaches in their evaluations.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Unlearning - The main concept explored is unlearning or removing certain concepts from language models. 

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper examines unlearning in the context of large language models like GPT-3 and LLaMA.

- Fine-tuning - Fine-tuning model parameters is one common approach to unlearning that is discussed. 

- Guardrails - The paper proposes using simpler guardrail methods like prompting and filtering as baselines for unlearning.

- Prompting - Prepending a prompt to guide the model's response is one guardrail method evaluated. 

- Filtering - Postprocessing the model's outputs to filter sensitive information is another guardrail approach.

- Threat models - The paper discusses threat models like API-access only that determine when guardrails may be appropriate over fine-tuning.  

- Evaluation metrics - The need for metrics that can separate prompting/filtering and fine-tuning is highlighted.

- Harry Potter benchmark - One case study evaluates unlearning information about the Harry Potter book series.

- TOFU benchmark - Another case study looks at a synthetic dataset of fictional authors (TOFU).

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose using prompting and filtering techniques as computationally lightweight baselines for unlearning. However, prompts can be brittle and require extensive prompt engineering. How can prompts for unlearning be made more robust and generalized?

2. The authors find that a simple prompt is sufficient to cut the Harry Potter familiarity score approximately in half on the LLaMA-7b model. What other prompting techniques could further reduce familiarity while preserving quality on unrelated tasks? 

3. The authors highlight that existing metrics for unlearning evaluate changes to the output distribution rather than model parameters. What novel metrics could better distinguish between prompting/filtering techniques and parameter-level changes from fine-tuning?

4. The authors use GPT-4 as an effective filter for the TOFU dataset since the data was generated by GPT-4. How can effective filters be designed for real-world data not available to foundation models like GPT-4 while preserving privacy?  

5. The authors find that unlearning via fine-tuning seems more prone to hallucination than refusing to answer questions on prohibited topics. What modifications to fine-tuning procedures could mitigate this issue?

6. Prompting was found to degrade performance significantly on the HellaSwag commonsense reasoning benchmark. How can prompting be adapted to minimize impacts on unrelated reasoning abilities?

7. As the number of topics/items to delete increases, guardrails become less efficient. How can the efficiency and scalability of guardrail methods be improved?

8. What adversarial attacks could be used to estimate the brittleness of prompting/filtering techniques for unlearning compared to fine-tuning?

9. Could prompting techniques help automatically generate improved fine-tuning datasets, augmenting existing unlearning pipelines reliant on fine-tuning?

10. The authors use simple evaluation metrics from prior work. What additional metrics should be used to more rigorously evaluate the privacy and security properties of both prompting and fine-tuning techniques?
