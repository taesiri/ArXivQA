# [Strip-MLP: Efficient Token Interaction for Vision MLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11458)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we design an efficient token interaction operation to improve the performance of MLP-based vision models?

Specifically, the authors identify a issue they term "the Token's interaction dilemma" - where the power of token interaction decreases in later layers as the spatial resolution is downsampled. To address this, the paper introduces a new MLP architecture called Strip-MLP with the following key components:

- Strip MLP layer - Allows tokens to interact in a cross-strip manner rather than just within rows/columns. This enriches the token interactions.

- Cascade Group Strip Mixing Module (CGSMM) - Splits features into patches and allows cross-patch token interactions, making it robust to smaller spatial sizes. 

- Local Strip Mixing Module (LSMM) - Captures local interactions more efficiently with a small Strip MLP.

Together, these components aim to improve the token interaction capabilities and power of MLP-based vision models, even as the spatial resolution decreases in deeper layers. The central hypothesis is that this will lead to improved performance on image classification tasks compared to prior MLP architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:

- Proposing a new MLP architecture called Strip-MLP to improve the token interaction power in vision MLP models. The key ideas include:

1) Strip MLP layer - Allows tokens to interact in a cross-strip manner, enabling each row/column to contribute differently to other rows/columns.

2) Cascade Group Strip Mixing Module (CGSMM) - Splits features into patches and allows cross-patch token interactions, making it robust to small spatial sizes. 

3) Local Strip Mixing Module (LSMM) - Captures local interactions more efficiently.

- Showing through experiments that Strip-MLP models achieve much better performance than other MLP models on small datasets like Caltech-101 and CIFAR-100.

- Demonstrating that Strip-MLP can achieve comparable or better accuracy than CNN and Transformer models on ImageNet with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing the Strip-MLP architecture that enriches token interactions in MLPs through strip-wise processing and patching, leading to accuracy gains especially on small datasets. The ablation studies seem to validate the design choices as well.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different architectures and hyperparameter settings for the Strip MLP layer and modules to further optimize performance. The authors mention tuning things like the strip width in the Strip MLP layer and the number of patch splits in the CGSMM module. Additional architectures could also be explored.

- Applying Strip MLP to other computer vision tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc. The authors suggest their method of enriching token interaction power could benefit other vision tasks.

- Exploring the effectiveness of Strip MLP for other modalities like video, point clouds, etc. The paper focuses on images, but the approach may transfer well to other data types.

- Combining Strip MLP with other recent advancements in MLP-based models, such as the dynamic token mixing in DynaMixer or the wave function modeling in Wave-MLP. The authors show integrating Strip MLP into Wave-MLP can boost performance, suggesting further hybridization could help too.

- Developing Strip MLP models with increased capacity and scale for improved performance on large datasets like ImageNet. The paper evaluates smaller models, but larger Strip MLP variants may do better.

- Adapting Strip MLP for low-power efficient hardware, since MLPs have potential for efficient deployment. Optimizing for specific hardware could be valuable.

- Investigating Strip MLP for self-supervised pretraining or representation learning. The authors only explore supervised training, but pretraining could help too.

In general, the core ideas of Strip MLP seem promising for a variety of vision tasks and data types beyond what was explored in the paper. The authors lay out some interesting directions to build on their work in developing more powerful and efficient MLP architectures.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new efficient token interaction MLP model called Strip-MLP for vision tasks. The key idea is to enrich the power of the token interaction layer in three ways. First, it introduces a Strip MLP layer that allows tokens to interact with adjacent tokens in a cross-strip manner, enabling more efficient aggregation between rows and columns. Second, a Cascade Group Strip Mixing Module (CGSMM) is proposed to overcome performance degradation caused by small spatial feature sizes. The module splits features into patches and enables interaction both within and across patches independently of spatial size. Third, a Local Strip Mixing Module (LSMM) with small Strip MLP units is introduced to boost local region token interactions. 

Extensive experiments demonstrate Strip-MLP significantly improves MLP model performance on small datasets, achieving over 2% higher average accuracy on Caltech-101 and CIFAR-100 over existing MLP models. On ImageNet, it achieves comparable or better results than MLP models like MLP-Mixer, gMLP, and ViP. For example, Strip-MLP models attain higher average top-1 accuracy than other MLPs by 2.12% on ImageNet while using fewer parameters and FLOPs. Overall, Strip-MLP enables more efficient token interactions, advancing MLP performance especially on small datasets. The code is available on GitHub.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and contributions of this paper are:

- The paper aims to improve the token interaction operation in MLP-based vision models. The authors point out an issue they term the "token's interaction dilemma" - that the ability of MLP layers to model interactions between spatial tokens is limited by the spatial resolution of the feature maps. As feature maps get downsampled to smaller spatial sizes in deeper layers, the power of token interaction is degraded.

- To address this, the paper proposes a new MLP architecture called Strip-MLP with three main contributions:

1) A Strip MLP layer that allows tokens to interact in a cross-strip manner, enabling better aggregation of information between rows/columns. 

2) A Cascade Group Strip Mixing Module (CGSMM) that splits features into patches and enables token interactions within and across patches, making it robust to small spatial sizes.

3) A Local Strip Mixing Module (LSMM) that enhances local token interactions.

- Together, these components aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of token interactions in MLPs for vision, addressing the limitations of prior MLP models like MLP-Mixer and ViP.

So in summary, the key problem is the declining power of token interactions in deeper layers of MLPs, and the paper introduces architectural innovations to strengthen token interactions across multiple spatial ranges and feature channels. The overall goal is advancing MLP-based vision models.
