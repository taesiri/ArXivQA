# [Cross-Modal Contextualized Diffusion Models for Text-Guided Visual   Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16627)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Prevailing text-guided visual diffusion models primarily focus on incorporating text-visual relationships exclusively into the reverse/sampling process, often disregarding their relevance in the forward/diffusion process. This inconsistency between forward and reverse processes may limit the precise conveyance of textual semantics in visual synthesis results.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel contextualized diffusion model (ContextDiff) by incorporating the cross-modal context, which encompasses the interactions and alignments between text condition and visual sample, into both the forward and reverse processes. Specifically:

1) In the forward process, the cross-modal context extracted by a relational network is propagated to all timesteps to adapt the diffusion trajectories. 

2) In the reverse/sampling process, the cross-modal context is also used to adapt the sampling trajectories to align better with the adapted forward process and facilitate precise expression of textual semantics.

3) The proposed contextualized diffusion is theoretically generalized to both DDPMs and DDIMs with detailed derivations.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a general framework to incorporate cross-modal context into both forward and reverse processes of diffusion models to enhance text-to-visual generation/editing.

2) Achieves new SOTA performance on text-to-image generation and text-to-video editing tasks, demonstrating superior alignment between text and visuals.

3) Generalizable to both DDPMs and DDIMs with theoretical guarantees to benefit both generation and editing scenarios.

4) Qualitative results and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of ContextDiff over strong baselines like Imagen, DALL-E 2, Tune-A-Video, etc. in precisely conveying semantics from text to visuals.

In summary, the paper presents a principled approach to harness cross-modal context in diffusion models to enhance text-guided visual synthesis through well-aligned forward and reverse processes. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed contextualized diffusion.
