# [MDD-Eval: Self-Training on Augmented Data for Multi-Domain Dialogue   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07194)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:

1. How can an automatic dialogue evaluation metric (ADM) learn the skill to accurately discriminate between good and bad dialogue responses? 

2. How can an ADM generalize this evaluation skill across multiple dialogue domains?

The paper proposes a framework called MDD-Eval to tackle these research questions. The key ideas are:

- First train a "teacher" model on human-annotated data from a single domain to acquire a good rating skill for response quality discrimination. 

- Then use this teacher model to label a large amount of augmented multi-domain data. 

- Finally, train a "student" model on this pseudo-labeled multi-domain data to learn to generalize the rating skill across domains.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining learning from human annotations on a small in-domain dataset and pseudo-labeled multi-domain data, an ADM can acquire both an accurate rating skill as well as the ability to generalize this skill across dialogue domains. MDD-Eval is proposed as a framework to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework called MDD-Eval for automatic dialogue evaluation across multiple domains. The key ideas are:

- Train a teacher model on human-annotated data from a single domain to acquire a rating skill to discriminate good and bad dialogue responses. 

- Augment a large multi-domain dialogue dataset using techniques like back-translation, generative models, etc. 

- Train a student model on the augmented dataset using self-training and consistency regularization to generalize the rating skill across domains.

- The student model serves as the basis for a robust automatic dialogue evaluation metric applicable to multiple domains.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a self-training framework called MDD-Eval to learn a generalized dialogue evaluation skill from a teacher model trained on limited annotated data and a large augmented multi-domain dataset. Experiments show MDD-Eval achieves much better correlation with human judgments compared to prior automatic dialogue evaluation metrics on multiple benchmarks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper proposes a new framework called MDD-Eval for multi-domain dialogue evaluation. Most prior work has focused on developing automatic dialogue evaluation metrics for a single domain. MDD-Eval is one of the first to explicitly tackle multi-domain evaluation.

- The key idea in MDD-Eval is to use a self-training approach to learn a robust evaluation model. A teacher model is first trained on human annotations in one domain, then used to generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled multi-domain data. A student model is trained on this augmented dataset to generalize across domains.

- Self-training and consistency regularization techniques used in MDD-Eval have been explored before in other domains like computer vision, but this paper shows their effectiveness for dialogue evaluation. Applying these semi-supervised learning ideas to dialogue is novel.

- Compared to prior work like DEB and USR which rely purely on self-supervised pretraining, MDD-Eval incorporates additional human supervision through the teacher model. This allows it to learn more robustly.

- The paper conducts extensive experiments on multiple dialogue benchmarks. Results show MDD-Eval outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a good margin. This demonstrates its effectiveness for multi-domain evaluation.

- One limitation is MDD-Eval still requires some labeled in-domain data to train the initial teacher model. Fully unsupervised adaptation across unseen domains remains an open challenge.

In summary, this paper makes excellent progress on multi-domain dialogue evaluation by using semi-supervised learning. The self-training framework and consistency regularization in MDD-Eval are novel ideas for this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more advanced data augmentation techniques to generate high-quality multi-domain dialogue data for training the ADMs. The authors suggest exploring conditional text generation models and leveraging external knowledge sources.

- Incorporating more inductive biases into the training objective of the ADMs, such as modeling speaker dependency, utterance dependency, and entity transitions in the dialogues. This could help the ADMs better capture long-range dependencies and perform more context-aware evaluation.

- Exploring different self-training strategies and consistency regularization techniques to further improve the generalization capability of the ADMs across domains.

- Conducting more in-depth error analysis to understand the limitations of current ADMs. For example, analyzing cases where the ADMs fail to recognize key entities or events in the dialogues. 

- Evaluating the ADMs with more dialogue domains and tasks beyond chit-chat and knowledge grounded conversations, such as negotiation, debate, question answering etc.

- Studying the effectiveness of the proposed approach, i.e. learning from human annotations then self-training on augmented data, for learning robust ADMs tailored to other text generation tasks beyond dialogues.

In summary, the main future directions are around developing better data augmentation strategies, incorporating more inductive biases into model training, advancing self-training techniques, conducting detailed error analysis, and evaluating on more diverse dialogue scenarios and text generation tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MDD-Eval, a framework for multi-domain dialogue evaluation. MDD-Eval is trained in a semi-supervised manner under the self-training paradigm. First, a teacher model is pretrained on human-annotated single-domain dialogue data to acquire a rating skill for evaluating dialogue quality. Then, leveraging dialogue data augmentation techniques, a large multi-domain unlabeled dataset is constructed. The teacher model provides pseudo-labels on this dataset. Finally, a student model is trained on the pseudo-labeled data to generalize the rating skill across multiple domains. Experiments on six dialogue benchmarks show that MDD-Eval outperforms state-of-the-art automatic dialogue evaluation metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-domain evaluation. The proposed method only requires a small amount of labeled data and is data-efficient. The released resources including implementation, pretrained models and augmented dataset will facilitate future research on this task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MDD-Eval, a framework for multi-domain dialogue evaluation. The key idea is to train an evaluator using a two-step semi-supervised process. First, a teacher model is trained on human-annotated data from a single domain dialogue corpus to learn to discriminate between good and bad responses. Then, the teacher model is used to annotate a large amount of unlabled multi-domain dialogue data obtained through data augmentation techniques. This results in a multi-domain dataset with machine-annotated labels. Finally, a student model is trained on this dataset using self-training with consistency regularization and domain adaptation techniques. This allows the student model to generalize the rating skill learned by the teacher model to new domains.

MDD-Eval is evaluated on six dialogue evaluation benchmarks covering different domains. It significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art automatic dialogue evaluation metrics, with an absolute improvement of 7% in terms of average Spearman correlation. This demonstrates that the proposed self-training framework allows effective transfer of the rating skill to new domains. The released multi-domain dataset, model implementation, and checkpoints will facilitate further research and application of robust automatic evaluation for dialogue systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents MDD-Eval, a framework for multi-domain dialogue evaluation. The key method is a self-training approach on augmented data. The steps are:

1) Train a teacher model on human-annotated data from a single domain to acquire a rating skill to discriminate good and bad dialogue responses. 

2) Use data augmentation techniques like back-translation, generative models, and syntactic perturbations to construct a large multi-domain dataset. Apply the teacher model to annotate this dataset with soft pseudo-labels.

3) Train a student model on the pseudo-labeled multi-domain data. The student model optimizes a joint objective of cross-entropy loss on pseudo-labels, masked language modeling loss for domain adaptation, and KL divergence loss for consistency regularization.

4) The student model generalizes the rating skill of the teacher model to multiple domains. It serves as the backbone of the MDD-Eval metric that can effectively evaluate dialogue systems across domains.

In summary, MDD-Eval utilizes self-training on augmented data to learn a robust dialogue evaluation model - acquiring the rating skill from human-annotated data and general knowledge across domains from machine-annotated data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of developing an automatic dialogue evaluation metric that can effectively assess dialogue systems across multiple domains. 

The key questions the paper seeks to address are:

1) How can an automatic dialogue evaluation metric (ADM) learn the skill of discriminating between good and bad dialogue responses?

2) How can the ADM acquire general knowledge across different dialogue domains so it can generalize its evaluation skill?

The paper proposes a new framework called MDD-Eval to tackle these questions. The main ideas are:

- Train a "teacher" model on human-annotated data to acquire a rating skill for a particular domain.

- Transfer the skill from the teacher to a "student" model via self-training on the augmented dataset, helping it generalize across domains.

So in summary, the paper aims to develop a robust ADM that can effectively evaluate dialogue systems in multiple domains, which has been a challenging task. The key contribution is a self-training framework to equip the model with both a rating skill from human data and generalizable knowledge from augmented multi-domain data.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes MDD-Eval, a framework for automatic dialogue evaluation across multiple domains. The key innovation is using a self-training approach to learn a generalized evaluation skill from both human-annotated and machine-annotated dialogue data. 

First, a teacher model is pretrained on DailyDialog++, a human-annotated single-domain dataset, to acquire a rating skill for distinguishing good and bad responses. Then, the teacher model provides pseudo-labels on a large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset called MDD-Data. The MDD-Data is constructed by augmenting dialogues from DailyDialog, ConvAI2, EmpatheticDialogues, and TopicalChat using techniques like back-translation, generative models, and linguistic perturbations. 

Next, a student model is trained on the machine-annotated MDD-Data via self-training. The student model optimization incorporates cross-entropy loss for pseudo-label prediction, masked language modeling loss for domain adaptation, and KL divergence loss for consistency regularization. After training, the student model becomes the metric backbone for multi-domain evaluation.

Experiments over six dialogue benchmarks across different domains demonstrate MDD-Eval's effectiveness. It outperforms state-of-the-art automatic metrics like DEB, achieving 7% higher average Spearman correlation. Ablations confirm that each component of MDD-Eval like teacher bootstrapping, data augmentation, and consistency regularization contribute to the strong performance.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in proposing a generalized automatic evaluation approach spanning diverse dialogue domains. The released MDD-Data and MDD-Eval code/models enable future research on this important dialogue evaluation problem.
