# [AutoDev: Automated AI-Driven Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot have limited capabilities as they cannot fully leverage IDE functions such as building, testing, executing code, git operations, etc. They focus mainly on suggesting code snippets within a chat interface. This constrains their capabilities and requires developers to still manually validate and test AI-generated code.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes AutoDev, a framework for fully automated AI-driven software development. AutoDev allows users to define complex software engineering tasks which are assigned to autonomous AI Agents. These agents can edit files, retrieve information, execute builds and tests, perform git operations - executing tasks automatically with comprehensive context. AutoDev establishes a secure Docker-based environment for development. It incorporates guardrails for user privacy and security by allowing configuration of permitted/restricted agent actions.

Key Contributions:
- AutoDev architecture comprising Conversation Manager, Tools Library, Agent Scheduler and Evaluation Environment to enable autonomous AI-driven development
- Empirical evaluation on HumanEval dataset for code and test generation tasks, achieving 91.5% and 87.8% Pass@1 respectively without extra training data
- Ability for multi-agent collaboration on tasks, with specialized agents having distinct capabilities and responsibilities
- Secure agent-repository interaction achieved via Docker execution environment  

In summary, AutoDev advances the state-of-art by empowering AI agents to autonomously execute intricate development tasks with contextual understanding and within a controlled environment. The promising evaluation results validate AutoDev's effectiveness in automating key SE objectives while prioritizing user security.
