# [Multiplying Matrices Without Multiplying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10860)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently approximate matrix multiplication. Specifically, the authors propose a new approximate matrix multiplication algorithm called MADDNESS that aims to greatly outperform existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy tradeoffs.

The key ideas behind MADDNESS are:

- Using a learned hash function instead of expensive distance computations to assign vectors to prototypes/buckets. This encoding step is orders of magnitude faster than in prior methods.

- Optimizing the prototypes to minimize reconstruction error, allowing better utilization of the encoding's capacity. 

- Using averaging operations instead of additions to aggregate bucket lookup results. This allows keeping sums in low-bitwidth integers for longer to exploit SIMD instructions.

- Providing theoretical guarantees on the overall approximation error based on quantization error bounds and generalization theory.

The overall goal is to get significant speedups over exact matrix multiplication and other approximate methods on real-world matrices, especially when one matrix is much larger than the other. The hypothesis is that a mixture of hashing, averaging, and byte shuffling can outperform the sparsified/factorized/quantized matrix products commonly proposed in prior work.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the algorithmic innovations in MADDNESS will enable superior speed-quality tradeoffs compared to prior approximate matrix multiplication techniques. The paper evaluates this hypothesis through extensive experiments on real-world matrix multiplication tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is an approximate matrix multiplication algorithm called MADDNESS that outperforms existing methods. The key ideas behind MADDNESS are:

- Using a learned hash function based on balanced binary regression trees to quickly encode the rows of the input matrix A. This encoding is orders of magnitude faster than vector quantization methods like product quantization.

- Optimizing the vector quantization prototypes by reconstructing the training matrix from them using ridge regression. This allows the prototypes to capture mutual information between different subspaces. 

- Using averaging operations instead of addition to aggregate results when doing table lookups. This allows faster computation with 8-bit integers while introducing only a small, bounded amount of bias.

The authors evaluate MADDNESS extensively on hundreds of real-world matrices from domains like image classification, time series classification, and image filtering. The results show it achieves up to 100x speedups over exact matrix multiplication and 10x speedups over prior approximate methods.

The paper also provides theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including generalization error bounds and closed-form expressions for the bias introduced by the approximate integer summation.

In summary, the main contribution is a new approximate matrix multiplication method with strong empirical performance and theoretical grounding, enabled by novel techniques for fast encoding, prototype optimization, and low-bitwidth aggregation. The results suggest this approach could be promising for accelerating machine learning workloads.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a method for quantizing lookup tables for approximate matrix multiplication that computes table-specific offset and scale factors to linearly map the largest and smallest table entries to 255 and 0, enabling the use of 8-bit integers and SIMD vector operations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I see it comparing to other related research:

- The paper focuses on approximate matrix multiplication (AMM), which is a well-studied problem in machine learning and scientific computing. The key difference from most prior AMM work is the use of a nonlinear preprocessing function and reduction to table lookups, rather than linear projections and dense matrix multiplies.

- The most similar prior methods are vector quantization approaches like Product Quantization (PQ) and Optimized PQ (OPQ) used for similarity search and nearest neighbor problems. However, the paper introduces a new family of fast, trainable hash functions to avoid the expensive distance computations in traditional VQ methods. It also optimizes prototypes differently and uses averaging for aggregation.

- Compared to general dimensionality reduction methods like random projections (JL transforms) or matrix sketching (Frequent Directions), the paper's approach is more tailored to the matrix multiplication problem, exploits a training set, and achieves much larger speedups by avoiding most multiplications.

- The idea of using hashing or binary representations to avoid dense linear transforms has appeared in some neural network acceleration papers. However, those methods differ in their specific hash functions, problem formulation, and goals. They focus only on sampling or approximating extreme outputs rather than the full matrix product.

- Overall, the proposed method seems substantially different from prior art in its combination of trainable locality-sensitive hashing, prototype optimization, and approximate summation. The most unique aspects are the specific hash function design and the replacement of linear transforms with direct nonlinear encoding. Experiments demonstrate large improvements in speed and accuracy over existing AMM techniques.

In summary, the paper pushes AMM research in a new direction and demonstrates strong empirical results, though extensions may be needed to achieve similar speedups on specialized hardware accelerators. The proposed hash function and overall approach seem novel compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Implementing and evaluating their method on GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The paper focuses on CPU performance but the authors mention adapting the method to GPUs/FPGAs as an area for future work. This would likely require algorithmic modifications and substantial engineering work.

- Extending their method to convolutional neural networks. The authors mention that specializing their approach for large convolutions and integrating it into neural network frameworks is an important area for future work. This would require adapting the method to exploit the structure and weight sharing in convolutional layers.

- Accelerating full neural networks with ideas similar to their method. The authors suggest their approach could potentially be useful for accelerating networks, particularly for inference. However, this would require significant research to determine how best to incorporate the non-differentiable hash function and deal with changing activation distributions during training.

- Evaluating the hash function and integer summation methods as standalone components. The authors designed these algorithmic pieces to enable their overall method, but suggest evaluating them independently could be interesting future work.

- Implementing their approach on multi-threaded CPUs and assessing potential for memory bandwidth reductions. The current work focuses on single-threaded performance but extending to multi-threaded and analyzing memory bandwidth could be impactful.

- Developing specialized hardware that could efficiently execute the core operations like hashing, byte shuffling, and table lookup. The paper suggests this could potentially be more efficient than current matrix multiplication hardware.

So in summary, the main directions are: specialized hardware implementations, extending to convolutional nets and full networks, multi-threaded/memory optimizations, and evaluating modular algorithmic components independently.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on hundreds of diverse real-world matrices.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new approximate matrix multiplication algorithm called Maddness (Multiply-ADDition-less). The main idea is to learn vector quantization functions that encode the input matrices into compact binary codes. These codes allow the matrix product to be estimated using only table lookups and integer averaging operations, avoiding costly multiply-adds. 

Specifically, the encoding functions are learned regression trees that binarize input vectors. The prototypes associated with each leaf are then optimized to reconstruct the training data. At test time, rows of the input matrix A are encoded with the learned trees. A lookup table is constructed for each column of matrix B by precomputing dot products between the prototypes and that column. The approximate product C is computed by using the binary codes from A to index into the tables for each column of B and accumulating the retrieved values. An approximate integer averaging scheme avoids overflow and allows fast in-register accumulation.

Compared to prior methods like product quantization, Maddness learns a space-efficient encoding without needing expensive distance computations like kmeans. The use of averaging for aggregation and optimizing prototypes based on the codes are also new. Experiments show Maddness achieves much higher throughput and approximation quality compared to previous approaches. The method is particularly effective when one matrix is known in advance, allowing encode-free inference.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is presenting a new approximate matrix multiplication algorithm called MADDNESS. The key ideas and contributions are:

- It introduces a new family of fast, learned hash functions that can encode vectors very efficiently. This encoding is the core of the approximation algorithm.

- It presents a method for quickly aggregating low-bitwidth sums without overflow, by using averaging operations instead of saturating addition.

- It combines these components into an overall approximate matrix multiplication algorithm. This algorithm is shown empirically to be much faster than prior methods for a given level of approximation error.

- There are theoretical results bounding the error of the overall algorithm, based on errors from the encoding function and summation. 

So in summary, the paper is addressing the problem of how to efficiently approximate matrix multiplication, especially for cases where one matrix is much larger than the other. It proposes a new method based on learned hashing and integer averaging that is both faster and has theoretical guarantees. The importance is that matrix multiplication is a fundamental bottleneck operation used throughout machine learning and scientific computing.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces \ours (Multiply-ADDitioN-lESS), a new learning-based algorithm for approximate matrix multiplication that greatly outperforms existing methods. The key idea is to use a fast hash-based encoding function to map the rows of the matrix A to prototype vectors. These prototypes are optimized using ridge regression to reconstruct A from the encodings. To multiply the encoded A with a matrix B, precomputed lookup tables containing inner products between B and the prototypes are aggregated based on the encoding indices.

This paper introduces Maddness, a new approximate matrix multiplication algorithm that can achieve significant speedups over exact matrix multiplication and existing approximate algorithms. The key idea is to use locality-sensitive hashing to encode the rows of the input matrix A into short binary codes. This allows dot products between rows of A and columns of B to be estimated by looking up precomputed inner products between the columns of B and learned hash bucket prototypes, avoiding expensive multiply-add operations.
