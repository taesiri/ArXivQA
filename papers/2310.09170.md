# [mnmDTW: An extension to Dynamic Time Warping for Camera-based Movement   Error Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09170)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we extend Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to better localize errors in camera-based movement analysis? 

Specifically, the authors propose a new "multi-layer normalized multi-dimensional DTW" (mnmDTW) approach to assess individual body parts when evaluating exercises from video. Their goal is to not just classify overall movement correctness, but to provide more granular feedback on which body part is responsible for an error and what the error is qualitatively.

The key hypothesis appears to be that by calculating DTW distances for individual limbs after synchronizing to a gold standard movement, they can accurately identify and describe movement errors beyond simple binary classification.

In summary, the central research question is how to improve camera-based automated exercise evaluation by modifying DTW to better localize errors to specific body parts. The hypothesis is that their proposed mnmDTW method can achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new approach called "multi-layer normalized multi-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (mnmDTW)" for camera-based movement error localization. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- They use computer vision methods to extract pose information from exercise videos. 

- They apply Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to calculate the deviation of the exercise execution from a predefined gold standard execution. 

- They calculate the DTW distance for each body part/limb group separately, in order to identify which specific part is responsible for an error.

- They normalize the DTW distances using baseline values from correct exercises. This makes the values more intuitive for interpreting.

- They demonstrate the approach on squat exercises, showing it can accurately classify predefined mistakes and also provide qualitative information about the type and localization of errors.

In summary, the main novelty is the multi-layer normalized extension of multi-dimensional DTW to enable precise and explainable localization of movement errors from video, even for unknown mistakes. This could be useful for automated assessment and feedback in applications like physical therapy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new multi-layer normalized multi-dimensional dynamic time warping (mnmDTW) approach to evaluate individual body parts during exercises captured on video, showing it can accurately classify and qualitatively describe predefined movement execution errors.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in camera-based movement analysis and error localization:

- The use of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for movement evaluation is not new, as the authors acknowledge by citing previous works like Sempena et al. and Adistambha et al. However, those works only look at the overall DTW distance for the full body movement.

- The key novel contribution here is the multi-layer normalized multi-dimensional DTW (mnmDTW) approach that calculates separate DTW distances for different body parts (limbs) to localize errors. This builds on multi-dimensional DTW but adds the normalization and body part separation.

- Other papers like Liu & Chu also aim to identify which body parts cause errors, but using machine learning methods rather than DTW. The mnmDTW approach has the benefits of simplicity and interpretability compared to ML. 

- The experiment is small scale (only 18 samples) but demonstrates the potential of this approach. More thorough validation on larger/diverse datasets would be needed to compare robustness to other methods.

- The lack of ground truth 3D pose data or motion capture is a limitation compared to some other works. The reliance on 2D camera coordinates may limit accuracy and robustness. 

- Overall, this paper presents a novel extension to DTW that enables more localized movement analysis. It demonstrates promising capabilities on a simple example. More work would be needed to extensively validate against other camera-based movement analysis techniques. But the interpretability of mnmDTW is a differentiator from many ML approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Conducting a larger experiment with more recordings, participants, camera angles, exercises, etc. to further validate the approach and investigate factors like individual differences.

- Extending the mnmDTW metric to 3D coordinates instead of just 2D image coordinates. This could reduce dependencies on camera properties. 

- Exploring different groupings of the joint coordinates into limbs when calculating the second mDTW layer. Using smaller groups could enable even more precise localization of errors.

- Applying the approach to a variety of exercises beyond just squats to see how well it generalizes.

- Comparing the mnmDTW approach to other methods like machine learning for exercise evaluation.

- Integrating the approach into a full system that can provide users with real-time feedback and automatically detect mistakes during home exercises. 

- Enhancing the qualitative analysis to automatically generate natural language descriptions of detected errors.

- Testing the utility of the approach in areas like physical therapy, sports training, etc. to determine real-world applicability.

In summary, the main suggestions are to conduct more extensive validation, explore variations of the technique, integrate it into downstream applications, and evaluate real-world usefulness. The authors seem to view mnmDTW as a promising direction for detailed automated exercise assessment.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents an approach for camera-based movement error localization using pose estimation and an extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) called multi-layer normalized multi-dimensional DTW (mnmDTW). The authors extract pose information from exercise videos using MediaPipe Pose. They use DTW to align and synchronize the test videos to a predefined gold standard execution of the exercise. They then group the synchronized pose coordinates into limb segments and perform a second DTW calculation per limb segment to get limb-specific distance metrics. Experiments on squat videos show the mnmDTW approach can not only classify overall movement mistakes but also localize the limbs responsible for the errors and provide information on the type of mistake qualitatively. The method shows promise for identifying and providing feedback on exercise mistakes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents an approach for camera-based movement error localization using an extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) called multi-layer normalized multi-dimensional DTW (mnmDTW). The authors extract pose information from exercise videos using MediaPipe Pose. They use DTW to align and synchronize the joint coordinates from test videos to a predefined gold standard video. The synchronized joint coordinates are then grouped into limbs and a second DTW is performed for each limb group to calculate limb-specific distance metrics. 

The authors test their approach on squat exercise videos containing intentional mistakes. The results demonstrate that mnmDTW can accurately classify predefined mistakes and also provide qualitative descriptions of the errors in terms of which limbs are responsible and the type of deviation. The metrics clearly indicate when mistakes occur and enable localization of where the error originates. The authors conclude that mnmDTW shows promise for detailed automated assessment of exercise quality from video for applications such as remote physical therapy monitoring. They suggest future work to evaluate the approach on a larger scale with more variety in exercises, participants and camera angles.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a multi-layer normalized multi-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (mnmDTW) approach to evaluate and localize errors in human movements captured on video. The method first extracts pose information from videos using MediaPipe Pose. It then aligns the test video to a predefined gold standard video using multi-dimensional DTW. The synchronized pose data is split into limb groups and a second DTW is calculated for each limb group separately, as well as for x- and y-coordinates independently. This results in limb-specific distance metrics that indicate how much each body part deviates from the gold standard, enabling localization and characterization of movement errors. The metrics are also normalized using baseline values from correct videos to improve interpretability. The method is demonstrated on squat exercise videos, where it successfully identifies and describes intentional mistakes.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of evaluating and giving feedback on the quality of exercise executions, specifically for physical therapy/rehabilitation purposes, using computer vision and pose estimation methods. 

The key questions it seems to be tackling are:

- How can we extract pose/motion information from exercise videos in an automated way? They use MediaPipe Pose for this.

- How can we compare the extracted pose information to a "gold standard" execution to quantify errors and deviations? They propose a multi-layer normalized multi-dimensional DTW (mnmDTW) approach for this comparison. 

- How can we use this comparison to not just classify the overall quality, but also localize which body parts are responsible for the errors? The mnmDTW approach calculates distances for each limb group separately to enable localization.

- Can this system accurately detect and describe common mistakes in exercises, even without being explicitly trained on them? Their small experiment shows promising results in identifying and characterizing predefined mistakes.

So in summary, it's developing a CV and time series analysis pipeline to automatically evaluate exercise quality and provide feedback on the specific limbs contributing to errors, with applications for unsupervised physical therapy.
