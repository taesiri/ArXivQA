# [AdVerb: Visually Guided Audio Dereverberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12370)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can visual information about a room's geometry and acoustics be used to dereverberate reverberant audio signals?Specifically, the authors propose a novel audio-visual dereverberation framework called AdVerb that incorporates visual cues from panoramic images of the environment to estimate clean speech from reverberant speech signals. The key hypothesis is that by modeling the room's 3D spatial geometry and material properties from visual inputs, the model can better estimate the reverberation effects and remove them to reconstruct the anechoic audio signal.The paper presents AdVerb's cross-modal architecture, which uses a geometry-aware transformer network to combine local and global visual features. It predicts a complex ideal ratio mask that suppresses reverberation when applied to the input spectrogram. The central research questions are:- Can visual cues about room geometry and materials provide complementary information to guide the dereverberation process?- Can cross-modal modeling of audio and visual streams lead to better dereverberation compared to audio-only methods?- Can explicitly encoding 3D spatial relationships in the visual stream improve modeling of reverberation effects?The results and evaluations aim to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed audio-visual approach over audio-only baselines, validating the core hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The authors propose AdVerb, a novel cross-modal framework for audio dereverberation that leverages visual cues from panoramic images of the environment. 2. A key component of AdVerb is a geometry-aware conformer network that captures 3D spatial semantics to incorporate salient visual information. This includes novel components like (shifted) window blocks, panoptic blocks, and a relative position embedding scheme.3. Instead of directly estimating the clean audio, AdVerb predicts a complex ideal ratio mask which is applied to the input reverberant spectrogram. The model is trained with two novel losses - spectrogram prediction and acoustic token matching loss.4. Extensive experiments show AdVerb significantly outperforms prior audio-only and audio-visual baselines on speech enhancement, recognition, and speaker verification tasks. For example, it achieves 18-82% relative improvement over the best audio baseline on LibriSpeech. The effectiveness is also validated through user studies.5. The authors demonstrate the applicability of the method to real-world video data from the AVSpeech dataset, where AdVerb achieves the lowest reverberation time estimation error compared to other methods.In summary, the key novelty seems to be in developing a specialized cross-modal architecture that can effectively exploit visual cues for the challenging task of audio dereverberation, and showing its effectiveness on both synthetic and real datasets. The geometry-aware modeling and dual loss approach appear to be important contributions.
