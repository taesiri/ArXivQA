# [We Need to Talk About Classification Evaluation Metrics in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03831)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classification tasks in NLP commonly use metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance. However, these metrics have limitations:
   - Accuracy can be high just by guessing the most common class, not necessarily reflecting true model capability (the "accuracy paradox").  
   - F1-score depends on weighting of precision and recall which varies across models. Macro-averaging F1 weights all classes equally, ignoring class prevalence.
   - AUC-ROC applies a cost function dependent on the false positive rate, preventing comparison of models with different false positive rates.
- The diversity and arbitrariness in choice of metrics suggests no consensus on the best evaluation approach in NLP. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper advocates using Informedness, an unbiased multi-class metric that avoids crediting models for just guessing or exploiting bias. 
- Informedness measures the proportion of times the model makes an informed decision, i.e. better than bias exploitation strategies. This allows comparing models across tasks of differing bias or complexity.

Key Contributions:
- Compares Informedness against many standard classification metrics on synthetic and real NLP tasks.
- Shows that Informedness best captures model generalization capability compared to metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
- Finds that choice of evaluation metric significantly impacts model ranking. 
- Provides implementation of Informedness and Normalized Information Transfer.
- Encourages NLP community to consider reporting Informedness to better evaluate classification performance.

In summary, the paper demonstrates limitations of existing classification metrics through extensive experiments, and shows Informedness to be an unbiased metric that avoids crediting models for just guessing. It encourages adopting Informedness alongside Accuracy and F1-score to better evaluate NLP classification tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper empirically compares classification evaluation metrics on a range of NLP tasks and advocates using the Informedness metric instead of common metrics like Accuracy and F1, as it better captures model generalization capacity by avoiding biases that suggest higher performance than justified.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper defines and advocates for using the Informedness metric for evaluating classification tasks in NLP instead of common metrics like Accuracy and F1. Informedness measures the proportion of the time a classifier makes an informed (better than random guessing) decision.

2) Through extensive experiments on a variety of NLP tasks, the paper shows that Informedness provides a fairer assessment of model generalization capability compared to other metrics. It avoids crediting models for just exploiting biases or guessing prevalent classes.

3) The paper releases an implementation of Informedness following the sklearn classifier format to encourage further research and adoption in the community. 

In summary, the key contribution is promoting Informedness as an improved, bias-resistant evaluation metric for classification in NLP, supported by empirical evidence from experiments across different tasks. The release of an Informedness implementation also aims to drive further research and usage.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Classification metrics - The paper analyzes and compares various metrics used for evaluating classification models, including Accuracy, F1 Score, Informedness, AUC-ROC, etc.

- Bias in metrics - The authors discuss issues with common metrics like Accuracy and F1 Score in terms of bias towards more prevalent classes.

- Informedness metric - The paper advocates using the Informedness metric which avoids rewarding guessing or bias and allows comparison across tasks.

- Experiments across NLP tasks - Experiments are conducted evaluating metrics on tasks like natural language understanding, visual question answering, machine translation.

- Model ranking - The choice of evaluation metric is shown to affect model ranking and comparisons across sub-tasks. 

- Interpretability - Informedness is argued to provide a more interpretable measure of model capability compared to metrics like Accuracy.

- Information theory - Concepts from information theory like entropy and mutual information are relevant to metrics like Normalized Information Transfer.

In summary, the key ideas have to do with analyzing bias in common classification metrics and proposing the use of the Informedness metric for improved evaluation and model comparison in NLP tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that common evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1, and AUC-ROC encode problematic heuristics and biases. Can you elaborate on some of the specific issues with these metrics? How do they fail to adequately measure model performance?

2. The paper proposes using Informedness as an improved evaluation metric. Walk through the mathematical definition and formulation of Informedness. What specifically does it measure and why is this useful? 

3. In the synthetic experiments, what key differences emerge between Informedness and other metrics as factors like class distribution and model predictive power are varied? How does Informedness avoid issues like label bias and baseline credit?

4. In the GLUE experiments, what causes the substantial gap between Accuracy and Informedness on certain tasks? How does Informedness expose issues with the adversarial WNLI dataset that Accuracy obscures? 

5. For the GQA experiments, compare and contrast how the different metrics perform on question types with vastly different numbers of samples. Why is Informedness better suited for intra-dataset comparisons?

6. On the KVQA dataset, Accuracy and Informedness provide divergent assessments of the model's capability on certain question types. Analyze some examples of this discrepancy. What strengths and weaknesses of the model does Informedness reveal that other metrics do not?

7. The authors state "we propose that Informedness is a more intuitive measure for NLP" compared to metrics like Normalized Information Transfer. Elaborate on the arguments they provide to support this claim. What are the criteria Informedness optimizes for?

8. For the formality translation task, discuss why a baseline model can achieve ~50% for Accuracy and F1 but 0 for Informedness. What implications does this have for using Informedness to compare MT systems?

9. What limitations or potential drawbacks does Informedness have as an evaluation metric? In what scenarios might it break down or fail to provide an accurate assessment?

10. The authors advocate adopting Informedness more widely in NLP research. Discuss practical implementation considerations and challenges that may hinder more widespread adoption. How can the reference implementation provided help address these?
