# [FAX: Scalable and Differentiable Federated Primitives in JAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) involves training machine learning models over decentralized data located on multiple clients. Performing FL computations introduces challenges around scalability, efficiency, and ease of algorithm expression compared to traditional centralized training.
- Existing FL frameworks have limitations in simultaneously providing performant data center execution, easy algorithm expression via automated differentiation, and integration with production cross-device FL systems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents FAX, a library for defining federated computations based on JAX primitives. 
- FAX represents federated values as arrays with an extra dimension indicating their placement at the server or clients. Federated computations like broadcast, map, and sum are implemented as JAX primitives operating on these placed arrays.
- Embedding federated building blocks as JAX primitives allows FAX to:
  - Compile federated computations into efficient XLA code
  - Leverage JAX's sharding to scale across devices
  - Implement federated automatic differentiation (FAD) by defining Jacobian-vector products for the primitives
  - Generate program representations preserving placement for translation to production systems

Main Contributions:
- FAX provides a framework for scalable and efficient federated computations in the data center, demonstrating near constant runtime for federated training of large language models with up to 8 billion parameters and 512 clients.
- FAX implements FAD, greatly simplifying the expression of federated algorithms like FedSGD via automatic differentiation.
- FAX generates interpretable program representations that can be translated to production cross-device FL systems while preserving information about data placement and communication.

In summary, FAX enables easy authoring, scalable execution and differentiation of federated programs while keeping open the possibility of translation to real-world cross-device FL systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

FAX is a JAX-based library for scalable federated learning that enables efficient data center training, easy algorithm expression via federated automatic differentiation, and translation to production cross-device systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting FAX, a JAX-based library for defining scalable distributed and federated computations. Specifically:

- FAX embeds a federated programming model into JAX via JAX's primitive (`prim`) mechanism. This allows FAX to leverage JAX features like sharding, just-in-time (JIT) compilation to XLA, and automatic differentiation.

- FAX provides efficient and scalable implementations of core federated building blocks like federated broadcast, federated map, and federated sum/mean. This enables large-scale federated computations in the data center.

- FAX implements Federated Automatic Differentiation (FAD), greatly simplifying the expression of federated computations that require differentiation. 

- FAX preserves data location information in its intermediate representations. This allows translation of FAX computations to production federated learning systems.

In summary, the main contribution is the design and implementation of the FAX library to support scalable, differentiable federated computations that can be translated to production systems. The goal is to accelerate research and development of federated learning algorithms.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Federated learning (FL) - A distributed machine learning approach that enables training models over decentralized data located on devices like phones or hospitals without requiring direct data sharing.

- Federated Automatic Differentiation (FAD) - An extension of automatic differentiation techniques like backpropagation to federated learning algorithms, enabling easier algorithm development.

- JAX - A Python framework for neural network development that provides tools like automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation. 

- Primitives - Basic building blocks that enable complex computations. FAX implements federated learning primitives like federated broadcast and federated mean in JAX.

- Sharding - Splitting a computation over distributed devices like multiple TPU chips. FAX uses sharding annotations to ensure scalability. 

- Weak scaling - Evaluating how computation time changes as workload and compute resources increase proportionally. FAX demonstrates good weak scaling.

- jaxpr - JAX's intermediate representation that preserves structure information like communication patterns that can be interpreted by federated systems.

So in summary, key terms cover concepts like federated learning, differentiation, parallelization, JAX integration, and computation graphs that can connect to production systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. How does FAX represent federated values like federated arrays and federated structures? Explain the key differences from typical JAX array representations.

2. Explain how FAX implements the core federated building blocks (federated broadcast, federated map, federated sum) using JAX primitives. Why is the JAX primitive mechanism crucial for enabling key FAX capabilities?  

3. The paper argues that "JIT compilation alone is not enough" to parallelize federated computations efficiently. Explain why, even with advanced compilers, directly JIT compiling a naive federated computation may not result in good scaling performance.  

4. Explain FAX's use of static and dynamic sharding constraints and why they are crucial for performance, especially as the number of clients grows large. Provide concrete examples if possible.

5. Walk through how FAX implements federated automatic differentiation (FAD) by building on JAX's AD capabilities. Why can standard AD techniques be combined with placement manipulations to implement FAD?

6. Explain how FAX generates JAXPRs that preserve information about data placements and communication patterns. How can this enable translation of FAX programs to production federated learning systems?

7. Analyze the sample JAXPRs provided for the federated loss computation and its gradient. What key information is preserved compared to a standard JAX AD computation?

8. How exactly does FAD simplify the expression and implementation efficiency of federated learning algorithms? Provide 1-2 concrete examples from the paper.  

9. What are some ways FAX could be extended, for example to more general data placements? Can you propose other useful extensions or areas of future work?

10. How does FAX aim to accelerate research on distributed and parallel machine learning, beyond just federated learning? Provide examples of other types of algorithms it could aid with.
