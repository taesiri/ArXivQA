# [ViewFusion: Towards Multi-View Consistency via Interpolated Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18842)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ViewFusion: Towards Multi-View Consistency via Interpolated Denoising":

Problem:
- Novel view synthesis through diffusion models has shown great potential for generating diverse and high-quality images. However, the independent image generation process leads to a lack of multi-view consistency across synthesized views.

Solution:
- The paper proposes ViewFusion, a training-free algorithm that can be integrated into existing pre-trained diffusion models to improve multi-view consistency. 

- Key ideas:
  - Adopts an auto-regressive approach where previously generated views provide context to guide the generation of the next view. This models the joint distribution of views.
  - Proposes a novel "interpolated denoising" process that fuses information from known views via weighted interpolation at each denoising step.
  - Allows pre-trained single-view diffusion models to work in multi-view conditional settings without additional fine-tuning.

Contributions:
- Training-free algorithm that improves multi-view consistency of diffusion-based novel view synthesis.
- Auto-regressive approach with interpolated denoising that extends single-view conditioning to multi-view.
- Performance improvements demonstrated on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction tasks using ABO and GSO datasets.
- Qualitative results on real images also showcase improved consistency.
- Overall, the method addresses a key limitation of diffusion models in maintaining multi-view consistency across independently generated views.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards achieving consistent novel view synthesis from diffusion models via a training-free technique. The interpolated denoising elegantly allows incorporation of context from previous views.
