# [Looking at CTR Prediction Again: Is Attention All You Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05563)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Whether attention mechanism alone is sufficient for effective feature processing in CTR prediction models. The authors propose a general neural network framework for CTR prediction built on self-attention mechanism. They aim to show that most existing CTR prediction models can be unified under this framework, suggesting that attention is the key mechanism for feature interaction in these models.Specifically, the paper:- Uses a discrete choice model to redefine CTR prediction and propose a general framework with embedding, feature interaction, aggregation and transformation layers.- Defines a general form of feature interaction based on self-attention and shows how existing models like FM, FFM, DeepFM etc. fit into this form.- Proposes extended models called SAMs based on self-attention feature interaction.- Examines the expressive power and complexity of the proposed models.- Validates the framework on real-world datasets and shows the proposed SAM models achieve competitive performance.In summary, the central hypothesis is that attention mechanism alone is sufficient for modeling feature interactions in CTR prediction. The paper aims to support this claim through the proposed unified framework and analysis.
