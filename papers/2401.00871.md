# [PlanarNeRF: Online Learning of Planar Primitives with Neural Radiance   Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00871)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying complete 3D planar primitives (planes) from visual data is important for 3D reconstruction, but existing methods have limitations:
    - Many only detect 2D plane segments per image view, lacking cross-view consistency
    - Some establish sparse correspondence across views, still lacking complete scene representations
    - Recent end-to-end deep learning method oversimplifies scene structures
    - Most rely heavily on extensive manual annotations like 2D/3D plane labels, limiting generalization

Proposed Solution:
- Propose PlanarNeRF, a novel framework for detecting dense 3D planes through online learning
    - Enhances plane detection using both scene appearance and geometry
    - Has two modes:
        1. PlanarNeRF-S: Supervised, uses sparse 2D plane annotations 
        2. PlanarNeRF-SS: Self-supervised, no annotations
    - For self-supervised:
        - Lightweight plane fitting module estimates planes from sparse sampled points
        - Global memory bank tracks plane instances across views for label generation

Main Contributions:
- Extends neural radiance fields to regress plane primitives using both appearance and geometry
- Lightweight plane fitting module for estimating plane parameters
- Global memory bank with update mechanism for consistent plane instance tracking and label generation
- Flexible architecture allows both 2D-supervised and self-supervised solutions
- Significantly outperforms existing methods in detecting complete and accurate 3D planar primitives

In summary, PlanarNeRF introduces an innovative online learning framework to detect 3D planar primitives from RGB-D videos. It overcomes limitations of prior arts by integrating both appearance and geometry cues, as well as through the design of a lightweight plane fitting module and a global memory bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanarNeRF in reconstructing complete and accurate plane instances.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces PlanarNeRF, a novel framework that leverages neural radiance fields to detect complete 3D planar primitives from monocular RGB and depth sequences in an online fashion, combining both scene appearance and geometry insights while requiring only sparse supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of PlanarNeRF are:

1. Introduction of PlanarNeRF, a novel approach for detecting dense 3D planar primitives using online learning, integrating insights from both the scene's appearance and its geometric attributes.

2. Development of a lightweight plane fitting module, estimating plane parameters for sparsely sampled points. 

3. Establishment of a novel global memory bank module with an update mechanism, ensuring consistent tracking of plane instances and facilitating plane label generation.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of a new deep learning framework called PlanarNeRF that can effectively detect 3D planar primitives from RGB-D videos in an online, self-supervised manner while maintaining consistency across frames. The lightweight plane fitting and global memory bank modules specifically enable efficient online plane estimation and consistent plane tracking over time.
