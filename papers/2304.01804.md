# [Bridging the Gap between Model Explanations in Partially Annotated
  Multi-label Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01804)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is: How do false negative labels affect the model explanation in partially annotated multi-label image classification, and how can we mitigate the effects? 

Specifically, the paper investigates how assuming unobserved labels as negative labels (i.e. false negatives) impacts the class activation maps (CAMs) that explain the model's predictions. The key findings are:

- The overall spatial structure/shape of the CAMs is preserved, but the attribution scores are lowered, especially for positive labels. 

- This drop in attribution scores for positive labels leads to lower prediction scores.

Based on these observations, the paper proposes a simple method called BoostReLU to compensate for the damaged attribution scores by boosting the scores in highlighted CAM regions. This helps bridge the gap between the explanation of models trained with full vs. partial labels.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that boosting attribution scores in CAMs can mitigate the negative effects of false negative labels on model explanations in partially labeled multi-label classification. The proposed BoostReLU method is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called BoostReLU to improve the performance of partially annotated multi-label image classification. The key ideas are:

- Analyzing how false negative labels (unannotated positive labels that are incorrectly assumed negative) affect the class activation maps (CAM) of models trained with partial vs full labels. They find the overall CAM structure is similar but attribution scores drop for the partial label model. 

- Proposing BoostReLU, a simple function that boosts high attribution scores in the CAM to compensate for the score drop caused by false negatives. This makes the partial label model CAM more similar to the full label model CAM.

- Applying BoostReLU during inference improves performance on the partial label baseline model without retraining. Combining it with methods that correct false negatives during training leads to further gains.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, NUSWIDE, and OpenImages datasets by applying BoostReLU with recent false negative correction methods.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple and effective technique to bridge the gap between model explanations under partial vs full supervision by boosting damaged CAM scores, which also improves multi-label classification performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a method to bridge the gap between model explanations in partially annotated multi-label classification. The key idea is to boost the attribution scores of a model trained with partial labels to resemble those of a model trained with full labels, which improves performance. The main contribution is a simple function called BoostLU that compensates for score damage caused by false negative labels in the partial label setting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several contributions to multi-label image classification with partially annotated training data:

- It analyzes how false negative label noise affects model explanations generated by class activation mapping (CAM). The key finding is that while the overall spatial structure of the CAM is preserved, the attribution scores are lowered, especially for positive labels. 

- Motivated by this analysis, the authors propose a simple but effective BoostLU function to compensate for the reduced CAM scores by boosting the scores above a threshold. 

- They demonstrate three usage scenarios for BoostLU: inference only, training+inference, and in combination with recent methods that detect/modify likely false negatives during training. The last approach performs best.

- Experiments on four standard datasets show that adding BoostLU to state-of-the-art methods for handling partial labels boosts performance significantly. The combined approach achieves new state-of-the-art results.

The key differences from related work are:

- The CAM analysis provides new insights into how false negatives affect model explanations in multi-label classification. This is a different finding than in prior work on CAM for noisy single-label classification [1].

- BoostLU is simpler than prior methods for handling false negatives like loss correction/rejection [2], asymmetric loss [3], or entropy maximization [4]. It improves performance at very little extra cost.

- Using BoostLU in combination with recent false negative detection methods [2] is novel and achieves better results than either technique alone.

Overall, this paper makes both empirical and methodological contributions for multi-label classification with missing labels. The CAM analysis and effective BoostLU approach are the key novel elements compared to related work.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the conclusion:

- Extending the method to video classification tasks to leverage the temporal information. The authors note that it would be interesting to study how to apply BoostReLU to leveraging temporal cues across video frames.

- Combining BoostReLU with other noise-robust methods like mentor networks and self-supervised learning to further improve robustness. The authors suggest it could be promising to integrate BoostReLU with other techniques for handling noisy labels.

- Refining the form of BoostReLU. The authors mention that the simple piecewise-linear form of BoostReLU was effective, but exploring other potential forms could further optimize it.

- Adapting BoostReLU for other types of label noise beyond false negatives in multi-label classification. The authors suggest investigating using ideas like BoostReLU to handle other types of label noise.

- Analyzing the effect of partial annotation and false negatives on model understanding/explanation in other domains beyond vision. The authors propose it could be interesting to study the impact on model explanations in other application areas like NLP.

In summary, the main future directions are: leveraging BoostReLU for video and other data modalities, integrating it with other noise-robust methods, further optimizing the form of BoostReLU, expanding it to other types of label noise, and analyzing the effect in other problem domains beyond vision. The core idea seems to be taking the insights from BoostReLU and applying them more broadly.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method to improve the performance of partially annotated multi-label image classification models by enhancing their explanations. The key ideas are:

- Analyze class activation maps (CAMs) from models trained with full vs partial labels. Find that partial labels mainly reduce high attribution scores but keep overall spatial structure. 

- Propose BoostReLU, a piecewise linear function that boosts high attribution scores in CAMs from partial label models. This makes their explanations more similar to full label models.

- Apply BoostReLU during inference, training, or both. Show it improves performance, especially when combined with recent methods that correct large losses (false negatives). 

- BoostReLU helps detect more false negatives during training. It boosts their scores so they are more likely to be corrected.

- Achieve state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, NUS-WIDE, OpenImages by applying BoostReLU with large loss correction methods. Improve performance while adding minimal computation cost.

In summary, the paper bridges the gap between explanations of partial and full label models by boosting damaged attribution scores in CAMs, which also helps correct false negatives during training. This simple but effective approach advances the state-of-the-art for partially annotated multi-label image classification.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called BoostReLU to improve the performance of partially annotated multi-label image classification models. In multi-label classification, images can have multiple labels and annotating all possible labels is expensive. A common approach is to assume unannotated labels as negative, but this introduces false negatives which damage the model. 

The key idea is to analyze the class activation maps (CAMs) from models trained with full and partial annotation. Although CAMs highlight similar regions, the attribution scores are lower with partial annotation. The proposed BoostReLU boosts the scores in highlighted regions to make the CAMs more similar. Experiments show BoostReLU improves performance when applied during inference or combined with methods that handle false negatives during training. On PASCAL VOC, COCO, NUS-WIDE, and OpenImages datasets, BoostReLU achieves state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between explanations of models trained with full and partial annotation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called BoostReLU to improve the performance of partially annotated multi-label image classification. The key ideas are:

- The paper first analyzes how false negative labels, which arise from assuming unobserved labels as negative, affect the class activation maps (CAM) that explain the model's predictions. It finds that false negatives mainly reduce the scale of attribution scores in CAM while preserving the overall spatial structure. 

- Based on this observation, the paper introduces BoostReLU, a piecewise linear function that boosts the high attribution scores in CAM that are most affected by false negatives. By applying BoostReLU to the model's CAM output, it helps compensate for the damage caused by false negatives.

- BoostReLU can be flexibly used in three scenarios: 1) during inference only, 2) during both training and inference, and 3) in combination with recent methods that detect and modify losses from likely false negatives during training. The third scenario gives the best results by amplifying the model's ability to identify false negatives.

- Experiments show that even the conceptually simple BoostReLU leads to significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on several partially annotated multi-label image datasets. The key advantage is making the model's explanation more closely resemble that of a model trained with full labels.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of partially annotated multi-label image classification, where only a subset of labels are provided for each training image. Specifically, it focuses on the issue of false negative labels that are introduced when assuming unannotated labels to be negative, and studies how these false negatives affect the model's explanations. 

The key questions the paper investigates are:

- How do false negative labels influence the class activation maps (CAMs) that explain the model's predictions?

- Can we compensate for the damage caused by false negatives to make the model's explanations more similar to a fully annotated model?

- Does compensating for the damaged explanations also improve the model's classification performance?

The paper finds that false negatives mainly reduce the attribution scores in the CAMs but do not affect the overall spatial structure. Based on this observation, the authors propose a simple method called BoostReLU to boost the damaged attribution scores and make the explanation more similar to a fully labeled model. They show this not only improves the explanation but also the classification accuracy, especially when combined with recent methods that explicitly handle false negatives during training.

In summary, the key contribution is studying the effect of false negatives on model explanations in partially labeled multi-label classification, and proposing a method to compensate for the damage that also improves classification performance. The main goal is to bridge the gap between explanations of models trained with full and partial labels.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

- Class activation maps (CAM) - The paper analyzes CAMs, which provide visual explanations for CNN predictions, to study the difference between models trained with full vs partial labels. 

- Boosted gradients - The proposed BoostReLU method boosts gradients to pixels with high attribution scores in the CAM, enhancing learning from positive labels while large loss modification handles false negatives.

- State-of-the-art results - The method achieves SOTA results on several datasets (PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, NUS-WIDE, OpenImages) by combining BoostReLU with recent large loss modification techniques for handling false negatives in partial label learning.

- Simple and effective - A conceptually simple method that effectively bridges the gap between explanations of models trained with full vs partial labels, leading to performance gains at minimal extra computational cost.

In summary, the key focus is studying the impact of false negatives in partial label learning on model explanations, and proposing a lightweight method to compensate for this by boosting gradients guided by class activation maps.
