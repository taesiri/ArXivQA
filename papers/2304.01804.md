# [Bridging the Gap between Model Explanations in Partially Annotated   Multi-label Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01804)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper aims to address is: How do false negative labels affect the model explanation in partially annotated multi-label image classification, and how can we mitigate the effects? Specifically, the paper investigates how assuming unobserved labels as negative labels (i.e. false negatives) impacts the class activation maps (CAMs) that explain the model's predictions. The key findings are:- The overall spatial structure/shape of the CAMs is preserved, but the attribution scores are lowered, especially for positive labels. - This drop in attribution scores for positive labels leads to lower prediction scores.Based on these observations, the paper proposes a simple method called BoostReLU to compensate for the damaged attribution scores by boosting the scores in highlighted CAM regions. This helps bridge the gap between the explanation of models trained with full vs. partial labels.In summary, the central hypothesis is that boosting attribution scores in CAMs can mitigate the negative effects of false negative labels on model explanations in partially labeled multi-label classification. The proposed BoostReLU method is designed to test this hypothesis.
