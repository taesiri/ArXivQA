# [The Ultimate Combo: Boosting Adversarial Example Transferability by   Composing Data Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Transferring adversarial examples (AEs) crafted on surrogate models to target models is commonly used to evaluate adversarial robustness in black-box settings. Prior work has shown that integrating certain data augmentations like random resizing into attacks can enhance AE transferability. However, only a limited set of augmentations have been explored so far and their composition has not been systematically studied. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper conducts a systematic study on how different data augmentation techniques can impact transferability when applied individually or in combination. Specifically, the authors explore 46 augmentation methods spanning 7 categories like color transformations, spatial transformations etc. They propose a parallel composition framework to flexibly integrate multiple augmentations into attacks. Using this, they perform an exhaustive search on a subset of augmentations to find the best performing combination (called UltComb). They also use genetic search to identify effective compositions from the full set of 46 augmentations (called UltCombGen).

Main Contributions:

1. Simple color space augmentations like grayscale convert perform comparably or better than state-of-the-art techniques for boosting transferability.

2. Parallel composition of augmentations is shown to improve transferability over serial composition used in prior work. Transferability has a mostly monotonic relationship with number of augmentations composed.

3. Attacks integrating the best combinations found via exhaustive (UltComb) and genetic search (UltCombGen) significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art attacks. For example, on ImageNet, average transferability improves from 85% for best baseline to 92.6% for UltCombGen.

4. Theoretical analysis shows certain augmentations smooth model gradients, limiting impact of surrogate peculiarities. This is empirically validated and explains when augmentations help transferability.

In summary, this paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art in crafting transferable adversarial examples by systematically studying data augmentations and discovering new effective compositions through exhaustive and genetic search.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically studies how different data augmentation techniques, applied individually or in combination, impact the transferability of adversarial examples from surrogate models to target models in black-box attack settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors systematically study a broad range of data augmentation techniques (46 in total across 7 categories) and assess their impact on adversarial example transferability when applied individually or in combination. Prior work had only looked at a very limited set of augmentations for improving transferability.

2) The authors propose a parallel composition framework to integrate multiple augmentations into attacks, which enables scaling to a large number of techniques. They show this composition outperforms prior serial composition approaches when more augmentations are used.

3) Through exhaustive search on a subset of augmentations, the authors discover a mostly monotonic relationship between number of augmentations used and transferability. More augmentations leads to better or equal transferability.

4) Using genetic search over all 46 augmentation techniques, the authors identify combinations of 33 augmentations that significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art attacks, achieving over 90% average transferability on ImageNet compared to previous best of 82.7%.

5) The authors provide theoretical analysis, backed by experiments, explaining why certain augmentations can smooth model gradients and thereby improve transferability.

In summary, the key contribution is a systematic methodology to assess, compose, and optimize data augmentations for black-box adversarial attacks that leads to new state-of-the-art attack transferability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Adversarial examples (AEs) - Variants of benign inputs that are minimally perturbed to induce misclassification. The paper focuses on techniques to generate AEs that can transfer between models.

- Transferability - The phenomenon where AEs crafted to mislead one model can also mislead other models. The paper aims to systematically study data augmentation techniques to boost transferability.

- Data augmentation - Transformation techniques originally used to help machine learning models generalize. The paper explores using 46 data augmentation methods, applied individually or in combination, to enhance AE transferability. 

- Exhaustive search - Method used in the paper to evaluate all possible compositions of a subset of augmentations to characterize the relationship between augmentations and transferability.

- Genetic search - Efficient search technique used to discover effective augmentation combinations by mimicking biological evolution.

- Parallel composition - Proposed approach to flexibly combine many augmentations by applying them independently to inputs. Shows better performance than previous serial composition.

- Gradient smoothness - The paper provides theory and evidence that certain augmentations help smooth model gradients, leading to more transferable AEs.

- State-of-the-art attacks - The discovered augmentation combinations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art attacks at transferring AEs between models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a flexible framework (Algorithm 1) for integrating data augmentation into evasion attacks to improve transferability. How does this framework allow exploring a wide range of augmentation techniques compared to prior work? What are the key components that enable this?

2. The paper systematically studies 46 augmentation techniques across 7 categories. What is the motivation behind exploring augmentations originally proposed for improving model generalization on clean images? Why might they also help with transferability of adversarial examples? 

3. The paper proposes parallel composition of augmentations in attacks, unlike prior work using serial composition. What is the key difference between parallel and serial composition? Why does parallel composition allow scaling to more augmentation techniques?

4. What search strategies does the paper use for discovering effective compositions of augmentations? What are the tradeoffs between exhaustive and genetic search? Why is genetic search still useful despite the observed monotonic relationship between augmentations and transferability?

5. How does the paper aim to provide theoretical justifications regarding why certain augmentations are useful for improving transferability? What properties of augmentations make gradients smoother and less sensitive to peculiarities of the surrogate model?

6. The proposed best combination, UltCombBase, from exhaustive search uses 7 augmentation techniques. How much does the larger combination, UltCombGen, from genetic search with 33 techniques, further improve average transferability rates on ImageNet?

7. What trends does the paper observe regarding augmentations that hurt benign test accuracy on surrogates? How do these align with empirical observations on when augmentations help or hurt transferability? 

8. For computational efficiency, the paper parallelizes most augmentations but serially composes some core techniques from prior work. How much does fully serial composition hurt transferability and why?

9. How does the number of augmented samples per attack iteration impact runtime? What choices help balance runtime vs transferability for the proposed attacks?

10. How effectively do the best proposed combinations transfer attacks to commercially deployed models compared to prior art? Could the findings translate to helping adversaries evade real-world systems?
