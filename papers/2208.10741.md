# [Hierarchically Decomposed Graph Convolutional Networks for   Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10741)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on developing a graph convolutional network architecture for skeleton-based human action recognition that can effectively model long-range dependencies between joints. The key ideas proposed are:

- A hierarchically decomposed graph (HD-Graph) that divides the skeleton into hierarchical sets of joints/nodes to model relationships between structurally distant joints along with adjacent joints. 

- An attention-guided hierarchy aggregation (A-HA) module to highlight the most relevant hierarchies for each input skeleton sequence.

- A six-way ensemble method that trains models on different HD-Graphs without using motion stream data.

The central hypothesis seems to be that explicitly modeling long-range relationships between joints in a hierarchical manner and selectively focusing on relevant joint hierarchies using attention will improve action recognition performance compared to prior graph-based methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HD-GCN architecture on standard action recognition benchmarks.

In summary, the key innovation is a hierarchical graph decomposition approach plus attention to model long-range joint dependencies for enhanced skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a hierarchically decomposed graph (HD-Graph) to model relationships between both adjacent and distant joints in a skeleton. The graph decomposes joints into hierarchical sets and connects all nodes between adjacent sets to capture long-range dependencies.

- Introducing an attention-guided hierarchy aggregation (A-HA) module to highlight the most relevant hierarchical features for each sample. This uses representative spatial average pooling (RSAP) and hierarchical edge convolution (H-EdgeConv). 

- Presenting a six-way ensemble method without motion streams that achieves state-of-the-art performance. This uses joint and bone streams with three different HD-Graphs.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on four large action recognition benchmarks (NTU-RGB+D 60/120, Kinetics-Skeleton, Northwestern-UCLA) using the proposed HD-Graph Convolutional Network (HD-GCN).

The key ideas are designing a graph to better model skeletal relationships, learning sample-specific hierarchies with attention, and an effective ensemble approach. The HD-GCN with these contributions sets new state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.
