# [Hierarchically Decomposed Graph Convolutional Networks for   Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10741)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on developing a graph convolutional network architecture for skeleton-based human action recognition that can effectively model long-range dependencies between joints. The key ideas proposed are:

- A hierarchically decomposed graph (HD-Graph) that divides the skeleton into hierarchical sets of joints/nodes to model relationships between structurally distant joints along with adjacent joints. 

- An attention-guided hierarchy aggregation (A-HA) module to highlight the most relevant hierarchies for each input skeleton sequence.

- A six-way ensemble method that trains models on different HD-Graphs without using motion stream data.

The central hypothesis seems to be that explicitly modeling long-range relationships between joints in a hierarchical manner and selectively focusing on relevant joint hierarchies using attention will improve action recognition performance compared to prior graph-based methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HD-GCN architecture on standard action recognition benchmarks.

In summary, the key innovation is a hierarchical graph decomposition approach plus attention to model long-range joint dependencies for enhanced skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a hierarchically decomposed graph (HD-Graph) to model relationships between both adjacent and distant joints in a skeleton. The graph decomposes joints into hierarchical sets and connects all nodes between adjacent sets to capture long-range dependencies.

- Introducing an attention-guided hierarchy aggregation (A-HA) module to highlight the most relevant hierarchical features for each sample. This uses representative spatial average pooling (RSAP) and hierarchical edge convolution (H-EdgeConv). 

- Presenting a six-way ensemble method without motion streams that achieves state-of-the-art performance. This uses joint and bone streams with three different HD-Graphs.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on four large action recognition benchmarks (NTU-RGB+D 60/120, Kinetics-Skeleton, Northwestern-UCLA) using the proposed HD-Graph Convolutional Network (HD-GCN).

The key ideas are designing a graph to better model skeletal relationships, learning sample-specific hierarchies with attention, and an effective ensemble approach. The HD-GCN with these contributions sets new state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hierarchically decomposed graph convolutional network architecture and attention mechanism for skeleton-based human action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other research in skeleton-based action recognition:

- The key contribution of this paper is proposing a new graph convolution architecture called HD-GCN, along with a hierarchical decomposition of the human skeleton graph (HD-Graph) and attention module (A-HA). This differentiates it from prior work like ST-GCN, 2s-AGCN, etc. that use a fixed graph topology.

- The HD-Graph allows capturing long-range dependencies between joints by connecting nodes across hierarchies. This addresses a limitation of most prior GCN methods that only model local joint relationships. The A-HA module further helps identify important joints/hierarchies for each sample.

- The HD-GCN achieves state-of-the-art results on major datasets like NTU-RGB+D, Kinetics, and Northwestern-UCLA. This demonstrates its effectiveness over recent methods like MS-G3D, Shift-GCN, DDGCN, etc. 

- The proposed six-way ensemble technique without using motion streams is also novel. Most prior works use four streams including motion, whereas HD-GCN shows competitive performance with only joint and bone streams.

- Compared to some other state-of-the-art methods like InfoGCN, the HD-GCN has lower computational complexity in terms of FLOPs and parameters. So it is more efficient.

- The introduction of meaningful long-range dependencies in the graph, flexibility to emphasize important joints/hierarchies per sample, and ensemble technique make HD-GCN an impactful advancement over prior graph-based methods for skeleton action recognition. The strong experimental results validate this.

In summary, the key strengths of this paper are the novel graph architecture, attention scheme, and training methodology that advance the state-of-the-art in this field. The empirical gains over current methods demonstrate the value of its contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different hierarchical decomposition strategies and comparing their effectiveness. The authors use a specific way of hierarchically decomposing the skeleton graph, but mention that other decomposition approaches could be explored as well. 

- Applying the proposed methods to other graph neural network architectures beyond the specific backbone network used in this work. The authors demonstrate their approach on a particular GCN architecture, but suggest it could be integrated into other graph network models.

- Extending the hierarchical graph decomposition and attention mechanisms to dynamic graphs that change over time. The current work focuses on static graph representations, but adapting it to dynamic/temporal graphs is noted as an area for future work.

- Evaluating the proposed HD-GCN on a wider range of skeleton-based action recognition datasets beyond the ones used in this paper. The authors recommend assessing their approach on additional benchmark datasets.

- Exploring different ensemble strategies beyond the six-way approach presented. The paper introduces a new ensemble method, but other ensemble techniques could be investigated as well.

- Applying the model components like the HD-Graph and attention module to other graph-based tasks beyond just action recognition. The general techniques could be relevant for other problems involving graph structured data.

So in summary, the main suggestions are around exploring variations of their hierarchical graph decomposition and attention mechanisms, applying the approach to new models/tasks/datasets, and investigating different ensemble methods. Overall, there seem to be many interesting research directions building off this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a hierarchically decomposed graph convolutional network (HD-GCN) architecture with a novel hierarchically decomposed graph (HD-Graph) for skeleton-based action recognition. The key ideas are:

- The HD-Graph decomposes joint nodes into hierarchical sets to extract structurally adjacent and distant edges in the same semantic spaces of the human skeleton. This identifies relationships between distant joints. 

- An attention-guided hierarchy aggregation (A-HA) module highlights dominant hierarchical edge sets of the HD-Graph. It uses representative spatial average pooling and hierarchical edge convolution.

- A six-way ensemble method leverages multiple HD-Graphs with different center of mass nodes and joint/bone streams, removing the need for motion streams. 

- Experiments on NTU-RGB+D, Kinetics-Skeleton, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets show state-of-the-art performance. Ablations demonstrate the contributions of the HD-Graph, A-HA module, and ensemble method.

In summary, the paper presents a novel graph decomposition and attention method to better model joint relationships in skeleton-based action recognition, achieving superior results. The proposed techniques help capture both local and global context in human actions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a hierarchically decomposed graph convolutional network (HD-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. The key contribution is a hierarchically decomposed graph (HD-Graph) that represents the human skeleton as sets of joints at different hierarchical levels. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies between distant joints, overcoming limitations of prior graphs that only connect physically adjacent joints. The HD-Graph connects all joints within each hierarchical set using fully connected edges. The paper also proposes an attention module called attention-guided hierarchy aggregation (A-HA) that learns to focus on the most relevant hierarchical feature sets for each input sample. This avoids simply aggregating all feature sets, which can lead to suboptimal performance. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art results using the proposed HD-GCN with 6-way ensemble, outperforming prior methods without needing motion stream data.

In summary, this paper makes several key contributions for skeleton-based action recognition: (1) The HD-Graph represents the skeleton hierarchically to capture long-range dependencies between joints. (2) The A-HA module learns to focus on the most relevant joint hierarchies for each input. (3) A 6-way ensemble approach boosts performance without needing motion stream data. (4) State-of-the-art results are achieved on four benchmark datasets. The proposed techniques provide an effective way to model complex spatio-temporal relationships in skeleton data for improved action recognition.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method presented in this paper is a graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture called Hierarchically Decomposed Graph Convolutional Network (HD-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. 

The key ideas are:

- Proposing a novel Hierarchically Decomposed Graph (HD-Graph) that decomposes the human skeleton joints into hierarchical sets and identifies relationships between both nearby and distant joints in the skeleton. The graph connects nodes in adjacent hierarchies to capture long-range dependencies.

- Introducing an Attention-Guided Hierarchy Aggregation (A-HA) module that applies attention across the hierarchical features from the HD-Graph to highlight the most important hierarchies for each input sample. This uses a Representative Spatial Average Pooling layer and Hierarchical Edge Convolution.

- Using a six-way ensemble method without relying on motion stream data as previous methods. This trains separate models on joint and bone streams using three different HD-Graphs with different center of mass nodes. 

The HD-GCN combines the HD-Graph, A-HA module, and six-way ensemble to achieve state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark skeleton action recognition datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a new architecture for graph convolutional networks (GCNs) applied to skeleton-based human action recognition. The key points are:

- The paper aims to address limitations of previous GCN approaches for skeleton action recognition, which rely on handcrafted graphs that only model adjacent joint connections. This limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies between distant joints. 

- The authors propose a "Hierarchically Decomposed Graph" (HD-Graph) which models connections between joints in the same semantic space (e.g. left/right hands, left/right feet). This allows capturing long-range dependencies while still maintaining semantic meaning.

- An attention mechanism called Attention-Guided Hierarchy Aggregation (A-HA) is introduced to highlight the most important joints/connections for each sample. This helps the model focus on the most relevant joints and connections depending on the action.

- They propose a 6-way ensemble method to combine models trained on different versions of the HD-Graph, improving overall performance without needing motion data streams commonly used in other ensemble approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a hierarchical graph decomposition and attention mechanism to improve modeling of long-range dependencies in skeleton action recognition using graph convolutional networks. The overall approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.
