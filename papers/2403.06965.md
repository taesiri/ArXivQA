# [Hybrid Human-LLM Corpus Construction and LLM Evaluation for Rare   Linguistic Phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06965)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Argument structure constructions (ASCs) like the caused-motion construction (CMC, e.g. "She sneezed the foam off her cappuccino") are challenging for large language models (LLMs) to understand. This is because constructions carry meaning that is not captured by just the lexical meaning of the individual words.
- Studying the competence of LLMs on such linguistic phenomena is difficult due to the lack of adequately annotated evaluation data. Manual annotation is very costly for rare phenomena like the CMC. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a pipeline to create a CMC corpus in a cost-effective way, using spaCy dependency parsing to prefilter sentences and then classify the parsed sentences with GPT-3.5 to further concentrate likely positive instances.
- Optimize prompts to GPT-3.5 to maximize accuracy while minimizing total cost.
- Created one corpus of 765 manually verified CMC instances and a bigger corpus of 127,955 likely CMC sentences.

Evaluation:  
- Test various LLMs on understanding the CMC by asking if direct object is moving physically in a sentence and then substituting the verb with a prototypical motion verb and asking again.
- Observe that no LLM achieves over 70% accuracy, with 30%+ error rates. Demonstrates LLMs still lack deeper understanding of complex language phenomena.

Main Contributions:
- Novel semi-automated corpus creation pipeline using dependency parsing and GPT-3.5 prompts.
- Release of two new CMC focused evaluation datasets.
- Analysis highlighting lack of understanding of CMC construction across state-of-the-art LLMs.
