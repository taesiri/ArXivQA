# [Hybrid Human-LLM Corpus Construction and LLM Evaluation for Rare   Linguistic Phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06965)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Argument structure constructions (ASCs) like the caused-motion construction (CMC, e.g. "She sneezed the foam off her cappuccino") are challenging for large language models (LLMs) to understand. This is because constructions carry meaning that is not captured by just the lexical meaning of the individual words.
- Studying the competence of LLMs on such linguistic phenomena is difficult due to the lack of adequately annotated evaluation data. Manual annotation is very costly for rare phenomena like the CMC. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a pipeline to create a CMC corpus in a cost-effective way, using spaCy dependency parsing to prefilter sentences and then classify the parsed sentences with GPT-3.5 to further concentrate likely positive instances.
- Optimize prompts to GPT-3.5 to maximize accuracy while minimizing total cost.
- Created one corpus of 765 manually verified CMC instances and a bigger corpus of 127,955 likely CMC sentences.

Evaluation:  
- Test various LLMs on understanding the CMC by asking if direct object is moving physically in a sentence and then substituting the verb with a prototypical motion verb and asking again.
- Observe that no LLM achieves over 70% accuracy, with 30%+ error rates. Demonstrates LLMs still lack deeper understanding of complex language phenomena.

Main Contributions:
- Novel semi-automated corpus creation pipeline using dependency parsing and GPT-3.5 prompts.
- Release of two new CMC focused evaluation datasets.
- Analysis highlighting lack of understanding of CMC construction across state-of-the-art LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel hybrid human-LLM pipeline for efficient annotation of rare linguistic phenomena, applies it to create a corpus of the caused-motion construction, and finds that current LLMs still struggle in properly understanding this phenomenon.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel annotation pipeline that combines dependency parsing and prompting GPT-3.5 to minimize the cost of collecting linguistic data for rare phenomena. The pipeline is designed to maximize the number of positive, manually verified instances while reducing costs.

2. Releasing two new datasets - one with 765 manually annotated instances of the caused-motion construction, and another with 127,955 automatically extracted likely instances. 

3. Evaluating several state-of-the-art language models (GPT, Llama2, Mistral, Gemini) on their understanding of the caused-motion construction using the collected dataset. The results show that all models still struggle with this phenomenon, with error rates over 30%, highlighting gaps in language understanding.

So in summary, the main contributions are:

(1) A new hybrid human-LLM annotation pipeline 

(2) Two new datasets of the caused-motion construction

(3) An evaluation of LLMs on the caused-motion construction demonstrating gaps in understanding


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Caused-motion construction (CMC): A linguistic phenomenon where a verb describes an action that results in motion or change of location of a specific object. A core concept examined in the paper.

- Construction Grammar (CxG): A theory of grammar where grammatical constructions (like the CMC) themselves carry meaning, rather than just the individual words. Relevant for explaining why the CMC poses challenges. 

- Argument Structure Constructions (ASCs): Well-studied grammatical constructions that connect verbs to their arguments. CMC is an example of an ASC.

- Large Language Models (LLMs): State-of-the-art neural network models like GPT-3 that are trained on large amounts of text data. Evaluated in the paper for their understanding of the CMC. 

- Prompt engineering: Designing effective prompts to query LLMs. Detailed in the paper as part of the data collection pipeline.

- Annotation pipeline: A proposed hybrid human-LLM pipeline to collect linguistic data. Combines dependency parsing, prompting GPT-3.5, and human annotation. 

- Evaluation: Testing different LLM models on a question answering task to assess their understanding of the CMC based on a collected evaluation dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel annotation pipeline combining dependency parsing and prompting GPT-3.5. What are the key advantages and limitations of this hybrid approach compared to having human annotators label the entire corpus?

2. The paper aims to minimize the cost per true positive instance. What are some ways the cost formulation in Equation 1 could be extended, for example to also account for diversity of instances or annotation time? 

3. The prompt engineering process involves iterative refinement of prompts. What guidelines can be formulated for developing effective prompts in an economical way? How could this process be further streamlined?

4. The paper extracts structural information (verb, arguments etc.) as a byproduct of the dependency parsing step. In what ways could this information be utilized beyond filtering and prompt design?

5. The evaluation results show the CMC remains challenging for LLMs. What are some possible reasons even large LLMs struggle? How could the models or training regimen be improved to better handle constructions?  

6. The paper focuses only on the CMC but the method could be applied to other constructions. What are some foreseen challenges in adapting the approach, especially the prompt design, to other less studied constructions?

7. The automatically annotated larger corpus is based on projecting annotations using the verb and arguments. What are some ways to estimate or improve the precision of this automatic projection?

8. What kind of human annotator guidelines and interfacing would be most effective for the kind of phenomenon targeted in this paper? How could the guidelines be optimized?

9. The paper performs a binary classification of whether a sentence exhibits the CMC or not. How could the method be extended to identify subtypes of the CMC in a multi-class scenario?

10. The paper proposes a way to numerically estimate cost tradeoffs between API usage and human annotation. How could this formulation be used for prompt selection or annotation budgeting in practice?
