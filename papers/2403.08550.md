# [CINA: Conditional Implicit Neural Atlas for Spatio-Temporal   Representation of Fetal Brains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the challenge of constructing a spatio-temporal atlas of the developing fetal brain from magnetic resonance images (MRI). Existing atlas construction methods rely on compute-intensive non-rigid registration between images and are limited to discrete time points and spatial resolutions. More critically, they typically only represent normative neurotypical brains and fail to adequately capture anatomical variations and developmental patterns of pathological fetal brains.

Proposed Method
The paper proposes a conditional implicit neural atlas (CINA) based on implicit neural representations. CINA learns a continuous function that maps spatial coordinates and a latent code to intensity and segmentation probability values, representing a full spatio-temporal atlas. Each training subject has a unique latent code that encapsulates subject-specific anatomical features. After training, CINA can generate a brain atlas for any age and spatial resolution by regressing appropriate latent codes. It can also condition on specific anatomical features like ventricular volume or cortical folding during training and interpolation.

Key Contributions
- CINA represents the first conditional implicit neural atlas for spatio-temporal modeling of fetal brains 
- It provides a compact and resolution-agnostic representation that can generate atlases of arbitrary temporal and spatial resolution
- CINA encapsulates neurotypical as well as pathological anatomy and developmental patterns
- Conditioning on anatomical features allows tailored atlas generation for sub-populations 
- Evaluation on 198 fetal MRI scans shows accurate atlas-based segmentation and age prediction compared to an existing atlas, especially for pathological cases

In summary, CINA puts forth a flexible, continuous, and compact neural atlas representation for fetal brains, capable of modeling neurotypical and pathological anatomy across gestational time points. Conditioning enables tailored atlases for focused analyses.
