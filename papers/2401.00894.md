# [Balanced Multi-modal Federated Learning via Cross-Modal Infiltration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal federated learning (MFL) aims to train a shared global model using distributed multimodal data from clients while preserving data privacy.  
- Existing MFL methods have focused on tackling statistical or modality heterogeneity in the input data. However, they overlook a critical issue - modality imbalance that occurs during the learning process. 
- Modality imbalance refers to inconsistent learning paces of different modalities, where dominant modalities can inhibit weaker ones, leading to underutilization of information. This is further exacerbated by heterogeneity across clients.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Cross-Modal Infiltration Federated Learning (FedCMI) framework to address modality imbalance and knowledge heterogeneity.

- The key idea is to transfer knowledge from the global dominant modality to the local weak modality while still maintaining the information exploitation of each modality. 

- A two-projector module is designed - the infiltration projector integrates knowledge from the dominant modality and the self-projector promotes feature exploitation of the weak modality. This allows weak modalities to preserve multimodal knowledge without solely imitating dominant ones.

- A class-wise temperature adaptation scheme is also introduced to alleviate biased knowledge across different classes for the weak modality.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes FedCMI, a novel MFL framework to address challenges from jointly considering modality imbalance and input heterogeneity.

- Designs a two-projector architecture to stimulate weak modalities by transferring dominant modality knowledge while retaining local feature exploitation.

- Introduces a class-wise temperature adaptation to mitigate knowledge bias through different classes.

- Achieves significant performance improvements over baselines on two audio-visual datasets and an image-text dataset. Demonstrates effectiveness in tackling heterogeneous inhibition and inconsistent class-wise performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a cross-modal infiltration federated learning framework to alleviate heterogeneous modality imbalance and insufficient multimodal information exploitation among distributed clients by integrating knowledge from the dominant modality to boost the learning of weak modality while maintaining each modality's own feature exploitation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel multimodal federated learning (MFL) framework called FedCMI (Cross-Modal Infiltration Federated Learning) to address the challenges of jointly considering modality imbalance and input heterogeneity in MFL. 

2) The two-projector design in FedCMI transfers knowledge from the global dominant modality to the local weak modality while still maintaining the information exploitation of each modality. It also proposes a class-wise temperature adaptation scheme to alleviate knowledge bias across different classes.

3) It conducts comprehensive experiments on popular multimodal datasets which demonstrate that FedCMI can achieve considerable improvements in performance over baselines in various MFL scenarios. The ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of each component in the framework.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel FedCMI framework that can effectively perform knowledge transfer from the global dominant modality to facilitate learning of the weak modality in MFL, while handling issues like modality imbalance, input heterogeneity, and biased knowledge across classes. This allows better utilization of multimodal data in distributed learning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Multimodal federated learning (MFL): The paper focuses on training multimodal models in a federated learning setting where data is distributed across clients. 

- Modality imbalance: A key issue in multimodal learning where different modalities learn at different speeds, inhibiting weaker modalities. The paper aims to address this.

- Input heterogeneity: The diversity in data distributions and modalities available across different clients in federated learning.

- Cross-modal infiltration: The proposed method of transferring knowledge from the dominant global modality to the weaker local modalities to balance multimodal learning.  

- Two-projector module: The module with separate projectors for self-learning and cross-modal distillation to allow integrating external knowledge while preserving self-information.

- Class-wise temperature adaptation: A technique proposed to alleviate bias in knowledge transfer across different classes.

- Heterogeneous modality inhibition: The inhibition of weaker modalities that varies significantly across clients due to differences in data distributions.

So in summary, key terms cover multimodal federated learning, modality imbalance, knowledge transfer across modalities, the proposed infiltration framework, and issues tackled like heterogeneous inhibition across clients and classes.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-projector architecture for integrating knowledge from the dominant modality while still promoting local feature exploitation. Can you explain the rationale behind using two separate projectors instead of a single projector? What are the advantages of this approach?

2. The class-wise temperature adaptation scheme is used to mitigate bias in knowledge transfer across different classes. How exactly does modulating the temperature on a per-class basis help achieve this goal? 

3. What is the core motivation behind transferring knowledge from the global dominant modality to the local weak modality? Why is the global dominant modality a good source of knowledge for the local weak modalities?

4. How does the proposed method address the challenge of heterogeneous modality inhibition across different clients? What causes this heterogeneity and why is it an issue?

5. The shared classifier between the two projectors is said to promote consistent convergence. Can you explain the reasoning behind why a shared classifier enables complementary information between modalities to be retained?

6. How does FedCMI differ from existing knowledge distillation techniques for cross-modal transfer learning? What limitations does it overcome?

7. What modifications would need to be made to FedCMI to handle more than two modalities? What new challenges might arise in that setting?

8. Under what circumstances might directly imitating the dominant modality lead to reduced performance for the weak modality? When might imitation be an effective strategy?

9. How is the proposed method complementary to existing federated learning algorithms that address statistical heterogeneity? Could those algorithms be combined with FedCMI?

10. The method does not require explicit modality disentanglement. What are the advantages of avoiding disentanglement, and when might it still be beneficial?
