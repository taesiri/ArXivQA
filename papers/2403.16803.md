# [Exploiting Priors from 3D Diffusion Models for RGB-Based One-Shot View   Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Object reconstruction is important for autonomous robots to interact with environments. A key challenge is to plan sensor view configurations that maximize information for reconstructing initially unknown objects while minimizing robot travel distance/time. Without prior knowledge, next-best-view (NBV) planning is commonly used but it is greedy and inefficient. One-shot view planning predicts all views at once for global optimization but requires geometric priors about the object, which are unavailable from RGB images.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel one-shot view planning approach that utilizes powerful 3D generation capabilities of diffusion models to obtain geometric priors from a single RGB image. The key ideas are:

1) Leverage state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model One-2-3-45++ to generate a 3D mesh given an initial RGB image. This serves as a proxy to unavailable ground truth geometry. 

2) Formulate customized set covering optimization to calculate minimum set of views densely covering the mesh. Incorporate multi-view constraints so each surface point is observed by multiple views, suitable for RGB-based reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs).

3) Solve optimization efficiently using linear programming to obtain adaptive view configuration specifically tailored for the object's geometry.

4) Calculate globally shortest path connecting views for robot to collect images. After data collection, train NeRF using images to reconstruct object.

Main Contributions:

1) First approach to exploit powerful 3D diffusion models for enabling one-shot view planning from only one RGB image

2) Cast one-shot view planning as customized set covering problem for RGB-based reconstruction using NeRFs

3) Achieve adaptive view placement accounting for varying geometries, balancing quality and movement cost

4) Demonstrate applicability and generalization through extensive experiments in simulation and real-world

In summary, this paper makes RGB-based one-shot view planning possible by innovatively utilizing geometric priors from 3D diffusion models, outperforming next-best-view and random view selection baselines. The adaptive optimization formulation leads to object-specific view configurations superior to fixed patterns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an RGB-based one-shot view planning approach for unknown object reconstruction that exploits geometric priors from 3D diffusion models to adaptively compute informative views densely covering surfaces of the generated mesh proxy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel RGB-based one-shot view planning approach that exploits geometric priors from 3D diffusion models. Specifically, the key points are:

(i) The approach enables one-shot view planning starting with only one RGB image as input by utilizing a 3D diffusion model to generate a proxy 3D mesh of the object. 

(ii) The view planning is formulated as a customized set covering optimization problem to adaptively compute a view configuration suitable for RGB-based reconstruction using neural radiance fields.

(iii) Compared to baselines, the approach achieves better trade-offs between reconstruction quality and robot movement costs by placing views based on varying object geometries.

In summary, the core novelty is leveraging powerful 3D diffusion models to provide geometric priors for effective RGB-based one-shot view planning, outperforming other planning methods.
