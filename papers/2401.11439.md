## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "General Flow as Foundation Affordance for Scalable Robot Learning":

Problem:
- Real-world robot manipulation skills are difficult to acquire due to lack of scalable frameworks that can leverage large datasets. Existing methods have limitations in scalability, universality across object categories, and stability for real-world skill transfer.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "General Flow" as a foundation affordance for scalable robot learning. General flow predicts future 3D trajectories of points on objects of interest based on visual observations and language instructions.

- The key idea is that general flow can be predicted from large-scale human video datasets, avoiding the scalability issue of real robot data. It also provides comprehensive geometric and physics guidance for manipulating various object types in downstream tasks.

- A scale-aware model "ScaleFlow" is developed to predict general flow from RGBD videos. Robustness enhancements like scale rebalancing and data augmentations are proposed.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces the concept of general flow as a foundation affordance for scalable, universal robot learning with stable real-world skill transfer.

- Develops method to extract general flow labels from RGBD human videos and train a scale-aware prediction model ScaleFlow. Achieves SOTA performance.

- Real-world experiments on a robot manipulating 18 tasks across rigid, articulated and soft objects. Using just predicted general flow, achieves 81% average success rate in zero-shot human-to-robot skill transfer, demonstrating effectiveness.

- The work provides a promising direction towards scalable acquisition of manipulation skills by robots. Potential to keep improving with more data and model scaling, like in Large Language Models.
