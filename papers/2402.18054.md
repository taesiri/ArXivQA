# [Contextualizing Generated Citation Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18054)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing abstractive citation text generation models often produce generic, vague summaries of the cited paper that do not fit well within the specific citation context. These models are trained as infilling tasks to generate just the citation text itself given the surrounding context and cited paper details. However, they fail to utilize contextual clues about the focus topic and stance to take that are present in the citation context.  

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose contextualized citation text generation, where instead of just generating the citation, the model is trained to generate the entire citation context window with the target citation appropriately filled in. This allows the decoder to take advantage of the full context as a prompt when generating.

Main Contributions:
- Identify issues with coherence and redundancy in standard citation text generation models
- Propose contextualized training to enforce coherence with citation context
- Conduct human evaluation showing contexts help coherence (moderate agreement)
- Present analysis showing contexts provide useful clues about topic, stance, relationships between cited papers etc. that contextualized model can leverage
- Approach is model-agnostic and easy to apply by just changing training procedure

Limitations:
- Limited diversity - focused on NLP papers in English
- Automatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE don't measure coherence well
- Human evals are expensive and don't scale

Ethics Considerations:
- Citation generation risks plagiarism 
- Errors could result in false criticisms that negatively impact perceptions of cited papers


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a contextualized citation text generation approach that trains a model to generate the entire citation context window rather than just the target citation, allowing the model to produce citations more coherent with the surrounding context.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a simple modification to the citation text generation task where instead of just generating the target citation, the model is trained to generate the entire context window containing the citation. This allows the model to make better use of contextual clues when generating the citation text. The authors show through human evaluation and qualitative analysis that citations generated using their proposed "contextualized" approach are more coherent and appropriate to the citing context compared to citations generated using the standard infilling approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Citation text generation - The main task that the paper focuses on, which is generating a short text summarizing how a reference paper relates to the citing context.

- Contextualized citation generation - The proposed approach to improve citation text generation by having the model generate the entire citation context window rather than just the target citation.

- Sequence-to-sequence models - The type of neural network models typically used for citation text generation, which the paper builds upon. 

- Abstractive summarization - Citation text generation is framed as an abstractive summarization task, generating new text rather than extracting.

- Coherence - A key criteria that the proposed approach aims to improve compared to baseline citation generation models.

- Human evaluation - The paper presents human judgment results comparing the proposed contextualized approach against baseline methods.

- Qualitative analysis - In addition to human evaluation, the paper analyzes example outputs to identify specific improvements of the proposed approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "contextualized citation generation" approach. Can you explain in detail how this approach works and how it differs from the standard citation generation approach? 

2. The paper finds that standard citation generation models often produce generic, vague summaries of the reference paper that do not fit the context well. What examples and analysis does the paper provide to demonstrate this problem?

3. The core idea of the proposed approach is to generate the entire context window rather than just the target citation. Walk through the methodology section and explain step-by-step how this idea is implemented. 

4. The human evaluation results show that the proposed approach leads to citations that have better coherence and overall quality. Analyze these results - why do you think contextualization improves coherence specifically?

5. The paper provides several examples illustrating cases where the baseline model ignores contextual clues that the proposed model is able to utilize. Choose two such examples and analyze the differences in detail.  

6. The limitations section mentions that automatic metrics like ROUGE do not adequately measure coherence. Propose some ideas for better automatic evaluation of citation coherence. 

7. The paper analyzes some common scenarios where the baseline citations are problematic, like failing to identify the historical development of a topic. Pick one such scenario and suggest ways the baseline model could be improved to handle it better.

8. The contextualized model seems to more frequently use action verbs like "extend" and "improve" when describing follow-up works. Why do you think this is the case? How does it demonstrate better understanding?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on natural language processing papers in English. Discuss potential challenges in applying this approach to other fields and languages. 

10. The ethics statement raises concerns about plagiarism and unfair criticism. How might these issues be addressed? Could the contextualization approach potentially mitigate or exacerbate them?
