# This Looks Like That: Deep Learning for Interpretable Image Recognition

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop an image recognition model that reasons in an interpretable way that is similar to how humans explain their reasoning process for image classification tasks?In particular, the paper proposes a model called ProtoPNet that classifies images by comparing parts of a new image to learned prototypical parts of images from each class. This allows the model to provide explanations for its predictions in terms of which parts of the input image look similar to which learned prototypes. The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposes the ProtoPNet architecture that has a prototype layer to compare parts of input images to learned prototypes using squared L2 distance. The prototypes are constrained to be identical to latent representations of training image patches to allow visualization.- Introduces a specialized training procedure involving stochastic gradient descent to shape the latent space, projection of prototypes onto latent training patches, and convex optimization of the last layer. - Demonstrates the model on bird species classification and car model identification, showing accuracy comparable to non-interpretable baselines and state-of-the-art models.- Provides interpretability and transparency by visually showing which parts of new images look similar to which learned prototypes for each class as justification for the model's predictions.- Compares ProtoPNet qualitatively to other interpretable models like attention-based networks, arguing it provides finer-grained prototypical case-based reasoning absent in other methods.So in summary, the key research question is how to develop an interpretable image classification model that reasons similarly to humans by comparing parts of new images to learned prototypical parts, which ProtoPNet aims to address through its proposed architecture, training procedure, and qualitative evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing ProtoPNet, a neural network architecture for interpretable image recognition that performs case-based reasoning by comparing parts of a new image to learned prototypical parts. 2. Defining a form of interpretability for image processing ("this looks like that") that agrees with how humans explain classification decisions by pointing out prototypical aspects of different classes.3. Proposing a specialized training procedure for ProtoPNet that involves stochastic gradient descent to shape the latent space, projection of prototypes onto training patches, and convex optimization of the last layer.4. Demonstrating ProtoPNet on fine-grained image classification tasks like bird species identification and car model recognition. Showing that it can achieve accuracy comparable to non-interpretable models, while also providing transparency into its reasoning process.5. Comparing ProtoPNet to other interpretable models like attention-based CNNs, and arguing it provides a deeper level of interpretability by identifying prototypical cases that justify its attention.6. Analyzing the latent space learned by ProtoPNet, showing semantically meaningful clustering and separation of prototypes. And using this to prune ineffective prototypes.In summary, the main novelty seems to be in proposing ProtoPNet as an interpretable deep neural network that classifies images based on similarity to learned prototypical parts, and defining/demonstrating this particular notion of interpretability. The specialized training procedure and comparative evaluations are also significant contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces a deep network architecture called prototypical part network (ProtoPNet) that performs image recognition by comparing parts of a new image to learned prototypical parts of images from each class, providing a level of interpretability and reasoning similar to how humans describe their own thinking in classification tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on interpretable deep learning for image recognition:- The paper proposes a new neural network architecture called ProtoPNet that incorporates prototype learning to enable case-based reasoning. This provides a different form of interpretability compared to other approaches like attention models or post-hoc explanations. - ProtoPNet aims to classify images by comparing parts of the image to learned prototypical parts, analogous to how humans explain image classification tasks. So the interpretability is built directly into the model architecture and reasoning process.- Many previous interpretable models like attention-based CNNs can highlight important parts of images but don't provide prototypical examples for comparison. ProtoPNet associates each prototype with a class and visualizes them as training patches to enable more transparent reasoning.- ProtoPNet requires no additional supervision like part annotations for training, unlike some other interpretable models. The prototypes and attention maps are learned in an end-to-end manner using only image labels.- They propose specialized training techniques like clustering and separation costs to shape the latent space for more semantically meaningful prototypes. This appears to be novel compared to prior prototype learning works.- ProtoPNet achieves high accuracy on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets, comparable or exceeding attention-based models. When ensembled it approaches state-of-the-art levels while offering increased interpretability.- The work builds on some related ideas like distance metric learning and case-based reasoning, adapting them to the deep learning context. The prototypical part comparison seems like a novel form of interpretability for image recognition.In summary, ProtoPNet contributes a new architecture and training approach to inject interpretability into CNNs in a way that provides intuitive explanations analogous to human reasoning. The explanations help increase model transparency without sacrificing accuracy.
