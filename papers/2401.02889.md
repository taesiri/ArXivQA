# [Energy-Preserving Reduced Operator Inference for Efficient Design and   Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02889)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Many engineering systems are modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) which are spatially discretized into high-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). 
- Evaluating these high-dimensional ODE models repeatedly is computationally expensive, limiting their use in design and control applications requiring many model evaluations. 
- Model reduction methods like proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) can reduce the dimensionality. However, POD requires intrusive access to the model equations.
- Non-intrusive methods like Operator Inference (OpInf) learn reduced models from data but don't preserve mathematical structure in the original model that reflects physical principles. 

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes Energy-Preserving Operator Inference (EP-OpInf), a non-intrusive OpInf method which learns quadratic terms with an energy-preserving structure commonly arising from fluid flow models.
- EP-OpInf incorporates an equality constraint into the OpInf optimization problem to enforce the energy-preserving condition on the entries of the quadratic operator.
- This adds structure while still learning the model non-intrusively from data.

Main Contributions:
- Derivation of an equality constraint on quadratic operator entries that enforces the energy-preserving condition. 
- Reformulation of the constraint and OpInf optimization problem for efficient computation.
- Demonstration on the viscous Burgers' equation and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation that EP-OpInf can non-intrusively learn accurate reduced models with energy-preserving quadratic terms.
- This lays the foundation to apply stability analysis tools developed for intrusive reduced models to the non-intrusive EP-OpInf models.

In summary, this paper makes an important contribution in developing structured non-intrusive model reduction by proposing EP-OpInf to learn provably energy-preserving reduced quadratic models solely from data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an energy-preserving operator inference method to non-intrusively learn reduced-order models with quadratic nonlinearities that preserve energy, and demonstrates it on fluid dynamics problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of Energy-Preserving Operator Inference (EP-OpInf), a new reduced model learning method that enforces energy-preserving structure in the learned quadratic operator. Specifically, the paper:

- Proposes constraining the Operator Inference optimization problem to learn a reduced quadratic operator that satisfies an energy-preserving property. This is done by incorporating an equality constraint on the entries of the quadratic operator.

- Demonstrates the EP-OpInf method on two model problems from fluid dynamics - the viscous Burgers' equation and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Shows that EP-OpInf can accurately learn reduced models non-intrusively while enforcing the energy-preserving quadratic structure, akin to intrusive projection-based reduced models.

- Compares the accuracy and constraint satisfaction of the EP-OpInf reduced models to those obtained from standard unconstrained Operator Inference and intrusive POD-Galerkin projection. Finds that EP-OpInf achieves comparable accuracy to the unconstrained OpInf and intrusive approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is the development of a structure-preserving non-intrusive reduced model learning approach that enforces physical energy-preserving structure in the learned quadratic operator. This opens up the possibility of leveraging stability analysis tools developed for intrusive reduced models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Operator Inference (OpInf) - A non-intrusive model reduction method that fits reduced model operators to state snapshot and time derivative data in a least-squares sense

- Energy-preserving quadratic nonlinearity - A property of some quadratic dynamical systems where the quadratic term preserves the energy of the system over time

- Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) - An intrusive model reduction method that projects the governing equations onto a reduced subspace spanned by orthogonal basis vectors 

- Viscous Burgers' equation - A simplified 1D fluid dynamics model used as one of the test problems in the paper

- Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation (KSE) - A model for turbulent dynamics and pattern formation, also used as a test problem

- Energy-Preserving Operator Inference (EP-OpInf) - The proposed method to constrain the OpInf optimization problem to learn a reduced quadratic operator with energy-preserving structure

- Structure-preserving model reduction - Methods to ensure mathematical structures that reflect physical principles are retained in reduced models

- Non-intrusive model reduction - Deriving reduced models purely from input/output data without access to the full model equations or code

In summary, the key focus is on non-intrusively learning reduced order models that preserve physical structure, demonstrated on fluid dynamics test problems with energy-preserving quadratic nonlinearities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the Energy-Preserving Operator Inference (EP-OpInf) method proposed in this paper:

1. The energy-preserving quadratic constraint (Eq. 8) imposes structure on the learned reduced quadratic operator $\hat{\mathbf{H}}$. Does imposing this constraint limit the expressibility or accuracy of the learned reduced model compared to unconstrained Operator Inference? 

2. For problems where stability guarantees enabled by the energy-preserving structure are not needed, would you still recommend using EP-OpInf over standard Operator Inference? What are the tradeoffs?

3. How does the computational cost of solving the constrained optimization problem in EP-OpInf compare to solving the unconstrained least squares problem in standard Operator Inference? How does this affect the feasibility of using EP-OpInf for very high-dimensional problems?

4. The reformulation of the optimization problem using $\hat{\mathbf{F}}$ instead of $\hat{\mathbf{H}}$ was motivated by efficiency considerations. Are there other benefits or downsides to optimizing over $\hat{\mathbf{F}}$ compared to directly optimizing over $\hat{\mathbf{H}}$?

5. Could the idea of constraining Operator Inference generalize to preserving other mathematical structures beyond energy preservation? What types of physical structures would be useful targets for this approach?

6. The numerical experiments focused on 1D problems from fluid dynamics. How do you expect EP-OpInf would perform for higher dimensional fluid systems like the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations?

7. What modifications would be needed to apply EP-OpInf to other classes of nonlinear systems beyond fluids, such as structural dynamics or chemical reaction kinetics?

8. How sensitive is EP-OpInf to the quantity and quality of snapshot data used to train the model? How much data is needed to robustly learn the energy-preserving structure?

9. The error metrics focused on accuracy of state trajectory reconstructions. Did you investigate whether the energy behavior of the learned EP-OpInf models matches that of the full models?

10. One limitation mentioned is that EP-OpInf loses the simplicity and ease-of-implementation of standard Operator Inference. Are there ways to make imposition of structure more turnkey within the Operator Inference framework?
