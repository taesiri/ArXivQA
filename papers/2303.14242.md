# [IDGI: A Framework to Eliminate Explanation Noise from Integrated   Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14242)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to reduce the noise in saliency maps generated by Integrated Gradients (IG) and its variants for interpreting deep neural network predictions. The key hypothesis is that the noise in IG-based saliency maps comes from computing the integral via the Riemann integral along the straight line path, which introduces a "noise direction". The paper proposes a new framework called Important Direction Gradient Integration (IDGI) to eliminate this noise direction during the computation.The main hypothesis is that removing the noise direction and only integrating along the "important direction" will significantly reduce noise and improve the quality of saliency maps generated by IG-based methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called IDGI (Important Direction Gradient Integration) to reduce noise in the saliency maps generated by methods based on Integrated Gradients. Specifically:- The paper analytically examines the source of noise in Integrated Gradient methods and identifies that the noise comes from integrating gradients along "noise directions" that do not actually contribute to explaining the model's predictions. - Based on this analysis, the paper proposes IDGI, which decomposes the original gradient direction into an "important direction" and "noise direction", and only integrates along the important direction to avoid accumulating noise.- IDGI can be incorporated into any existing Integrated Gradient-based method to improve its explanations by reducing noise. - The paper conducts extensive experiments on 11 image classifiers, evaluating with 4 different metrics. Results show IDGI significantly improves attribution quality compared to existing Integrated Gradient methods across all models and metrics.In summary, the main contribution is the theoretical analysis of noise in Integrated Gradient methods, and the proposed IDGI framework to address this issue by avoiding integration along noise directions, leading to improved saliency maps.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a framework called Important Direction Gradient Integration (IDGI) to reduce noise in saliency maps generated by Integrated Gradients and its variants for explaining deep neural network decisions. The key idea is to decompose the gradient direction into an important direction that contributes to function value changes and a noise direction, and only integrate along the important direction to avoid introducing noise.
