# [Transcription and translation of videos using fine-tuned XLSR Wav2Vec2   on custom dataset and mBART](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for low-resource languages like Hindi is challenging due to limited data availability. 
- Personalized ASR models require even more data that captures the unique characteristics of a person's voice.
- Generating enough personalized speech data to train accurate ASR models is very difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Use just 14 minutes of personalized Hindi speech data from a YouTube video 
- Apply retrieval-based voice conversion (RVC) to augment this data and create a custom Common Voice 16.0 dataset capturing the individual voice
- Fine-tune the pre-trained cross-lingual self-supervised XLSR Wav2Vec2 model on this dataset 
- Achieve Hindi speech transcription on personalized voice with the fine-tuned model
- Translate the Hindi output to English using the pre-trained mBART model
- Generate aligned subtitles on videos using speaker diarization and timeline mapping

Key Contributions:
- Novel way to create personalized Hindi speech dataset from limited data using RVC 
- Method to train custom ASR models for low-resource languages tailored to individual voices
- End-to-end pipeline from Hindi speech input to English translated subtitles on video
- Web-based GUI for easy video transcription and translation using the personalized models
- Address the lack of tools for translating Hindi video content with minimal training data

In summary, the paper presents an innovative approach to build personalized Hindi ASR models using limited data and apply it for automated subtitling of videos by integrating speech recognition, translation and speaker diarization modules. The key innovation is in data augmentation and model customization for individual voices in a low-resource setting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method to train a personalized automatic speech recognition model for low-resource Hindi language by creating a custom dataset using only 14 minutes of audio, and integrating speech transcription, translation, and speaker diarization to generate accessible multilingual subtitles for video content.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

Developing a pipeline to train a personalized automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for transcribing and translating Hindi audio to English subtitles, using only 14 minutes of custom audio data. 

Specifically, the key aspects seem to be:

1) Using Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion (RVC) to create a custom Common Voice 16.0 dataset from 14 minutes of personalized audio.

2) Fine-tuning the XLSR Wav2Vec2 model on this small custom dataset to create a personalized ASR model.

3) Integrating speaker diarization, XLSR Wav2Vec2, and mBART translations to generate English subtitles timed to the input Hindi video.

4) Creating an accessible web-based GUI solution to make this pipeline usable for transcribing and translating personalized multilingual video content.

In summary, the main contribution is enabling personalized ASR for low-resource languages by creatively augmenting limited custom data and developing an end-to-end solution tailored for multilingual video content.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- XLSR Wav2Vec2: A self-supervised speech representation learning framework used for speech recognition. The paper fine-tunes an XLSR Wav2Vec2 model on a custom dataset.

- mBART: A multilingual neural machine translation model used in the paper for translating Hindi text to English.

- RVC (Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion): Used to create a synthetic custom dataset with a target voice using limited data. 

- Personalized Speech Conversion: Converting speech to target a specific personalized voice, which is done in the paper using RVC.

- Speaker Diarization: Identifying "who spoke when" within an audio recording. The paper uses pyannote for speaker diarization to segment audio. 

- Low-resource languages: The paper tackles challenges in developing ASR for Hindi, which is considered a low-resource language with limited datasets.

- Data augmentation: Creating a synthetic custom Common Voice dataset using the RVC framework and limited personalized audio data.

So in summary, the key themes are low-resource ASR, personalized speech conversion, multilingual translation, and leveraging self-supervised models like XLSR Wav2Vec2 and mBART.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using just 14 minutes of personalized custom audio to train the RVC model. How does using such a small dataset impact the performance of the RVC model? What strategies could be employed to further improve the model with limited data?

2. The paper talks about making modifications to the utils.py file in the Ozen toolkit to adapt it for Hindi transcription. Can you explain in more detail what changes were made and why? How does this impact the accuracy of the Hindi transcriptions?

3. What were some of the key parameters and settings used when training the RVC model, such as batch size, number of epochs, loss function etc.? How were these parameters tuned and what was their impact on model performance? 

4. The XLSR Wav2Vec2 model seems to be overfitting on the training data based on the results shared. What techniques could be used to reduce overfitting when working with small personalized datasets?

5. Can you explain why the pyannote framework was chosen for speaker diarization? What are some of its key capabilities that make it well-suited for this task? How does it compare to other popular speaker diarization tools?

6. What multilingual capabilities does the mBART model have? Why is it a good fit for translating between Hindi and English? How does the self-supervised pre-training approach used help mBART generalize better?

7. What were some of the major challenges faced while creating the custom Common Voice 16 corpus using just 14 minutes of audio? How can the quality and coverage of the dataset be further improved? 

8. How exactly is the 'output.vtt' file generated using the outputs from speaker diarization, XLSR Wav2Vec2 and mBART? What is the format and contents of this file?

9. The results show the trained XLSR model has 80% training accuracy but a high WER of 0.53. What could be the reasons for this gap? How can WER be reduced further for better ASR performance?

10. The paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing and translating Hindi video to English subtitles. What additional challenges need to be addressed to make this pipeline robust for real-world deployment?
