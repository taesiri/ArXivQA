# NeRF: Neural Radiance Field in 3D Vision, A Comprehensive Review

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question/hypothesis appears to be: How can we develop an end-to-end neural radiance field model that can synthesize novel photorealistic views of scenes by implicitly representing complex scene geometry and appearance?The key ideas proposed to address this question are:- Representing scenes as continuous 5D radiance fields that map 3D coordinates and 2D viewing directions to volume density and emitted color/radiance.- Using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to implicitly model these radiance fields in a fully convolutional manner, without the need for supervision beyond posed 2D images.- Employing volume rendering techniques to synthesize views by integrating color and density along rays.- Enabling view interpolation and novel view synthesis by querying the radiance field MLPs from arbitrary camera positions and angles.- Introducing positional encoding to the inputs of the MLPs to better represent high-frequency scene properties. - Using a hierarchical sampling strategy during volume rendering to focus computations on regions with high frequency detail.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that scene geometry and appearance can be effectively modeled in an all-neural implicit representation to achieve compelling view synthesis from limited posed 2D images, which is demonstrated through the proposed Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a neural radiance field (NeRF) model that is capable of high-quality novel view synthesis from only a sparse set of input views? The key hypothesis is that by incorporating external guidance from 2D image features extracted by pretrained deep convolutional neural networks, a NeRF model can learn to represent complex 3D scenes and synthesize novel views using only a sparse set of input views (e.g. 2-10 views).The paper proposes a novel NeRF architecture called MVSNeRF that incorporates 2D image features from a pretrained CNN to provide guidance and regularization. Specifically:- 2D image features are extracted from the input views using a pretrained CNN backbone (ResNet-18). - These 2D features are lifted into a 3D cost volume using plane sweeping stereo. - A 3D U-Net is used to condense the cost volume into a 3D feature volume.- For each sample point during volume rendering, the 3D feature volume is sampled using trilinear interpolation to extract a latent code. - This latent code provides a strong prior and guides the sample point's density and color prediction by the tiny MLPs.The key hypothesis is that these 2D image features and 3D cost volume can provide powerful regularization that allows the NeRF model to generalize from very sparse input views. Experiments on the DTU dataset confirm this, with MVSNeRF matching NeRF trained from 45 views using only 3-15 input views.In summary, the central research aims to develop a sparse-view capable NeRF through incorporation of 2D image feature guidance, with experiments confirming this approach's ability to synthesize high-quality novel views from only a few input images.
