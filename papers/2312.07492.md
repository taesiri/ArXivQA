# [SocialStigmaQA: A Benchmark to Uncover Stigma Amplification in   Generative Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07492)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called SocialStigmaQA for evaluating unwanted social bias and stigma amplification in generative language models. The benchmark contains 10,360 prompts centered around 93 documented social stigmas and is constructed as a question answering task probing whether models express bias against people with stigmatized conditions in simple social situations. Experiments using two large language models reveal that 45-59% of generated answers exhibit bias, depending on decoding strategy. The study analyzes impacts of factors like prompt style and chain-of-thought triggering, finding that explicitly nudging towards unbiased responses reduces bias, while chain-of-thought can either increase or decrease biased output. Through manual analysis, the authors characterize variability and limitations of chain-of-thought as model explanations. Overall, the paper demonstrates concerning tendencies for current models to amplify harm against people with stigmatized conditions and provides a new rigorous benchmark methodology focused on social biases beyond just protected attributes like race and gender.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces SocialStigmaQA, a new benchmark dataset to measure social bias and stigma amplification in generative language models, containing over 10K prompts about 93 stigmas across 37 templates. Experiments with two language models show high rates of biased output, underscoring risks of deploying generative models without adequate safeguards.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing a large social stigma bias benchmark for question answering, focused on 93 different social stigmas documented in the US. This is the first benchmark of its kind to holistically measure biases against such a comprehensive set of stigmas.

2. Careful attention to prompt engineering, including different styles of prompts (original, positive bias, doubt bias, no-stigma) to nudge the models towards biased or unbiased responses. This allows systematic testing of model robustness. 

3. Analysis of the generated chain-of-thought responses to uncover emerging themes and issues, including subtle bias, lack of reasoning, and mismatches between the chain-of-thought and final answer.

4. Experiments with two large generative language models showing that 45-59% of the questions elicit socially biased responses, depending on the prompting and decoding strategy. The results demonstrate these models' tendency to amplify existing social biases against people with stigmatized conditions.

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of a new benchmark to uncover stigma amplification in language models, with careful prompt engineering and both quantitative analysis and qualitative inspection of model outputs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "prompt styles" to nudge models towards more unbiased responses. Can you expand more on the motivation and thought process behind coming up with the different styles such as "positive bias" and "doubt bias"? How were they formulated and iterated on?

2. Chain-of-thought analysis reveals issues not captured by solely analyzing the final responses. What are some ways this analysis could be expanded or improved to gain further insights? For example, could an automatic classification model be trained?  

3. The paper acknowledges limitations around evaluating open-ended text generation. What approaches or metrics could help improve evaluation of the generated chain-of-thought explanations specifically?

4. The patterns/templates for prompts seem crucial to effectively probing potential biases. What was the process for coming up with and iterating on these patterns? How might new patterns be developed to uncover additional issues?

5. The benchmark results show high variability across models, decoding methods and random seeds. What are some ways this variability could be analyzed further to gain insights? Could certain seeds be more prone to biased outputs?

6. The paper demonstrates reducing bias by adding explicit requests for unbiased responses. How might this concept of modifying prompts be expanded upon? For example, could other techniques like asking the model to justify its responses also help?  

7. The no-stigma control prompts reveal baseline tendencies in model outputs. Should metrics take into account these baseline rates in some way rather than just absolute rates of biased outputs? How might this be approached?

8. The paper acknowledges cultural differences across geographies. How might the benchmark be adapted to account for different cultural contexts and their associated biases and stigmas?

9. The benchmark currently utilizes a discrete choice for answers to enable analysis at scale. Could a hybrid approach with some open-ended answers provide further insights even if difficult to automatically evaluate?

10. The paper mentions reward-based fine-tuning approaches using the labeled dataset. Can you expand on the fine-tuning techniques explored? What results have you seen from fine-tuning so far?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative language models are prone to amplifying social bias against individuals with stigmatized conditions. Most prior work focuses on bias with respect to protected attributes like gender or race rather than stigmas.  
- There is a need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate bias amplification of stigmas in language models.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors introduce SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark consisting of 10,360 question-answering prompts pertaining to 93 different stigmatized conditions documented in literature.  
- The prompts involve simple social situations like hiring someone or allowing children to play together. The questions ask whether to engage with someone with a stigma, to test for biased responses.
- Multiple prompt styles are used including adding positive or uncertain context and a no-stigma control. This tests model tendencies and robustness.

Main Contributions:
- First holistic social stigma bias benchmark for QA with 37 prompt templates covering 93 stigmas
- Analysis of impact of prompt styles in nudging towards more/less biased responses
- Manual analysis revealing model's lack of reasoning in chain-of-thought outputs which can exacerbate bias
- Evaluation using two large language models shows high rate (45-59%) of biased responses on this benchmark

In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate social stigma bias in language models through QA prompts. Analysis of model outputs demonstrates a high tendency for stigma bias amplification. The insights on reasoning issues in chain-of-thought point to problems that could further exacerbate biases.
