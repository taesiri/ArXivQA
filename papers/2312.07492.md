# [SocialStigmaQA: A Benchmark to Uncover Stigma Amplification in   Generative Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07492)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called SocialStigmaQA for evaluating unwanted social bias and stigma amplification in generative language models. The benchmark contains 10,360 prompts centered around 93 documented social stigmas and is constructed as a question answering task probing whether models express bias against people with stigmatized conditions in simple social situations. Experiments using two large language models reveal that 45-59% of generated answers exhibit bias, depending on decoding strategy. The study analyzes impacts of factors like prompt style and chain-of-thought triggering, finding that explicitly nudging towards unbiased responses reduces bias, while chain-of-thought can either increase or decrease biased output. Through manual analysis, the authors characterize variability and limitations of chain-of-thought as model explanations. Overall, the paper demonstrates concerning tendencies for current models to amplify harm against people with stigmatized conditions and provides a new rigorous benchmark methodology focused on social biases beyond just protected attributes like race and gender.
