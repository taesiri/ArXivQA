# [SocialStigmaQA: A Benchmark to Uncover Stigma Amplification in   Generative Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07492)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative language models are prone to amplifying social bias against individuals with stigmatized conditions. Most prior work focuses on bias with respect to protected attributes like gender or race rather than stigmas.  
- There is a need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate bias amplification of stigmas in language models.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors introduce SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark consisting of 10,360 question-answering prompts pertaining to 93 different stigmatized conditions documented in literature.  
- The prompts involve simple social situations like hiring someone or allowing children to play together. The questions ask whether to engage with someone with a stigma, to test for biased responses.
- Multiple prompt styles are used including adding positive or uncertain context and a no-stigma control. This tests model tendencies and robustness.

Main Contributions:
- First holistic social stigma bias benchmark for QA with 37 prompt templates covering 93 stigmas
- Analysis of impact of prompt styles in nudging towards more/less biased responses
- Manual analysis revealing model's lack of reasoning in chain-of-thought outputs which can exacerbate bias
- Evaluation using two large language models shows high rate (45-59%) of biased responses on this benchmark

In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate social stigma bias in language models through QA prompts. Analysis of model outputs demonstrates a high tendency for stigma bias amplification. The insights on reasoning issues in chain-of-thought point to problems that could further exacerbate biases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces SocialStigmaQA, a new question answering benchmark dataset focused on evaluating social bias against 93 stigmas in generative language models, finding that two major models exhibit considerable amplification of bias across various decoding strategies and prompt styles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing a large social stigma bias benchmark for question answering, focused on 93 different stigmas documented in social science literature. This is the first benchmark of its kind to holistically measure biases against such a comprehensive set of stigmas.

2. Careful attention to prompt engineering, including different styles of prompts (original, positive bias, doubt bias, no stigma) to nudge the models towards biased or unbiased responses. This allows them to study the impact of prompt design on model tendencies.

3. Analysis of the generated chain-of-thought (CoT) output through manual annotation, categorizing issues ranging from subtle bias to lack of reasoning abilities. This sheds light into models' reasoning capabilities and potential to exacerbate societal inequities.

In summary, the key novelty is the comprehensive social stigma QA benchmark itself, along with the analysis of how both prompt design and inspection of CoT output provides further understanding of bias and reasoning issues in generative language models.

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called SocialStigmaQA to evaluate bias amplification of stigmas in generative language models, using a QA format over simple social situations. The dataset covers 93 stigmas and uses different prompt styles to test model robustness. Experiments with two language models over 10K prompts show high proportions of biased text. The paper also manually analyzes over 600 chain-of-thought outputs to uncover reasoning issues that exacerbate bias. Overall, it demonstrates the risk of language models in amplifying social biases against people with stigmatized conditions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called SocialStigmaQA to measure social bias against stigmatized groups in generative language models. How was this benchmark dataset constructed in terms of the number of prompts, prompt styles, and coverage of stigmas? What considerations went into the prompt engineering?

2. The benchmark contains 93 different stigmas covering a wide range of health conditions, backgrounds, and personal attributes. What sources or prior work were leveraged to compile this extensive list of stigmas? How does this list compare to the attributes examined in other social bias benchmarks?  

3. The paper examines both the overall proportion of biased responses as well as the impact of different prompt styles. For the prompt styles of "positive bias", "doubt bias", and "no stigma", what was the intention behind including each of these variations and what overall trends were discovered in how they influenced model bias?

4. Both greedy decoding and nucleus sampling were used to generate responses. What differences emerged between these decoding strategies in terms of chain-of-thought quality and proportion of biased responses? How does this shed light on the reliability of chain-of-thought as explanations?

5. The analysis highlights substantial variability in bias across different random seeds during nucleus sampling. What range of bias proportions was observed across seeds and what implications does this have when deploying generative models?

6. The paper manually annotates and categorizes 600 chain-of-thought responses. What were some of the major categories identified during this analysis such as balanced responses, subtle bias, logical but unaligned, etc? What issues did these reveal?

7. For the chain-of-thought analysis, were there noticeable differences found between the two models examined in terms of some categories being more prevalent for one model over the other?

8. The paper acknowledges some limitations around evaluating free-form text generation and the difficulty of automatically analyzing open-ended questions. How were the prompt patterns engineered to facilitate automated evaluation and analysis while still allowing for longer chain-of-thought?  

9. What use cases are discussed for this benchmark and dataset in terms of understanding model bias, enabling interventions to reduce bias, and improving guardrails against harmful output?

10. The paper proposes several promising directions for future work such as covering additional geographies and expanding the scope of attributes. What are some other areas or enhancements you think could be valuable to explore as follow-ons?
