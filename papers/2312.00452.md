# [Towards Generalizable Referring Image Segmentation via Target Prompt and   Visual Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00452)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the generalization ability of referring image segmentation (RIS) models to handle unconstrained text expressions describing unseen visual entities. The method has two main components: 1) Complementing the referring expression with an explicit target prompt consisting of the core target noun in a unified context, which facilitates robust target identification regardless of linguistic variations. This allows capturing language residuals related to the target more effectively. 2) Introducing a multi-modal fusion aggregation module along with guidance from a pretrained vision model to exploit visual spatial relations and coherence, addressing incomplete target masks and false positive clumps commonly occurring when generalizing to new visual domains. Comprehensive experiments under a challenging zero-shot cross-dataset protocol demonstrate consistent and sizable improvements over state-of-the-art RIS techniques. For instance, when trained on RefCOCOg and tested on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and ReferIt, the approach yields average boosts of 4.15%, 5.45% and 4.64% in mean IoU, respectively. The method also generalizes better on a newly collected GraspNet-RIS dataset for robotic manipulation. Thus, the work provides an effective way to enhance generalization of referring expression grounding without additional annotations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes to improve the generalization of referring image segmentation by complementing expressions with target prompts for robust language understanding and introducing multi-modal aggregation with visual guidance to leverage spatial relations and handle incomplete masks or false positives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It introduces a novel task of zero-shot cross-dataset referring image segmentation to assess the generalization of models to various unconstrained expressions and unseen visual entities, including images with domain shifts and unseen categories.

2) It proposes to boost the model's generalization to various text descriptions by supplementing the given expression with an explicit target prompt in a unified context. 

3) It introduces a multi-modal fusion aggregation module along with visual knowledge guidance from a powerful pretrained model to deal with incomplete target masks and false positive clumps that often appear on unseen visual entities.

4) Comprehensive experiments show consistent gains of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving generalization for referring image segmentation.

In summary, the key contribution is a new method that enhances the generalization ability of referring image segmentation models to handle varied free-form expressions and unseen visual data through the use of target prompts and multi-modal fusion with visual guidance.
