# [Successive Prompting for Decomposing Complex Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04092)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we leverage large language models to improve complex question answering with limited supervision, in a way that is modular and provides more opportunities for tailored supervision at each reasoning step?

The key ideas and hypotheses appear to be:

- Prompting methods that generate reasoning steps and answers in one pass discard benefits of modular and symbolic approaches by coupling supervision.

- Successive prompting, which breaks down the complex question into simple QA steps, allows decoupling supervision for question decomposition and answering. 

- Decoupling enables providing tailored examples at each step, and independent training of the decomposition and answering modules.

- Synthetic data generated from semi-structured sources can provide useful intermediate supervision when in-domain decomposition data is limited.

- Successive prompting with synthetic data and limited real examples improves over non-modular prompting methods and modular methods without synthetic data.

So in summary, the main hypothesis seems to be that successive prompting, combined with synthetic data, can improve complex QA with limited supervision by enabling more tailored and modular training. The experiments aim to demonstrate these benefits over alternative prompting and modular methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing the "successive prompting" method for complex question answering. This involves iteratively decomposing a complex question into simple question-answer pairs, and using separate prompts to get the model to decompose the question and answer each simple question. 

2. Showing how successive prompting allows decoupling the supervision and examples for question decomposition from question answering. This enables providing better tailored examples at each step, as well as modular and separate training.

3. Developing a method to synthetically generate complex questions paired with decompositions using semi-structured tables. This provides out-of-domain data to help bootstrap model learning.

4. Demonstrating improved performance over chain-of-thought prompting and state-of-the-art models on a few-shot DROP dataset by combining successive prompting, synthetic data generation, and modules like a symbolic calculator.

In summary, the key ideas are successive prompting to break down complex QA, leveraging synthetic data, and showing improvements in a low-resource setting by decoupling the question decomposition and answering parts of the task.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new model architecture called "Successive Prompting" for complex question answering. This approach breaks down complex questions into simple QA pairs through an iterative process of question decomposition and answering.

- This differentiates it from prior work like Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) which generates reasoning chains for complex QA in a single pass of the language model. Successive prompting allows for more modular and tailored reasoning through its separation of the question decomposition and answering steps.

- The idea of modular reasoning and using specialized modules for certain reasoning tasks connects this work to some prior neural module network papers like Neural Module Networks (Andreas et al., 2016). However, those focused more on visual QA, while this paper tackles complex text QA.

- Using synthetic data to provide intermediate reasoning step supervision is a key contribution. This differs from most prior complex QA datasets which only provide the final answer as supervision. The synthetic data generation process is similar to work by Yoran et al. (2021). 

- Overall, successive prompting seems to be a novel model architecture for iterative complex QA that is enabled by synthetic intermediate supervision. The results demonstrate improved performance over models like Chain-of-Thought that do not separate question decomposition and answering. The modular approach also has advantages over end-to-end neural models.

In summary, this paper introduces a new modular take on prompting-based methods for complex QA that yields better performance and interpretability. The use of synthetic data is also a key contribution for providing intermediate step supervision.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more sophisticated methods for selecting the most relevant examples to provide as context when prompting large language models. The authors note that the in-context examples provided can significantly impact the model's performance, but their method currently just selects the nearest neighbors of the input based on a simple sentence embedding. They suggest exploring more advanced methods for retrieval and selection of optimal examples.

- Exploring different granularities and modularizations when decomposing complex reasoning problems into sub-problems. The authors note that the right level of decomposition depends on the capabilities of the underlying model being used. As models evolve, the appropriate decomposition may need to be revisited. There is also a tradeoff between decomposition and efficiency.

- Applying successive prompting more broadly to other complex reasoning tasks beyond DROP, such as those requiring more commonsense reasoning or causal reasoning. The authors acknowledge their approach currently works well for the types of reasoning in DROP, but may not generalize well to other domains without developing new synthetic data generators.

- Developing better methods for generating synthetic data to provide reasoning chain supervision. The synthetic data developed for DROP may become obsolete as models evolve, so exploring generative methods that can produce varied and diverse reasoning chains will be important for continued progress.

- Investigating how to best integrate neural modules with the prompting framework when those modules consistently outperform the Language Model components. The authors suggest this modularity could allow combining symbolic reasoning engines with neural models.

- Reducing the computational overhead of successive prompting by condensing or combining the prompts. Making many prompt queries currently increases computation requirements substantially compared to a single query.

In summary, the authors point to improvements in example selection, decomposition granularity, synthetic data generation, modular reasoning, and computational efficiency as important directions for future research in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces "Successive Prompting", a method for decomposing complex questions into simple question-answer pairs which are solved sequentially using a language model. This allows for modular training of the question decomposition and question answering steps, and the flexibility to use different in-context examples or other reasoning components tailored to each subtask. The authors demonstrate their approach on a few-shot version of the DROP dataset, where they manually annotate 300 examples with decompositions and generate additional synthetic data from Wikipedia tables. Their method outperforms standard prompting techniques like chain-of-thought as well as symbolic baselines. By decomposing complex reasoning into simpler interpretable steps, Successive Prompting represents a promising direction for improving compositional question answering with limited supervision.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called "Successive Prompting" for answering complex questions that require compositional reasoning. Recent work has used large language models (LMs) to generate intermediate reasoning steps for answering such questions. However, these approaches couple the supervision for question decomposition with supervision for performing the reasoning steps. 

The proposed method of Successive Prompting decouples these two aspects. It breaks down the complex question into simpler questions which are answered iteratively using separate queries to the LM. This provides two benefits: it allows selecting tailored in-context examples for each reasoning step, and it enables training the question decomposition and answering models separately. The method also facilitates injecting synthetic data and using specialized reasoning modules. Experiments on a variant of DROP dataset demonstrate significant gains over models like Chain-of-Thought prompting. A synthetic data generator is proposed to create compositional questions from Wikipedia tables for bootstrapping the model. The best model with Successive Prompting achieves around 5% higher F1 than a state-of-the-art baseline.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called "Successive Prompting" for decomposing complex questions into simple question-answer pairs. The key ideas are:

1) Break down the complex question into simple QA steps, solve each step independently, and repeat until the full question is answered. 

2) Separate the question decomposition and question answering stages. This allows training each stage with tailored examples and even replacing the QA model with specialized modules when beneficial.

3) Use synthetic data generated from semi-structured tables to provide decomposition supervision. This helps bootstrap the model before fine-tuning on limited real examples.

The method is evaluated on a few-shot version of the DROP dataset. The authors manually annotate 300 examples with decompositions and generate a synthetic dataset covering various reasoning types. Their best model, which is a fine-tuned version of Successive Prompting plus a symbolic reasoning module, achieves around 5% better F1 than prior state-of-the-art on a comparable version of DROP. The modular nature of Successive Prompting allows interpreting the model and addressing failures by improving individual components.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on skimming the introduction and conclusions, here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called "Successive Prompting" to iteratively decompose complex questions into simple question-answer pairs, which allows for modular training of the question decomposition and answering steps and also enables using different in-context examples tailored to each step.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper introduction, it seems the paper is addressing the problem of answering complex questions with limited supervision. Specifically:

- Complex question answering datasets like HotpotQA and DROP require reasoning through multiple steps or latent decisions to reach the final answer. 

- Recent work has tried using large language models like GPT-3 in a few-shot setting to solve these tasks. This is done by providing a few training examples in the prompt to the model, showing how to produce reasoning steps and the final answer.

- However, this approach has some limitations:

1) It couples the supervision for question decomposition (producing the reasoning steps) with the supervision for actually performing those steps. 

2) It cannot easily leverage symbolic reasoning components that might be better for certain steps than a large LM.

3) The model only sees one set of training examples based on similarity to the complex question, which may not provide optimal supervision.

- To address these issues, the paper proposes "Successive Prompting", where the complex question is iteratively decomposed into simple questions, answered, and repeated. 

- This decouples the question decomposition and answering steps, allowing for independent supervision, integration of symbolic reasoning, and multiple opportunities to select tailored training examples.

In summary, the paper is addressing the problem of how to effectively perform complex reasoning with limited supervision by proposing a new prompting based approach called Successive Prompting. The key idea is to decompose the complex question into simpler steps that can be prompted and supervised separately.
