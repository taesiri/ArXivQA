# [Authorship Attribution in Bangla Literature (AABL) via Transfer Learning   using ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Authorship attribution in Bangla literature lacks significant work due to the language's complex structure. Existing systems also suffer from:
1) Dependence on manual feature engineering 
2) Lack of resources and benchmark datasets
3) Poor scalability with increasing number of authors, especially with few samples per author
4) Require many samples per author for deep learning models to work well

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using transfer learning with language models to address the limitations. The AWD-LSTM architecture is used as it provides optimizations to generalize well for language modeling. The process has 3 main steps:

1) Pre-train language model on large Bangla corpora like news articles or Wikipedia in an unsupervised manner to learn linguistic patterns
2) Fine-tune the language model on texts from an authorship attribution dataset to adapt to authorial writing styles  
3) Add a classifier on top and train in a supervised manner to predict authors 

Main Contributions:

1) Propose an effective transfer learning framework using language models for authorship attribution in Bangla, which achieves state-of-the-art performance

2) Introduce BAAD16 - the largest Bangla authorship attribution dataset with 16 authors and 13.4 million words 

3) Analyze the effects of different tokenization methods like word, subword and character level

4) Demonstrate the framework's robustness against varying number of authors and fewer samples per author compared to previous models

5) Release multiple pre-trained language models and code to facilitate future Bangla NLP research

The subword tokenized model with news corpus pre-training achieves the best performance of 99.8% accuracy on BAAD16 dataset, outperforming previous models by a large margin.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable transfer learning approach using language modeling with AWD-LSTM architecture for authorship attribution in Bangla literature, which outperforms previous methods and provides pre-trained models for downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposal of a robust and scalable system for Authorship Attribution in Bangla Literature (AABL) using transfer learning with AWD-LSTM architecture. This addresses issues like scarce language resources, scalability, and manual feature engineering.

2. Comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of different tokenization methods (word, subword, character) for the authorship attribution task. The subword tokenized models consistently perform the best.  

3. Creation of a new standard dataset called BAAD16, which is the largest dataset for AABL containing literary works of 16 authors with over 13.4 million words.

4. Release of 6 pre-trained language models on different tokenization types and datasets that can be used for any downstream Bangla NLP task.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective transfer learning framework for authorship attribution in Bangla, analyzes different tokenization methods, provides a large standard dataset, and releases pre-trained models to advance Bangla NLP research. The system is shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods.

The paper proposes using transfer learning with AWD-LSTM language models for authorship attribution in Bangla literature. It analyzes the effects of different tokenization methods (word, subword, character) and compares performance on different datasets. The goal is to develop a scalable and robust system that does not require extensive feature engineering. Key elements include pre-training language models on large Bangla corpora, fine-tuning them on authorship attribution data, and adding a classifier for the final attribution task. The models are evaluated on a new Bangla authorship dataset BAAD16 with 16 authors. Overall, the key focus is on applying transfer learning for authorship attribution in Bangla in an effective and scalable manner.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using transfer learning for authorship attribution in Bangla. Why is transfer learning suitable for this task compared to training a model from scratch? What advantages does it provide?

2. The AWD-LSTM architecture is used as the base model. What are some of the key regularization techniques employed in AWD-LSTM that make it well-suited for language modeling and transfer learning?

3. The model is pre-trained on a Bangla news corpus and Wikipedia dump. What is the effect of using different pre-training datasets? How does perplexity compare between models pre-trained on news vs Wikipedia data?

4. Three types of tokenization are analyzed - word, subword, and character level. What unique information does each encoding level capture in the context of Bangla language? Why does subword tokenization perform the best?

5. The paper demonstrates that the proposed transfer learning approach scales better with increasing number of authors compared to baseline models. What experiments were conducted to evaluate this? How does performance vary across 6, 8, 10 12 and 14 authors?

6. Two datasets were used for evaluation - BAAD6 and the newly introduced imbalanced BAAD16 dataset. What are some key differences between them and how does the model performance compare?

7. The paper mentions gradual unfreezing and discriminative learning rates as techniques for fine-tuning. How do these techniques help prevent catastrophic forgetting of knowledge from pre-training? 

8. How does the model architecture evolve across the three phases - pre-training, fine-tuning and author prediction? Which parts of the model are transferred and which are reinitialized?

9. What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the authorship attribution model? Why must F1 score also be considered besides accuracy for the imbalanced BAAD16 dataset?

10. What directions are identified for future work at the end of the paper? What model architectures and techniques could be explored to further improve performance?
