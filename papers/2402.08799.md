# [Projection-Free Online Convex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers online convex optimization with time-varying constraints. At each timestep, an algorithm must choose a point from a fixed feasible set while approximately satisfying additional soft constraints that change over time.

- Previous algorithms require projecting onto the fixed feasible set, which can be computationally prohibitive in high dimensions. 

- This paper studies projection-free algorithms that use only a linear optimization oracle for the fixed feasible set.

Proposed Solution:
- Two projection-free online algorithms are presented along with regret and constraint violation bounds.

- Algorithm 1 is based on a drift-plus-penalty approach. It provides adaptive regret bounds over any interval but requires optimizing over the soft constraints.

- Algorithm 2 does online primal-dual updates using only first-order information. It has slightly weaker non-adaptive bounds over the full sequence but is more efficient per iteration.

- Algorithm 2 is also extended to a bandit feedback setting with high probability regret and constraint violation bounds.

Main Contributions:
- First projection-free algorithms for online convex optimization with time-varying constraints, relying only on a linear optimization oracle.

- Algorithm 1 achieves strong adaptive bounds, while Algorithm 2 has standard bounds but is more practical. 

- Regret bounds scale as ~T^{3/4} and constraint violation as ~T^{7/8} with only T calls to the oracle.

- Algorithm 2 is further adapted to bandit feedback while preserving the bounds up to problem-dependent factors.

In summary, the paper proposes efficient projection-free algorithms for online learning with changing constraints, providing the first results for this setting along with sound theoretical guarantees. The techniques help enable online learning in complex domains with runtime constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents projection-free online algorithms with regret and constraint violation guarantees for online convex optimization problems with time-varying constraints, using only linear optimization oracles rather than projections.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose projection-free online convex optimization algorithms for the setting of time-varying constraints. Specifically, they consider a fixed "hard" constraint set that actions must always satisfy, along with additional "soft" time-varying constraints. Their algorithms only require access to a linear optimization oracle over the hard constraint set rather than needing projections.

2) They provide an algorithm based on drift-plus-penalty ideas that achieves an adaptive regret bound of Ã•(T^{3/4}) and constraint violation of O(T^{7/8}) over any interval. This is a stronger notion than standard regret over the entire sequence. 

3) They provide a more efficient primal-dual algorithm that achieves similar regret and constraint violation bounds but over the entire sequence rather than adaptively. This algorithm only requires first-order information.

4) They extend the primal-dual method to a bandit feedback setting and provide regret and constraint violation bounds in expectation that depend on T in the same way, up to dependencies on the dimension.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing projection-free methods for online convex optimization with time-varying constraints, and providing algorithms with sublinear regret and constraint violation guarantees, including an adaptively robust algorithm. The extension to bandit feedback is also a notable contribution.

The paper considers the problem of online convex optimization with time-varying constraints, where actions chosen by the algorithm must satisfy a fixed "hard" constraint set as well as time-varying "soft" constraints revealed over time. The key focus is on developing projection-free algorithms that access the fixed constraint set only through a linear optimization oracle, rather than requiring projections. The paper provides algorithms with regret and constraint violation bounds, including adaptive regret bounds over intervals. Key techniques used include drift-plus-penalty, primal-dual methods, and extensions to the bandit setting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an algorithm for online convex optimization with time-varying constraints that is projection-free and instead relies only on a linear optimization oracle. What are the key challenges in developing a projection-free algorithm in this setting compared to one that uses projections?

2. The drift-plus-penalty style algorithm in Section 3 achieves adaptive regret bounds. What is the significance of having adaptive regret guarantees in the context of time-varying constraints? How does this differ from standard non-adaptive regret?

3. The algorithm in Section 4 is more efficient but loses the adaptive regret guarantees. What is the tradeoff being made here between computational efficiency and strength of theoretical guarantees? 

4. Both algorithms access the hard constraint set K only through a linear optimization oracle. What are some examples of complex sets K where projection is difficult but linear optimization can be done efficiently?

5. The bandit feedback algorithm in Section 5 requires additional smoothness assumptions on the loss and constraint functions. Why are these assumptions needed and how do they enable the use of gradient estimates?

6. How do the regret and constraint violation bounds of the algorithms scale with the time horizon T? What is the significance of the exponent in the T dependence?

7. The algorithms have a batch size parameter K that impacts performance. How should the choice of K balance competing needs? What is the impact on regret, constraint violation and computational efficiency?

8. What modifications would be needed to handle the case when the feasible set K is time-varying instead of fixed? What new challenges arise?

9. Could the algorithms be applied or adapted if instead of a linear optimization oracle, one had access to an epsilon-approximate linear optimization oracle? 

10. The paper assumes bounded subgradient norms for analysis. How could the algorithms and theory be extended to handle unbounded subgradient domains?
