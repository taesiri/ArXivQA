# [Projection-Free Online Convex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers online convex optimization with time-varying constraints. At each timestep, an algorithm must choose a point from a fixed feasible set while approximately satisfying additional soft constraints that change over time.

- Previous algorithms require projecting onto the fixed feasible set, which can be computationally prohibitive in high dimensions. 

- This paper studies projection-free algorithms that use only a linear optimization oracle for the fixed feasible set.

Proposed Solution:
- Two projection-free online algorithms are presented along with regret and constraint violation bounds.

- Algorithm 1 is based on a drift-plus-penalty approach. It provides adaptive regret bounds over any interval but requires optimizing over the soft constraints.

- Algorithm 2 does online primal-dual updates using only first-order information. It has slightly weaker non-adaptive bounds over the full sequence but is more efficient per iteration.

- Algorithm 2 is also extended to a bandit feedback setting with high probability regret and constraint violation bounds.

Main Contributions:
- First projection-free algorithms for online convex optimization with time-varying constraints, relying only on a linear optimization oracle.

- Algorithm 1 achieves strong adaptive bounds, while Algorithm 2 has standard bounds but is more practical. 

- Regret bounds scale as ~T^{3/4} and constraint violation as ~T^{7/8} with only T calls to the oracle.

- Algorithm 2 is further adapted to bandit feedback while preserving the bounds up to problem-dependent factors.

In summary, the paper proposes efficient projection-free algorithms for online learning with changing constraints, providing the first results for this setting along with sound theoretical guarantees. The techniques help enable online learning in complex domains with runtime constraints.
