# [An alternating peak-optimization method for optimal trajectory   generation of quadrotor drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02944)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel time-optimal trajectory generation method for quadrotor drones under the framework of continuous-time polynomial trajectories. The key innovation is an alternating peak-optimization approach which splits the optimization problem into two steps: optimizing polynomial coefficients for smoothness with fixed segment times, and then optimizing segment times while fixing polynomials. Specifically, the new formulation focuses on minimizing total trajectory time subject to constraints on motion derivatives to ensure feasibility. The peak-optimization method adjusts segment times to push motion derivatives to their limits in each part of the trajectory. Comparative simulations and experiments using a Crazyflie drone demonstrate superior performance to prior methods, with the peak-optimization technique achieving significantly faster total trajectory times. With appropriate tuning of motion derivative limits, the method can both generate aggressive time-optimal trajectories and trajectories with guaranteed feasibility. Overall, this is an important advancement in aggressive drone maneuvering with assurances on smoothness and feasibility.
