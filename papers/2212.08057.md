## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors of the paper suggest a few potential future research directions:1. Reducing the training costs for distillation-based methods like R2L and this work. The paper notes that R2L uses 10K pseudo images generated by the teacher NeRF model to train the student model, which is much more than the ~100 images used to train the original NeRF model. Finding ways to reduce the amount of data needed for the student model training would help improve training efficiency.2. Improving the network architecture and training pipeline to boost the performance of the current model. The paper mentions a limitation that their model struggles to generate some high-frequency image details. Using larger models may help but would increase latency on mobile devices. So optimizing the network design could alleviate this issue. 3. Exploring other application scenarios beyond virtual try-on. The paper demonstrates a shoes virtual try-on application to showcase the real-time rendering capability on mobile devices. The authors suggest there is potential to build more real-world applications like augmented reality by leveraging fast neural rendering models.4. Training the student model on mixed data from different scenes/datasets. The current training pipeline renders pseudo data separately for each scene. Jointly training across multiple scenes could improve generalizability. 5. Reducing the model size further for edge devices. The paper obtains a compact 8.3MB model. Further model compression techniques like quantization or pruning could potentially reduce the size even more for very resource constrained devices.In summary, the main future directions are centered around improving training efficiency, boosting image quality, and expanding the applicability of real-time neural rendering on mobile platforms. Reducing model size and training data requirements would also help with deployment. Exploring additional applications beyond virtual try-on is suggested.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes MobileR2L, a real-time neural rendering model for mobile devices. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate high quality novel views of a scene, but have prohibitively slow rendering speed due to volumetric rendering. Neural Light Fields (NeLF) map a ray directly to RGB color with a single network forward, enabling much faster rendering. However, previous NeLF methods are still too slow for real-time mobile use. The key ideas of MobileR2L are: 1) Using a convolutional network backbone rather than MLP, which runs efficiently on mobile hardware. 2) Rendering a low resolution light field volume, then upsampling with super resolution modules to obtain high resolution images. This avoids needing to store many ray samples in memory. Experiments show MobileR2L renders high quality images in real-time on mobile phones (18ms per frame), with 15-24x less storage than MobileNeRF and better image quality. This enables interactive neural rendering applications like virtual try-on.
