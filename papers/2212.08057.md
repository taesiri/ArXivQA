Most prior work on accelerating neural rendering requires high-end GPUs, which makes deployment on mobiles difficult. - The approach builds on recent work on neural light fields (NeLF) like R2L, which avoid the slow volumetric sampling of NeRF. The key novelty is designing a convolutional network architecture optimized for mobile inference. - Compared to the recent MobileNeRF which also targets mobiles, this method achieves better image quality while requiring 15-24x less storage by avoiding mesh representations. It runs faster on real-world scenes.- The proposed model distills a teacher NeRF model into a student NeLF network, similar to R2L.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on efficient neural rendering:- Most prior work on accelerating neural rendering like NeRF focuses on GPU optimization or precomputation, which still requires high-end GPUs. This paper specifically targets real-time rendering on mobile devices, which is a novel contribution. - This paper follows a similar idea to R2L by representing the scene as a neural light field rather than a neural radiance field. However, R2L uses a complex MLP network which is too slow for real-time mobile use. This paper proposes a more efficient convolutional network architecture.- Compared to MobileNeRF which also runs on mobile, this method achieves better rendering quality while using 15-24x less storage by avoiding mesh representations. MobileNeRF has issues scaling to complex scenes unlike this method.- Most neural rendering papers focus on synthetic data. A key contribution here is showing real-time performance on real captured datasets, not just synthetic ones.- The idea of distilling a radiance field into a light field model follows RSEN and R2L. The novelty is in the specific convolutional architecture design for efficient mobile usage.- For real applications, they demonstrate virtual try-on as an example use case enabled by the real-time performance on mobile devices. Most neural rendering papers don't discuss applications.In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of neural rendering by proposing a model tailored for real-time rendering on mobile devices, which enables new applications. The comparisons show advantages over prior work on mobile rendering and real-world scenes. The novel architecture design is key to the improved efficiency.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors of the paper suggest a few potential future research directions:1. Reducing the training costs for distillation-based methods like R2L and this work. The paper notes that R2L uses 10K pseudo images generated by the teacher NeRF model to train the student model, which is much more than the ~100 images used to train the original NeRF model. Finding ways to reduce the amount of data needed for the student model training would help improve training efficiency.2. Improving the network architecture and training pipeline to boost the performance of the current model. The paper mentions a limitation that their model struggles to generate some high-frequency image details. Using larger models may help but would increase latency on mobile devices. So optimizing the network design could alleviate this issue. 3. Exploring other application scenarios beyond virtual try-on. The paper demonstrates a shoes virtual try-on application to showcase the real-time rendering capability on mobile devices. The authors suggest there is potential to build more real-world applications like augmented reality by leveraging fast neural rendering models.4. Training the student model on mixed data from different scenes/datasets. The current training pipeline renders pseudo data separately for each scene. Jointly training across multiple scenes could improve generalizability. 5. Reducing the model size further for edge devices. The paper obtains a compact 8.3MB model. Further model compression techniques like quantization or pruning could potentially reduce the size even more for very resource constrained devices.In summary, the main future directions are centered around improving training efficiency, boosting image quality, and expanding the applicability of real-time neural rendering on mobile platforms. Reducing model size and training data requirements would also help with deployment. Exploring additional applications beyond virtual try-on is suggested.
