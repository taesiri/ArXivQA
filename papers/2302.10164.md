# [Seasoning Model Soups for Robustness to Adversarial and Natural   Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10164)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we create image classifiers that are robust to diverse adversarial perturbations and natural distribution shifts by combining multiple models with different types of robustness?

The key ideas and hypotheses explored in this paper are:

- Adversarial training produces models robust to a specific threat model (e.g. L-infinity bounded perturbations), but they remain vulnerable to other unseen attacks. 

- Interpolating the parameters of models specialized to different threat models (L-infinity, L2, L1 norms) can allow smoothly trading off robustness between them.

- Such interpolated "model soups" can potentially achieve robustness to multiple perturbation types without explicitly training on all of them jointly.

- Model soups with diverse robustness properties could help adapt classifiers to perform well under natural distribution shifts with few examples. 

- Combining nominal, adversarially robust, and differently fine-tuned models in a soup provides flexibility to balance accuracy on the original data and robustness to shifts.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that creating model soups by merging classifiers with complementary robustness can yield improved robustness to diverse adversarial and natural distribution shifts compared to individual specialized models. The paper explores this via interpolating models robust to different Lp norms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Showing how to create adversarial robust "model soups" (i.e. linear combinations of model parameters) that can smoothly trade off robustness to different l_p-norm bounded adversaries without needing to train on all of them simultaneously.  

2. Demonstrating that these model soups can be used to quickly adapt classifiers to new unseen distribution shifts (like ImageNet variants) using just a few examples, by tuning the soup weighting.

3. Analysis showing which types of classifiers (e.g. nominally trained vs l_infty trained) are most useful for performance on different ImageNet variant datasets.

4. Finding that extrapolation outside the convex hull of the model parameters can sometimes yield even better robustness on individual threat models compared to the specialized models.

5. Showing a single soup can be found that works reasonably well across multiple ImageNet variants, outperforming adversarial training and self-supervised baselines.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be a new method for creating model soups from adversarially robust classifiers that enables flexible trade-offs between robustness types and rapid adaptation to new distributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes creating model soups, which are linear combinations of parameters from classifiers robust to different adversarial attacks, as a flexible way to control and balance robustness across multiple threat models without retraining, and to adapt quickly to new unseen distribution shifts with only a few examples.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of adversarial robustness and distribution shifts:

- The idea of using model soups/ensembles to improve robustness is not entirely new, as the authors mention related works like snapshot ensembling and model soups for clean accuracy. However, applying this approach specifically to models trained with different adversarial perturbations is novel. 

- Most prior work on adversarial robustness to multiple perturbations has focused on training one model to be robust to all of them simultaneously. This requires access to all threat models during training. In contrast, the soups approach allows adapting to new perturbations after training without retraining.

- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on robustness to multiple perturbations without joint training. The flexibility of model soups also provides good performance on unseen natural distribution shifts.

- Using model soups for few-shot adaptation to new datasets is an interesting application that I haven't seen explored much before. The authors demonstrate it requires very few samples to find an effective soup.

- Analyzing the composition of successful soups to gain insight about which models are most relevant for different distribution shifts is a nice contribution. This helps interpret what the soups are learning.

- Compared to some other recent work on improving robustness to natural distribution shifts, this approach does not require any specialized training schemes like the dual-network structure in AdvProp. The core idea of soups is fairly simple.

Overall, I think this is a solid incremental contribution over prior art on using ensembles for robustness. The applications to multiple perturbations and adapting to dataset shifts are novel and practically useful. The simplicity of the approach is also a plus. The experimental results validate it can work well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring the use of model soups for other types of distribution shifts beyond the ImageNet variants studied in the paper. The flexibility of soups could be useful for many other dataset shifts.

- Developing automated or algorithmic methods for optimizing the soup weights, rather than just grid search. This could allow finding better soups from fewer examples.

- Applying model soups to other adaptation settings like unsupervised domain adaptation or test-time adaptation. The soups provide a good starting point with their diversity of models.

- Expanding the diversity of models included in the soups beyond just nominal and adversarial training. Bringing in other specialized models could further improve the adaptation abilities.

- Studying if and how extrapolation beyond the convex hull of model parameters could be effectively utilized. The paper shows extrapolation helped for some individual threat models.

- Validating the usefulness of soups for robustness to real-world shifts beyond the simulated ones in the paper. Testing on natural distribution shifts in the wild would be an important next step.

- Developing theoretical understanding of when and why model soups enable effective adaptation and robustness generalization.

In summary, the authors propose exploring more applications of soups, automating soup optimization, expanding the diversity of models in the soups, validating on new domains, and further theoretical analysis as interesting future directions following this work.
