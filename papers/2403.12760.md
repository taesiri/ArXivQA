# [WaveFace: Authentic Face Restoration with Efficient Frequency Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing diffusion model (DM) based blind face restoration (BFR) methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) Slow training and inference due to large image sizes, and (2) Failure to preserve identity and recover fine details due to the unconditional restoration scheme. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes WaveFace, a frequency-aware BFR method that operates in the wavelet domain to achieve efficient and authentic restoration. The key ideas are:

(1) Perform restoration in frequency domain using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). This allows operating on downsampled low-frequency components to improve efficiency.

(2) Propose a Low-frequency Conditional Denoising (LCD) module based on conditional DM to restore downsampled low-frequency component. Conditioning on low-quality (LQ) input preserves identity.

(3) Design a High-Frequency Recovery (HFR) module to recover high-frequency components at multiple DWT scales using a U-Net. This recovers fine details.

(4) Reconstruct final image using Inverse DWT on restored low and high freq. components.


Main Contributions:

(1) First frequency-aware diffusion model for blind face restoration that operates on downsampled components. Achieves 10x speedup over pixel-domain methods.

(2) Novel LCD module with conditional DM that uses LQ input for conditioning at each denoising step to preserve identity.

(3) HFR module to recover high-freq. details at multiple scales in one pass for efficiency.

(4) State-of-the-art results on benchmarks. Outperforms existing methods in efficiency, identity preservation and detail recovery.

The core idea is to break up the problem into efficient frequency domain processing while using conditioning and detail recovery modules to maintain authenticity. The method achieves an elegant balance between restoration quality and efficiency.
