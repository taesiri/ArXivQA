## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Overview:
This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in local feature matching for images, with a focus on deep learning-based methods. Local feature matching establishes correspondences between similar image features across different images and serves as a core component for many computer vision tasks. 

Problem:
Local feature matching faces significant challenges due to factors like changes in viewpoint, scale, illumination, and textures. Conventional handcrafted methods rely on engineered feature detectors and descriptors, struggling to handle these variations.   

Solutions:  
The paper categorizes recent methods into Detector-based models and Detector-free models.

Detector-based models detect sparse key points and extract descriptors before matching. These include Detect-then-Describe, Joint Detection & Description, Describe-then-Detect, and Graph Based methods. 

Detector-free models directly establish dense correspondences without separate detection and description stages. These encompass CNN Based, Transformer Based, and Patch Based approaches.

The paper also discusses applications of feature matching in Structure from Motion, Remote Sensing, and Medical Image Registration.

Main Contributions:

- Comprehensive overview of deep learning advances in local feature matching since 2018, outlining two major model categories   

- Analysis of datasets, evaluation metrics, and quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art techniques
 
- Exploration of practical applications of feature matching across diverse domains

- Identification of current challenges and future research directions in local feature matching

The paper serves as an extensive reference for researchers by assessing existing methods, applications, benchmarks and laying out opportunities for advancing this crucial field.
