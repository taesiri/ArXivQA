# [Previously on the Stories: Recap Snippet Identification for Story   Reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07271)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In long story books or TV show episodes, there can be a significant temporal gap between the current scene and previous important plots that provide context. Readers may also forget initially unimportant details that later become relevant. 
- Providing a recap of the tightly related previous events can help readers recall important details and understand the ongoing storyline. However, automatically identifying such "recap snippets" from previous context has not been well studied.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new task called Recap Snippet Identification, which involves identifying previous snippets from a story that are temporally correlated and causally related to a given "target" snippet.
- They create a new dataset called RECINDENT across 3 books and 2 TV shows with human annotations of recap snippets for sampled target snippets.
- Baseline methods using similarity matching, LLMs and an unsupervised auxiliary training approach are proposed. A pipeline system using candidate filtering and LLMs is also introduced.

Key Contributions:
- First benchmark and dataset for the novel and useful task of Recap Snippet Identification requiring understanding of plot correlations.
- Analysis showing the task is challenging for current PLMs, LLMs and proposed methods.
- Proposed dataset with rich annotations to stimulate further research into textual narrative understanding.
- Exploration of zero-shot LLM capabilities and supervised/unsupervised training approaches for this application.

In summary, this paper pioneers the formal study of identifying recap snippets to assist with story understanding and reading. Both the dataset and analysis of models provide a foundation to make progress on this useful application at the intersection of NLP and narrative comprehension.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new task called Recap Snippet Identification for identifying important previous parts of a story that help understand the current part, presents a dataset to evaluate this task, and experiments with various methods including pre-trained language models to establish baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new task called Recap Snippet Identification. Specifically:

- They define the task of identifying "recap snippets" - snippets from the previous context that contain events directly temporally or causally related to the current snippet. This is similar to a "previously on" recap in TV shows.

- They present a new dataset called RECIDENT to support evaluation of this task. It contains annotated snippet pairs from books and TV show synopses, labeled whether the previous snippet recap is related to the current one.

- They propose several baseline methods for the task, including using pre-trained language models (LLMs like LLaMA and ChatGPT) in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, as well as an unsupervised auxiliary training method using reader notes.

- Through experiments, they demonstrate that the task is challenging for current PLMs and LLMs to understand the plot correlations between snippets, despite their strong language capabilities.

In summary, the key contribution is formally defining and providing a dataset for the new task of Recap Snippet Identification, along with analysis of baseline models that indicates more work is needed to address reasoning about temporal/causal relationships in narratives.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Recap snippet identification - The main task proposed in the paper, which involves identifying relevant "recap" snippets from previous context that can help a reader recall important plot details to understand the current part of a story.

- Temporal and causal correlations - The recap snippets are defined to have direct temporal and causal correlations to the target snippet, revolving around the same event or leading directly to the events in the target snippet.

- Plot relationships between snippets - A core focus of the paper is understanding the plot-level relationships and connectivity between short story excerpts/snippets.

- Long-text noise - The paper examines the challenge of overcoming irrelevant "noise" snippets in long textual context to identify the pertinent recap snippets.  

- Reader notes - The paper explores using reader notes as a bridge to help models learn associations between related story snippets that readers commented on.

- Line2Note training - An unsupervised training method proposed that uses reader notes to connect related snippets.

- Evaluation dataset - The paper introduces a new dataset called RECINDENT for evaluating recap snippet identification.

In summary, the key themes have to do with understanding temporally and causally connected plot relationships between short story snippets, and leveraging additional signals like reader notes to help models identify meaningful recap snippets from long context.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an unsupervised training method called Line2Note training. Can you explain in detail how this method works and what objective it optimizes for? What is the intuition behind using reader notes to bridge the association between story snippets?

2. The paper adapts several neural network models like RoBERTa and SBERT for the task of recap snippet identification. Can you analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using these models? Why does SBERT seem to get worse with supervised fine-tuning while RoBERTa improves?

3. The paper studies the capability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, LLaMA, and InternLM for this task. Can you discuss the challenges faced in using LLMs and why their performance is not as good as expected? What are some ideas to improve LLM performance?  

4. One of the findings is that adding character name filtering (Char-Filter) helps improve the performance of certain methods like ChatGPT. Why do you think character information is useful as a filter? When does it not help or even hurt performance?

5. The paper proposes a pipeline system involving Line2Note training and ChatGPT to balance performance and efficiency. Can you explain why this pipeline works well? What are its limitations? Can you suggest improvements to this pipeline?

6. One key aspect studied is the effect of distance between the target and candidate snippets. Why does the performance tend to drop with increasing distance? Does this fully align with human performance and intuition? How can methods be improved to handle long-range dependencies?  

7. The TV production data uses event information to automatically construct training pairs. Analyze the pros and cons of this method. Why does removing event names in the target snippet lower performance significantly?

8. The paper finds supervised fine-tuning doesn't help most models, while unsupervised Line2Note training does. What explanations can you provide for this? When will supervised data be useful here?

9. Can you think of other unsupervised pre-training objectives that could help bridge the association between snippets for this task, apart from using reader notes?

10. How suitable do you think the evaluation protocol and metrics used in the paper are for this task? Can you suggest any improvements or alternatives for evaluation?
