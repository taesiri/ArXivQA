# [Face Completion with Semantic Knowledge and Collaborative Adversarial   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03252)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve face completion using generative adversarial networks (GANs) by incorporating semantic knowledge and collaborative learning of multiple related tasks. 

Specifically, the authors propose a collaborative GAN framework to facilitate joint training of face completion along with semantic segmentation and landmark detection. Their key hypothesis is that training these related tasks together will allow for better knowledge sharing and lead to improved performance on all tasks compared to training them individually. The semantic information from segmentation and landmarks acts as an inductive bias to help the model better understand facial structure and geometry. This in turn improves the realism and coherence of the face completions produced by the model.

The main research questions/hypotheses addressed are:

- Can a collaborative GAN framework with joint training of related tasks improve face completion results over single-task models?

- Does incorporating semantic knowledge from segmentation and landmarks guide the model to generate more structurally consistent and realistic face completions? 

- Can face completion help improve performance on segmentation and landmark detection through multi-task knowledge sharing?

- Does an inpainting-concentrated scheme focused on reconstructing only the masked regions lead to better results than auto-encoding the full image?

The experiments aim to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed collaborative adversarial learning approach in generating more semantically coherent and realistic face completions. The key hypothesis is that leveraging semantic guidance from related tasks within a joint GAN framework improves results over single-task learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel collaborative generative adversarial network (GAN) framework called collaborative GAN (collaGAN) for face completion. The key ideas include:

- Formulating a collaGAN model to collaboratively learn multiple related tasks (face completion, landmark detection, semantic segmentation) to help the main task of face completion by incorporating additional semantic knowledge. 

- Proposing an inpainting concentrated scheme to focus the model on inpainting the missing region rather than autoencoding the whole image.

- Introducing skip connections in the generator network for better coherence between inpainted region and context.

- Using separate conditional discriminators for each task for better quality control.

- Demonstrating that through collaborative training, the multiple tasks help each other by sharing knowledge, leading to better performance on all tasks compared to single-task training.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a collaborative GAN approach to face completion that incorporates semantic knowledge from related tasks during joint training to achieve more realistic inpainting results. The proposed techniques help the model learn better representations and understand facial structure.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a collaborative generative adversarial network framework for face completion that leverages semantic knowledge from related tasks like segmentation and landmark detection to produce more realistic inpainting results.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in the field of face completion with generative adversarial networks (GANs):

- The paper proposes a novel "collaborative GAN" (collaGAN) framework that trains the face completion task jointly with other related tasks like facial landmark detection and semantic segmentation. This collaborative approach allows the model to learn better features and semantic understanding compared to training on the completion task alone. Other papers have explored multi-task learning but not in this collaborative GAN framework.

- The paper uses an "inpainting concentrated" scheme to focus the model on filling in the missing regions rather than reconstructing the whole image. This is a novel technique compared to prior work like context encoders that reconstruct the entire image.

- The model incorporates skip connections between encoder and decoder, which helps maintain coherence between inpainted region and context. Skip connections have been used in other domains before like medical imaging, but not for face completion.

- The paper demonstrates superior quantitative and qualitative results compared to prior state-of-the-art methods like context encoders, semantic inpainting with adversarial learning, and generative face completion. The collaborative framework consistently produces more realistic and structurally coherent completions.

- The inpainting focused training also enables the model to handle random noise masks, unlike some prior methods that require rectangular mask regions. This improves the flexibility and robustness.

In summary, the key novelties are the collaborative GAN framework, inpainting concentrated scheme, and experimental results showing these improve coherence, realism and flexibility compared to previous face completion techniques. The collaborative approach is a unique way to incorporate semantic knowledge into the GAN training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the collaborative GAN framework to other image completion tasks beyond faces, such as scene completion. The authors suggest their method could generalize to other objects/scenes.

- Exploring the use of other related tasks beyond segmentation and landmark detection that could provide useful semantic knowledge to aid image completion. The authors propose their collaborative learning framework is flexible to incorporating additional tasks.

- Applying the proposed approach to higher resolution images. The experiments in the paper use 128x128 images, but the authors suggest the method could scale to larger images.

- Investigating conditional GANs to guide face completion based on attributes or other facial priors. The collaborative learning provides some guidance, but more explicit conditioning could further improve results.

- Adding recurrent connections to model temporal consistency for video completion. The current model operates on single images.

- Exploring alternative loss functions and network architectures tailored for completion. The authors use standard GAN losses and CNN architectures in this work.

- Extending the approach to 3D completion tasks, as image completion methods have been used for some 3D tasks like metal artifact reduction in CT scans.

Overall, the main future direction highlighted is extending collaborative adversarial learning to new tasks, image types, network designs, and conditional settings to demonstrate the general applicability of the framework.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method proposed in this paper is a collaborative generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for face completion. The key ideas are:

1) Formulating a collaborative GAN (collaGAN) to facilitate the joint learning of multiple related tasks including face completion (inpainting), landmark detection, and semantic segmentation. The generator outputs multiple channels for each task while sharing most parameters. The discriminators are task-specific for better quality control. 

2) Introducing an inpainting concentrated scheme so the model focuses more on inpainting the missing region rather than reconstructing the context. The discriminator judges realism based only on the inpainted region. The reconstruction loss is computed only within the missing region.

3) Adding skip connections between the encoder and decoder in the generator to shuttle low-level features and improve coherence between context and inpainted content. 

4) Demonstrating that through collaborative training of multiple tasks, the model gains better semantic understanding of faces, leading to more realistic face completion results. The shared knowledge also boosts segmentation and detection performance. Comparisons show the method outperforms existing inpainting methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of face completion (i.e. inpainting missing regions of faces) in a semantically realistic way. In particular, it focuses on incorporating semantic knowledge about faces into the face completion process to improve results. 

The key questions addressed are:

- How can semantic knowledge about faces (e.g. landmarks, segmentation) be incorporated into generative adversarial networks (GANs) for face completion to improve results?

- How can multiple related tasks like face completion, landmark detection, and semantic segmentation be trained jointly in a collaborative manner to share knowledge and improve overall performance?

- How can the model focus more on inpainting the missing regions rather than just auto-encoding the unoccluded context?

The authors propose a collaborative GAN framework to address these questions and incorporate semantic knowledge through joint training of multiple related tasks. The model outputs completion, landmarks, and segmentation together. They also introduce an inpainting concentrated scheme to focus learning on the missing regions.
