# [BFRFormer: Transformer-based generator for Real-World Blind Face   Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18811)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Blind face restoration aims to recover high-quality face images from low-quality counterparts with unknown degradation. Existing methods tend to generate over-smoothed results and lose identity-preserved facial details when the degradation is severe. This is attributed to the limited receptive field and short-range dependencies of convolutional neural networks. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes BFRFormer, a Transformer-based blind face restoration framework to address the above issues. The key aspects are:

(1) BFRFormer follows an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder extracts multi-resolution features from the input image. The decoder contains multiple Transformer blocks that model long-range dependencies to generate more facial details. 

(2) An aggregated attention module (AAM) is proposed, combining channel attention to extract global information and double attention for local dependencies. This activates more effective pixels from the input for restoration.

(3) A wavelet discriminator is used to suppress blocking artifacts. Spectral normalization and balanced consistency regularization are applied to address training instability and overfitting.  

(4) Additional losses are used including perceptual loss, facial region-of-interest (ROI) discriminative loss, and data augmentation to further improve image quality.

Main Contributions:

(1) Proposes BFRFormer, the first Transformer-based end-to-end framework for blind face restoration. Models long-range dependencies to reduce over-smoothing and recover more facial details.

(2) Develops aggregated attention module to extract both global and local information from the low-quality input.  

(3) Constructs a large-scale test benchmark (Casia-Test) with 10K+ identities and diversity in ethnicity, age, occlusion to evaluate generalization.

(4) Extensive experiments show BFRFormer outperforms state-of-the-art on one synthetic dataset and four real-world datasets in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose BFRFormer, a Transformer-based blind face restoration method embedded in a GAN framework to reconstruct images with more identity-preserved details. 

2) They develop an aggregated attention module combining channel attention and double attention to activate more effective pixels from the low-quality input for face restoration.
