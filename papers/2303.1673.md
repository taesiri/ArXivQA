# [Near Optimal Memory-Regret Tradeoff for Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.1673)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the fundamental question of whether it is possible to obtain low regret in the online learning with experts problem using limited memory. The key hypothesis is that there exist algorithms that can achieve vanishing regret (i.e. regret that is o(T) where T is the number of rounds) while using only sublinear memory in the number of experts n and the number of rounds T. 

Specifically, the paper makes the following main contributions:

1. For the oblivious adversary setting, the paper presents an algorithm that obtains ~O(sqrt(nT/S)) regret using only S memory, nearly matching the lower bound of Ω(sqrt(nT/S)) from prior work. This resolves the open question of whether vanishing regret is possible with limited memory against an oblivious adversary.

2. For the adaptive adversary setting, the paper gives an algorithm that obtains ~O(sqrt(nT/S)) regret with ~O(sqrt(n)) memory, proving that sublinear memory suffices to obtain vanishing regret even against an adaptive adversary. 

3. The paper also provides a new lower bound showing that Ω(sqrt(n)) memory is necessary against an adaptive adversary, proving the optimality of the proposed algorithm.

Overall, this paper significantly advances our understanding of the memory-regret tradeoffs for online learning with experts, obtaining nearly tight upper and lower bounds in both the oblivious and adaptive settings. The techniques introduced, including robust pooling/pruning methods and novel regret amortization schemes, are important contributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a new online learning algorithm against an oblivious adversary that achieves near-optimal memory-regret tradeoff. Specifically, the algorithm uses $\text{polylog}(nT)$ space and obtains $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret, nearly matching the lower bound of Ω(\sqrt{nT/S}) proved in prior work. This resolves the open question on optimal memory-regret tradeoff posed by previous work. 

2. It gives the first online learning algorithm against an adaptive adversary that achieves sublinear regret using sublinear space. In particular, the algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ space and achieves $o(T)$ regret.

3. It provides a novel lower bound showing that $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ space is necessary to obtain $o(T)$ regret against an adaptive adversary. This lower bound is based on a reduction to the direct sum problem in communication complexity.

4. The techniques introduced, including the eviction rules for maintaining experts, interval regret guarantees, and the accounting scheme for amortizing regret, seem novel and potentially useful for other online learning problems.

In summary, this paper significantly advances our understanding of the interplay between memory and regret in online learning against oblivious and adaptive adversaries. The memory-regret tradeoffs obtained are essentially optimal, resolving open questions from prior work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper provides improved algorithms and lower bounds for online learning with limited memory against oblivious and adaptive adversaries, nearly resolving the memory-regret tradeoff.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several important contributions to the field of online learning theory with limited memory:

1. It presents new algorithms for online learning against oblivious and adaptive adversaries that achieve near-optimal memory-regret tradeoffs. Specifically, against an oblivious adversary the algorithm achieves Õ(nT/S) regret using S memory, nearly matching known lower bounds. Against an adaptive adversary, the algorithm achieves Õ(√nT/S) regret using S memory. 

2. The algorithm against oblivious adversaries improves upon prior work by Peng and Zhang (2022) by using a more sophisticated eviction strategy and analysis. Key innovations include a "covering benchmark" for deciding which experts to evict, as well as a robust eviction procedure that is insensitive to changes in the expert pool. 

3. The algorithm against adaptive adversaries is novel, as prior work focused on oblivious adversaries. The high level approach of maintaining a pool of "random" and "long-term" experts is new in this context. The analysis relating the performance of random and long-term experts is also novel.

4. The lower bound against adaptive adversaries of Ω(√n/ε) memory for o(ε^2T) regret is new. The reduction to a communication problem and application of direct product theorems is an interesting proof technique in this setting. 

5. The work further develops the nascent area of understanding memory-regret tradeoffs in online learning. It significantly improves tradeoffs for both oblivious and adaptive adversaries compared to prior work, and leaves open many interesting questions on tight tradeoffs in other settings.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in memory-limited online learning through new algorithmic ideas and lower bound techniques. The near tight bounds obtained are a major advance over prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying the ideas to develop sub-linear space algorithms for other online learning problems and applications where experts advice is used. The authors suggest it is interesting to see if their techniques can lead to better space-bounded algorithms for multi-arm bandits, pure exploration, game playing agents, optimization algorithms, etc. that rely on experts.

- Understanding the memory-regret tradeoffs with additional structure on the experts or loss functions. The general worst-case bounds may not be tight if there is extra structure like small Littlestone dimension for the experts or succinct representation for loss vectors. 

- Developing algorithms that work in more restrictive models like bandit feedback. The current work relies heavily on full-information feedback so extending the techniques to bandit settings is an open direction.

- Improving the space complexity and regret bounds. There is still a gap between the upper and lower bounds so closing this gap in terms of dependence on key parameters is an open problem.

- Generalizing the adaptive adversary results. The adaptive bounds currently hold for the standard adversary but extending them to other notions like the stronger adaptive adversary is an open question.

- Applying the techniques for online learning with restrictions on memory to other machine learning problems with limited memory, like continual learning.

So in summary, the main directions are: exploring applications to other online learning settings, incorporating structural assumptions, considering bandit feedback, tightening bounds, handling stronger adversaries, and connections to broader machine learning problems with memory constraints. The combination of online learning and space-bounded computation seems like a fruitful area for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies the problem of online learning with limited memory, where the learner has insufficient space to store information about all experts over many time steps. It focuses on the tradeoff between the memory used by the learner and the regret, which measures how much worse the learner performs compared to the best expert in hindsight. The paper gives a new algorithm against an oblivious adversary, improving upon prior work and nearly matching a known lower bound. It also considers an adaptive adversary and gives both a new algorithm and a novel lower bound, showing that roughly √n memory is necessary and sufficient to obtain a sublinear regret. The algorithms are simple and computationally efficient, using ideas like robust pooling, merging and pruning of experts. The lower bounds employ reductions from communication complexity problems. Overall, the paper significantly advances our understanding of the memory requirements for online learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies the memory-regret tradeoffs for the online learning with expert advice problem. In this problem, there are n experts and over T rounds, the learner has to pick one expert per round and suffers the loss of that expert, while observing the losses of all experts. The goal is to minimize regret, which is the difference between the learner's total loss and the loss of the best expert in hindsight. 

The paper provides new algorithms and lower bounds for this problem in the limited memory setting, where the learner cannot store the entire history. For an oblivious adversary, the paper gives an algorithm using polylog(nT) memory that achieves nearly optimal Õ(√nT) regret. For an adaptive adversary, the paper gives an Õ(sqrt(n)/eps) memory algorithm with O(epsT) regret. It also proves an Ω(sqrt(n)/eps) memory lower bound, showing the algorithm is nearly optimal. The techniques involve carefully merging and filtering experts while bounding the memory, exploiting properties of second order regret algorithms, and reductions from communication complexity problems. Overall, this provides an almost complete understanding of the memory-regret tradeoff for online learning against oblivious and adaptive adversaries.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a new online learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal memory-regret tradeoffs against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries. For the oblivious setting, the key ideas are a new eviction rule based on covering benchmarks and a robust merging procedure to control the pool size. The algorithm runs in epochs, maintaining disjoint subpools that are merged periodically. Experts are evicted if covered by a filter set, selected in a way that is insensitive to perturbations. To optimize regret, multiple threads with inherited pools are maintained, and regret is amortized over carefully constructed intervals. For the adaptive setting, the algorithm maintains random short-term experts to hedge performance and selectively retains good experts for longer epochs. The analysis handles adaptive attacks by isolating randomness and reducing to an oblivious adversary per epoch. Overall, the methods develop new techniques for online learning under memory constraints, achieving near-optimal regret while using limited space.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper addresses the fundamental tradeoff between memory usage and regret guarantees in online learning algorithms. Specifically, it considers the online learning problem where an agent sequentially makes decisions by following the advice of "experts", and after each decision observes the loss incurred by all experts. 

The key question is - how well can an agent perform if it has limited memory and cannot store full information about all experts over a long time horizon? 

Previous work showed tight memory-regret tradeoffs when losses are i.i.d. or randomly ordered. This paper focuses on the setting without stochastic assumptions, considering both an oblivious adversary and an adaptive adversary.

The main contributions are:

1) An improved algorithm against an oblivious adversary, attaining nearly optimal memory-regret tradeoffs.

2) The first algorithm and lower bound for the adaptive adversary case, showing that $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ memory is both necessary and sufficient for obtaining sublinear regret.

So in summary, this paper pushes forward our understanding of the interplay between memory and regret in online learning, providing tight bounds in the non-stochastic setting for both oblivious and adaptive adversaries. The techniques develop new ideas like robust pooling mechanisms and careful epoch accounting that may find broader applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, some key terms and concepts include:

- Online learning - The problem of an agent making sequential decisions in an unknown, changing environment. The abstract focuses on the experts setting where the agent chooses between advice from different "experts".

- Regret - The difference between the agent's cumulative loss and the loss of the single best expert in hindsight. Minimizing regret is a key goal. 

- Memory bounds - Studying online learning algorithms that use limited memory, as opposed to traditional algorithms that may require remembering all experts' losses so far.

- Oblivious vs adaptive adversary - The abstract considers both an oblivious adversary who chooses losses ahead of time, and an adaptive adversary who can react to the agent's past actions.

- Memory-regret tradeoff - A main contribution is characterizing the tradeoff between the amount of memory used by the algorithm and the regret it can achieve.

- Lower bounds - The abstract provides both upper bounds (new algorithms) and lower bounds, showing limitations on what is possible with limited memory.

In summary, this seems to be a theoretical computer science paper studying fundamental tradeoffs between memory and regret in online learning against different types of adversaries. The key innovations are new algorithms and lower bound techniques for this problem.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key contributions of this paper:

This paper studies the fundamental online learning problem where an agent sequentially makes decisions based on the advice of experts, with the goal of minimizing regret. A major open question is whether it is possible to obtain vanishing regret without needing to remember the full history of expert advice. This paper makes progress on this question against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries. For oblivious adversaries, the authors give an algorithm obtaining near-optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nT/S})$ regret using $S$ memory, resolving the open question posed by prior work. Their algorithm introduces new techniques for maintaining a small pool of useful experts via insensitive merging and pruning. For adaptive adversaries, the authors give the first algorithm obtaining sublinear regret $o(T)$ using sublinear $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ memory. They also prove an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ memory lower bound, showing their algorithm is near-optimal. The algorithm for adaptive adversaries maintains experts at multiple timescales and frequencies to hedge against adaptivity. The lower bound constructively establishes limitations of low-memory algorithms against adaptivity using information-theoretic tools. Together, these results significantly advance our understanding of the memory-regret tradeoff for online learning.

This paper studies the fundamental online learning problem with expert advice under memory constraints. The authors give near optimal algorithms and lower bounds for the oblivious and adaptive adversary settings. For the oblivious adversary, they provide an algorithm achieving vanishing regret while using only polylogarithmic memory, nearly matching the lower bound of Woodruff et al (STOC '22).
