# [Mistake, Manipulation and Margin Guarantees in Online Strategic   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the problem of online strategic classification, where agents arrive sequentially with feature vectors and associated binary labels. Agents can manipulate their feature vectors, at a cost, to try to obtain a positive label prediction. The learner aims to predict the true labels, despite having access only to the potentially manipulated features from the strategic agents. 

Proposed Solutions:
The paper proposes three algorithms:

1. Strategic Maximum Margin (SMM) algorithm: At each step, solves an optimization problem to find the maximum margin classifier on "proxy data", which are estimates of the true features constructed using revealed labels. Provides explicit bounds on mistakes and manipulations. Converges to optimal margin classifier.

2. Gradient-based SMM: Approximation of SMM using online subgradient updates instead of full optimization. Computationally cheaper but converges slower. Still enjoys mistake, manipulation bounds and convergence guarantees.

3. Generalized Strategic Perceptron: Extension of existing strategic perceptron algorithm to handle more general manipulation cost functions. Enjoyes finite mistake bounds under certain conditions.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes concept of "proxy data" in strategic classification and shows separability guarantees. Enables design of max-margin style algorithms.

- Proves finite mistake and manipulation bounds for SMM algorithm. Shows convergence to optimal margin classifier. 

- Shows gradient-based SMM retains convergence guarantees with cheaper updates.

- Generalizes strategic perceptron algorithm and proves mistake bounds for broader range of settings.

- Provides numerical study on real and synthetic data showing SMM and gradient SMM significantly outperform strategic perceptron in terms of mistakes, manipulations and classifier quality.

The paper makes notable contributions in developing new algorithms for online strategic classification with theoretical guarantees and demonstrates their strong empirical performance.
