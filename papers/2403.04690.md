# [Faster Neighborhood Attention: Reducing the O(n^2) Cost of Self   Attention at the Threadblock Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Attention mechanisms are widely used in deep learning models but suffer from high computational complexity, especially in the case of self-attention where the attention is computed between every token in the input. This quadratic complexity limits their applicability.
- Prior works like neighborhood attention reduce this complexity by restricting attention to local neighborhoods but faced challenges in efficient implementation, especially in higher dimensional inputs like images. Custom kernels had limitations in performance and functionality.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper formulates neighborhood attention as a batched GEMM problem instead of less efficient GEMV, allowing utilization of optimized GEMM kernels. 
- Two implementations are proposed - GEMM-based neighborhood attention using modified batched GEMM, and fused neighborhood attention extending ideas from fused dot-product attention kernels.
- These support attention in 1D, 2D and 3D spaces with features like varying window sizes and dilation factors across dimensions.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation to map neighborhood attention to batched GEMM problem for efficient implementation
- GEMM-based kernels providing 895% and 272% lower latency compared to prior 1D and 2D custom kernels 
- Fused kernels reducing memory footprint and further improving latency, outperforming GEMM kernels as well 
- Extensive benchmarking showing significant improvements in throughput across various models employing neighborhood attention
- Highly parameterized, extensible kernels supporting causal masking and different attention patterns across dimensions

The main outcome is performant and flexible kernels that can greatly accelerate research and adoption of neighborhood attention mechanisms in vision models while reducing memory overhead.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes new GEMM-based and fused CUDA kernels to efficiently implement neighborhood attention, a variant of self-attention that restricts each token's attention to its nearest neighbors, achieving over 10x speedup compared to prior implementations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing two new methods for efficiently implementing neighborhood attention:

1) GEMM-based kernels that formulate neighborhood attention as a batched GEMM problem, allowing it to leverage highly optimized GEMM routines. These kernels provide up to 895% and 272% speedup on average over previous naive CUDA kernels for 1D and 2D neighborhood attention respectively.

2) Fused kernels that keep all intermediate attention weights on-chip without writing to global memory. By fusing the attention computation, these kernels reduce memory footprint and can outperform even the GEMM-based kernels, providing over 1000% speedup on average compared to previous approaches. The fused kernels are also more flexible and extensible.

In summary, the paper introduces GEMM-based and fused CUDA kernels to accelerate neighborhood attention, which is an important attention variant, by better mapping it to the underlying hardware. This enables faster research and adoption of models based on neighborhood attention.

The paper introduces GEMM-based and fused CUDA kernels to accelerate neighborhood attention, which restricts the context of each token to its nearest neighbors to reduce the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Key goals are to improve inference speed and reduce memory footprint compared to existing approaches. The methodology leverages concepts like GEMM, GEMV, CUTLASS library, and Tensor Cores to optimize performance on GPUs. The benefits are demonstrated on image classification and style-based image generation models using neighborhood attention.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two new implementations of neighborhood attention - GEMM-based and fused kernels. How do these new implementations conceptually differ from existing "naive" CUDA kernels for neighborhood attention? What are the key innovations that allow expressing neighborhood attention as a GEMM problem?

2. The paper points out some bottlenecks with existing neighborhood attention implementations, especially in lower precision modes. What is the key limitation that bounds the performance of unfused implementations and hinders their lower precision scalability? How do the proposed fused kernels circumvent this bottleneck?

3. The methodology section describes changes made to standard batched GEMM kernels in order to express neighborhood attention as a GEMM problem. Can you elaborate on the space-aware tiling strategy and the customizations made to pointer iterators and accessors? How do these help optimize performance?

4. How does the proposed fused neighborhood attention formulation extend concepts from the batched GEMM methodology? Explain the compile-time logic and runtime execution strategy used for space-aware tiling and attention masking in the fused kernels.

5. The paper benchmarked the proposed kernels extensively. Analyze the benchmark results in Tables 2 and 3. Why do the fused kernels consistently outperform GEMM-based kernels, especially in lower precision modes? What hardware factors contribute to this performance gap?

6. Based on the analysis in subsection 4.3, what are some unavoidable sources of overhead when switching from standard self-attention to neighborhood attention, especially in higher rank spaces? How can these overheads be reduced in future work? 

7. The paper demonstrates throughput improvements from using the new kernels in ImageNet classification models. Compare model-level speedups observed in FP16 vs FP32 modes. Why are improvements larger in lower precision modes?

8. For the NAT and DiNAT models benchmarked, analyze how choice of kernel impacts throughput for different model sizes and complexities. What trends do you observe in terms of model scaling?

9. The paper does not provide backpropagation support currently. What are the challenges involved in supporting backward passes efficiently? Would the fused formulation have advantages over GEMM-based kernels here too?

10. The current implementation supports varying window sizes and dilation factors across spatial axes. Discuss other feature extensions like supporting data-dependent window sizes that would further improve flexibility of these kernels.
