# [Extraction of nonlinearity in neural networks and model compression with   Koopman operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks have a very large number of parameters, making them difficult to deploy on devices with limited computational resources. 
- Existing model compression techniques like pruning and quantization can reduce model size but sacrifice accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage Koopman operator theory from dynamical systems to analyze and compress neural networks. 
- Treat the internal process of a trained neural network as a nonlinear dynamical system. 
- Use Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) to get a finite-dimensional linear approximation (Koopman matrix) of this nonlinear system.
- Replace intermediate layers of the network with this Koopman matrix to get a compressed model.
- Optionally compress the Koopman matrix further using singular value decomposition.

Main Contributions:
- Show that neural networks have redundant nonlinearity, so a linear Koopman matrix can approximate intermediate layers fairly well.
- Propose a model compression technique using Koopman theory that replaces activation functions with linear algebra.
- Achieve compression ratios of 5x or more with minimal loss of accuracy compared to pruning methods. 
- Demonstrate how tensor train format can investigate effects of nonlinearity in high-dimensional systems like neural networks.
- Overall, open up new possibilities of analyzing and compressing neural networks using dynamical systems theory.

In summary, the paper proposes a way to leverage Koopman operator theory to replace nonlinear intermediate layers in a trained neural network with linear Koopman matrices. This provides a novel model compression technique that can reduce model size significantly while maintaining accuracy.
