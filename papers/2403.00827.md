# [Self-Refinement of Language Models from External Proxy Metrics Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are often expected to capture multiple objectives/principles when generating responses, such as relevance, groundedness, etc. However, it is challenging for LLMs to optimize and balance tradeoffs across multiple principles simultaneously.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes an algorithm called Proxy Metric-based Self-Refinement (ProMiSe) that enables an LLM to iteratively refine its own initial response to better conform to key principles. 
- ProMiSe uses external proxy metrics to provide feedback signals related to different principles (e.g. specificity, faithfulness). If the initial response fails to meet sufficiency thresholds for the proxy metrics, ProMiSe performs principle-specific refinements one at a time using few-shot in-context learning prompts.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a novel domain-agnostic self-refinement algorithm that leverages external proxy metric feedback to enable principle-guided refinement.
- Applies ProMiSe to content-grounded question answering and dialogue tasks. Shows consistent improvements in response quality metrics through self-refinement.
- Demonstrates that fine-tuning on synthetic dialogues generated by ProMiSe significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and supervised models.
- Provides analysis showing proxy metric score changes positively correlate with improvements in downstream eval metrics, validating efficacy.
- Enables smaller LLMs to successfully perform self-refinement, which has been challenging in prior work.

In summary, the key innovation is an iterative approach using external proxy metrics to provide feedback signals for principle-specific self-refinement in LLMs. When applied to dialog tasks, this demonstrably improves response quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces ProMiSe, an algorithm that enables language models to refine their own responses by iteratively improving them along multiple principles guided by external proxy metric feedback, and shows its effectiveness in content-grounded question answering and dialogue tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a novel domain-agnostic algorithm, ProMiSe (Proxy Metric-based Self-Refinement), to perform multi-aspect self-refinement of language models on desirable principles for a response through in-context learning, using proxy metrics as external quality feedback.

2) ProMiSe is applied to both content-grounded single-turn question answering and multi-turn dialogue generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness in improving response quality in both few-shot learning and supervised fine-tuning setups.  

3) The paper analyzes the relationship between the change in proxy metric scores and downstream evaluation metrics, revealing an unsupervised correlation and reinforcing the efficacy of the proposed method.

In summary, the key contribution is the ProMiSe algorithm that enables language models to refine their own responses iteratively based on external feedback from proxy metrics, in order to improve quality along multiple principles such as specificity, accuracy, and relevance. This is shown to work for smaller models like Flan-T5 and Llama, provides consistent improvements on various metrics, and the synthetic dialogues generated can further improve performance when used for fine-tuning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Self-refinement - The paper introduces an approach called ProMiSe (Proxy Metric-based Self-Refinement) to enable language models to iteratively refine their own initial responses to improve quality along multiple dimensions. 

- Proxy metrics - External metrics used to provide feedback to guide the self-refinement process, representing principles like relevance, consistency, specificity, and faithfulness. Examples used include ROUGE metrics and the WeCheck factual consistency checker.

- Principle-guided - The self-refinement process is guided by explicit principles that define desired aspects of high-quality responses. Principles like specificity, faithfulness, and relevance/consistency are used.

- Iterative refinement - Responses are refined one principle at a time in an iterative fashion by generating principle-specific refinements based on few-shot in-context learning prompts.

- Document-grounded QA - The method is applied to document-grounded question answering tasks where responses should be grounded in and consistent with a reference text. Datasets used include MultiDoc2Dial and QuAC.

- LLM evaluation - Various automatic metrics are used to evaluate quality improvements from self-refinement, including ROUGE, BERT Score, Recall, etc. GPT-4 is also used as an automated judge.

- Dialogue generation - The self-refinement technique is extended to multi-turn dialogue generation, where both user queries and agent responses are synthesized.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does ProMiSe leverage proxy metrics to provide external feedback on response quality for refining language models? What types of proxy metrics are used in the paper and why?

2. What is the motivation behind ProMiSe's approach of iterative, single-principle refinement as opposed to simultaneous refinement across multiple principles? How does this align with how humans refine their own responses?

3. How does ProMiSe determine when to stop refinement? What criteria are used to decide whether a refined response is sufficiently improved or not? 

4. How are the in-context examples for refinement prompts created in ProMiSe? What makes them effective demonstrations for conveying the target principles to refine upon?

5. How configurable and customizable is ProMiSe based on the given examples in the paper? Could other principles, metrics, datasets etc. be easily incorporated? What would need to change?

6. Why does ProMiSe seem to be more effective for smaller models like Flan-T5 and LLama compared to other self-refinement techniques? What limitations does it help overcome?

7. How rigorous and thorough is the threshold calibration and analysis to select appropriate proxy metrics and sufficiency criteria? What other analyses could be done?  

8. What implications does the unsupervised correlation between proxy metric improvements and downstream metric improvements have? How does this validate the approach?

9. How creative and natural are the synthetic dialogues produced by ProMiSe? What qualitative aspects and diversity metrics could be used to evaluate them?

10. What other language tasks could ProMiSe be extended to besides content-grounded QA and dialogue? What components would need to change or be replaced?
