# [Know Your Needs Better: Towards Structured Understanding of Marketer   Demands with Analogical Reasoning Augmented LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current user targeting systems have gaps between marketers' natural language demands and models' capabilities, requiring tedious and error-prone manual work. 
- Marketers need to decompose demands into multiple tags/entities. This is unfriendly, time-consuming and has suboptimal performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new language "SELL" to express targeting demands more clearly.
- Present an "Analogic Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model" (ARALLM) framework to automatically transform natural language demands to SELL.
- ARALLM has two key components:
   1) Analogical Reasoning based Prompting: Retrieve similar examples to provide reasoning references and compatibility prompts.
   2) Reasoning-Augmented Multi-Task Distillation: Distill knowledge from teacher LLMs into a dataset, and conduct multi-task fine-tuning on student LLMs.

Main Contributions:  
- Define the NL2SELL task to structurally understand marketer demands.
- Propose the ARALLM framework to address NL2SELL via analogical reasoning prompts and reasoning-augmented model distillation.
- Demonstrate ARALLM's superiority through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The framework enhances reasoning accuracy and model deployment efficiency.
- The system has been deployed online, significantly boosting efficiency in practical user targeting applications.

In summary, the paper explores automatic structured understanding of marketer demands via the new ARALLM framework. This helps bridge the gap between demands and model capabilities in user targeting systems. Both reasoning accuracy and deployment efficiency are enhanced.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called ARALLM, consisting of Analogical Reasoning based Prompting and Reasoning-Augmented Multi-Task Model Distillation, to automatically transform natural language descriptions of marketer demands into structured logical expressions in a new language SELL to enable faster and more effective user targeting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new structured and editable logical language called SELL to represent marketer's targeting demands, along with a new task of translating natural language demands to SELL (NL2SELL). 

2. It develops an analogical reasoning based prompting method to enhance the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in solving the complex NL2SELL task. This prompting method retrieves similar examples from a reasoning library and uses their reasoning steps to guide the LLM.

3. It proposes a reasoning-augmented multi-task knowledge distillation method to transfer knowledge from teacher LLMs like ChatGPT into smaller student LLMs that are more suitable for deployment. This involves generating reasoning steps as additional supervision.

4. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods through experiments on real-world marketing datasets. The analogical prompting boosts ChatGPT's performance on NL2SELL. The distilled smaller LLM also approaches ChatGPT's capability, showing the promise of deployment.

5. It designs and implements an online system with the distilled LLM to understand marketer's targeting demand automatically. Quantitative analysis shows the new system significantly improves efficiency and satisfaction.

In summary, the key contribution is developing methods to transform natural language targeting demands into structured logic forms automatically using LLMs, to bridge the gap between marketers and targeting systems. Both prompting and distillation innovations help unlock the reasoning capability of LLMs for this practical application.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- User targeting 
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Analogical reasoning
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting

The paper explores using large language models for structured understanding of marketer demands for user targeting. It proposes the SELL language and NL2SELL task for transforming natural language demands into the structured SELL format. The key methods proposed are analogical reasoning based prompting to enhance reasoning in LLMs, and distillation plus multi-task fine-tuning to develop smaller models for deployment. The ARALLM framework integrates these techniques. So these are some of the core terms and concepts associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the proposed SELL language compare to existing structured languages like SQL in terms of expressivity and ease of use for non-experts? What modifications were made to simplify it?

2. What retrieval-based embedding model works best for finding analogous examples from the reasoning library? Did you experiment with other embedding techniques beyond BGE? 

3. How was the reasoning library constructed? What was the process and criteria for selecting high-quality reasoning examples to include? 

4. What prompts work best for the teacher LLM (ChatGPT) to generate high-quality reasoning steps for the examples in the training data? 

5. Does fine-tuning smaller LLMs with intermediate reasoning step prediction consistently improve performance over standard supervised learning? Were other auxiliary training techniques explored?

6. How sensitive is model performance to the number and quality of analogical examples retrieved during prompting? Is there a sweet spot or does more always help?  

7. Could the analogical reasoning approach be applied successfully to other structured language translation tasks beyond marketing like coding problems or parsing web content?

8. How was the SELL parser designed and implemented? What modifications were required to visualize output for the application interface?  

9. What metrics beyond operation time and marketer feedback are used to evaluate system performance online? Is offline eval correlation analyzed?  

10. How might the approach be expanded to support iterative refinement of targeting demands based on initial outputs? Could active learning help improve the reasoning library over time?
