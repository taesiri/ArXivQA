# [Natural-artificial hybrid swarm: Cyborg-insect group navigation in   unknown obstructed soft terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Swarm navigation with groups of robots is challenging due to limitations in collision avoidance, adapting to unknown environments, and energy efficiency. 
- Using living insects integrated with electronics (cyborg insects) can overcome these limitations, but controlling swarms of cyborg insects poses difficulties due to variability in individual insect reactions.
- Previous works have only demonstrated control of single cyborg insects. The problem of controlling a swarm of cyborg insects has not been previously addressed.

Proposed Solution:
- A swarm navigation algorithm is proposed to guide a swarm of cyborg insects with a leader and followers to a goal location in an unknown environment with obstacles and hills.  
- The algorithm has two components: 
   1) A motion planning rule based on observed tourist group behavior that allows free motion when the leader is visible and motion towards the swarm when the leader is not visible.
   2) A trajectory tracking rule that calculates steering and acceleration signals to guide each follower cyborg.
- This bio-inspired Tour Group Inspired (TGI) control algorithm allows cyborgs to leverage innate insect behaviors for efficiency and avoids issues like habituation or battery drain from excessive stimulations.

Contributions:
- First demonstration of control of a multi-cyborg insect swarm system for navigation in an unknown environment.
- A novel, decentralized control algorithm inspired by human group behavior that gives free motion priority, enhancing efficiency and robustness.  
- Experimental validation with 10 trials showing the cyborg swarm successfully navigated to the goal through obstructed terrain guided only by local information.
- Emergent swarm behaviors are observed like helping overturned cyborgs recover faster and escaping entrapments.
- The results showcase the potential of integrating biological organisms with robotics and control theory to create intelligent, adaptive systems.
