# [Multi-Outputs Is All You Need For Deblur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13029)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we improve image deblurring performance by having the model learn the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions corresponding to a blurry input image, rather than just learning to predict a single expected sharp image?

The key points are:

- Image deblurring is an ill-posed problem with many possible feasible solutions for mapping a blurry image to a sharp one. 

- Standard supervised learning approaches train models to predict just one expected sharp image corresponding to each blurry input. But this expected solution may not match any of the actual feasible sharp solutions well.

- The authors propose a multi-head network architecture and training approach to have the model learn a distribution of feasible solutions instead of just the expected solution. 

- They use a k-means style algorithm during training to cluster the solutions into multiple heads and train each head to generate one cluster of solutions.

- A head combination method is also proposed to further improve utilization of the heads by combining them into extended outputs.

- Experiments show this multi-head approach improves performance over standard single output models by better capturing the distribution of feasible solutions.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that learning the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions will improve deblurring compared to learning just the expected solution, and they propose a multi-head architecture and training approach to achieve this distribution learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. They point out that in image deblurring tasks, using a single labeled image for supervision can lead to the model outputting images that are not in the distribution of feasible solutions. This is because image deblurring is an ill-posed problem with multiple possible solutions.

2. They propose to train the model to learn the distribution of feasible sharp images, rather than just the expectation. To do this, they use a multi-head network architecture and an EM-like algorithm to cluster the sharp images into multiple groups. The model is trained to output the cluster centers. 

3. They further propose a head combination method to combine the outputs of different heads in pairs. This reduces the parameters of the output layer and enhances connections between heads. 

4. They evaluate their approach by extending several existing image deblurring models, including NAFNet, Restormer, HiNet, and MPRNet. The experiments show improved quantitative results compared to the single-output baselines, with the multi-head NAFNet achieving state-of-the-art performance on the GoPro dataset.

5. They provide analysis showing that the multi-head outputs generate multiple diverse solutions concentrated on blurry regions, which approximates the distribution of feasible sharp images.

In summary, the key ideas are using a multi-head model and specialized training approach to learn the distribution of solutions for ill-posed image deblurring, instead of just a single solution. This improves performance and generates more realistic outputs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-head output architecture and loss function to enable image deblurring models to learn the distribution of sharp images corresponding to a blurry input, rather than just the expectation, along with a head combination method to improve utilization and reduce parameters.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in image deblurring and distribution learning:

- Most prior work in image deblurring focuses on estimating the blur kernel or using end-to-end supervised learning with a single target sharp image as the label. This paper argues that using a single label image is problematic since there are many feasible sharp images corresponding to a blurry input. 

- The paper proposes a novel semi-supervised multi-output approach to learn the distribution of feasible sharp images instead of just a single target. This is a unique perspective compared to typical supervised approaches.

- The multi-output model with loss specifically designed to learn clusters representing the distribution is novel for image deblurring. The head combination method to enhance connections between outputs is also novel.

- For distribution learning, typical approaches like VAEs make strong assumptions about the form of the distribution. This paper uses a more flexible cluster-based distribution approximation with an EM-style algorithm.

- Experiments demonstrate clear improvements in PSNR over single output models like NAFNet across datasets. The analysis also provides insights into how the multi-output model generates diverse solutions.

In summary, the key novelties are the distribution learning perspective, multi-output architecture, and training approach designed for image deblurring. The results demonstrate improved performance over other end-to-end supervised methods that use a single target sharp image. The analysis also provides some interesting insights into the behavior of the model.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluate the proposed multi-head architecture and training approach on other image restoration tasks like super-resolution, denoising, etc. The authors suggest their method of learning the distribution of solutions could be beneficial for other ill-posed image restoration problems.

- Explore different head combination strategies beyond simple averaging. The authors propose averaging the multi-head outputs, but other fusion methods could be explored. 

- Apply the multi-head approach to blind image restoration where no ground truth sharp image is available. The authors suggest their method could help generate multiple feasible solutions for blind tasks.

- Investigate conditional generation with multi-heads, where conditioning information like blur kernel or noise level controls the output distribution. This could improve generalization.

- Extend the approach to video restoration tasks like deblurring or super-resolution. The multi-head output could model distribution of temporally consistent solutions.

- Analyze the learned distribution more deeply, such as which modes capture common defects vs. rare events. This could provide insight for model improvement.

- Explore uncertainty estimation using the multi-head outputs. The variation between outputs could help quantify model uncertainty.

So in summary, the main future directions are applying the approach to other tasks, exploring output combinations, extending to blind restoration and video, analyzing the learned distributions, and leveraging for uncertainty estimation. Overall, the authors propose many interesting ways to build on their presented multi-head distribution learning approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-head output architecture and corresponding loss function for image deblurring models to better learn the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions rather than just the expectation (i.e. label). The model outputs multiple sharp images and only backpropagates the loss from the output closest to the label, approximating an EM algorithm for clustering. This enables generating multiple feasible solutions. They also propose combining the output heads in pairs through averaging to reduce parameters and computations while enhancing connections between heads. Experiments on MPRNet, HiNet, Restormer and NAFNet models show gains of 0.04-0.14dB PSNR on GoPro and HIDE datasets. The multi-head NAFNet achieves state-of-the-art 33.82dB on GoPro. Analysis shows the multi-heads generate diverse solutions differing mainly in blurry regions, proving the method enables approximating the distribution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-head output architecture and loss function to learn the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions for image deblurring, rather than just the expectation (typical label). The authors argue that supervised learning with a single labeled sharp image forces the model to predict that exact image rather than the distribution of plausible solutions. To address this, they propose using multiple output heads, each predicting a different plausible sharp image restoration. An EM algorithm is used to assign labels to the closest output head cluster and update the head parameters. 

To further improve utilization of the heads, the authors propose combining outputs in pairs through addition. This allows more extended outputs to be generated without linearly increasing parameters. Experiments on MPRNet, HiNet, Restormer, and NAFNet show performance gains over single output models in PSNR and SSIM on GoPro and HIDE datasets. With 4 output heads and head combination, NAFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Analysis shows the multi-head outputs differ primarily around blurry regions and represent alternate plausible solutions. Overall, this method generates sharper results by modeling the distribution of solutions rather than just the expectation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-head output architecture and training strategy to learn the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions for a given blurry input, rather than just the expectation (i.e. the labeled sharp image). The distribution of sharp images is approximated by multiple cluster centers generated by the multi-head outputs. An EM algorithm is used during training where the E-step assigns each sharp label to its closest cluster center, and the M-step updates the cluster center outputs based on their assigned labels. To allow more cluster centers without linearly increasing parameters, the outputs are combined in pairs through addition to generate an extended set of outputs. Experiments show this multi-output approach improves performance over single output baselines. Key benefits are allowing outputs to specialize for difficult out-of-distribution examples while avoiding negative impacts on main output training, and representing more of the distribution to achieve sharper results.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and questions addressed in this paper are:

- Image deblurring is an ill-posed problem with many feasible solutions for a given blurry image. 

- Existing supervised learning methods for image deblurring train models to output a single image (e.g. the middle frame) as the target, but this may not capture the full distribution of feasible solutions.

- The paper proposes that models should learn the distribution of feasible sharp images rather than just a single target. 

- The core questions are: How can models learn this distribution of solutions rather than just a single target? How can this be implemented efficiently in existing image deblurring networks?

In summary, this paper proposes a multi-output model and training approach to better learn the distribution of feasible solutions for image deblurring, rather than just fitting a single target image. The key questions are around how to formulate and implement this multi-output distribution learning effectively.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-head output architecture and semi-supervised training strategy to learn the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions for deblurring, rather than just the expectation. The authors point out that existing datasets define blurry/sharp pairs somewhat arbitrarily, while in reality there are multiple feasible sharp solutions corresponding to a blurry input. They propose using a model with multiple output heads, where each head produces a different feasible solution. An EM-like algorithm is used for training, where the model outputs from all heads are compared against the blurry/sharp pair, and only the head with lowest loss is backpropagated - effectively clustering the solutions. Furthermore, they propose combining outputs from different heads to obtain extended multi-head outputs, reducing parameters while enhancing connections between heads. Experiments on multiple models like NAFNet demonstrate that both the best overall PSNR and best single head PSNR consistently improve over baselines. The multi-head model is able to generate multiple high-quality solutions with perceptible diversity, especially in blurry regions, indicating successful modeling of the distribution. This approach provides SOTA results on benchmark datasets, advancing the state of the art in deep learning based deblurring.
