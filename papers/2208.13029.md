# [Multi-Outputs Is All You Need For Deblur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13029)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve image deblurring performance by having the model learn the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions corresponding to a blurry input image, rather than just learning to predict a single expected sharp image?The key points are:- Image deblurring is an ill-posed problem with many possible feasible solutions for mapping a blurry image to a sharp one. - Standard supervised learning approaches train models to predict just one expected sharp image corresponding to each blurry input. But this expected solution may not match any of the actual feasible sharp solutions well.- The authors propose a multi-head network architecture and training approach to have the model learn a distribution of feasible solutions instead of just the expected solution. - They use a k-means style algorithm during training to cluster the solutions into multiple heads and train each head to generate one cluster of solutions.- A head combination method is also proposed to further improve utilization of the heads by combining them into extended outputs.- Experiments show this multi-head approach improves performance over standard single output models by better capturing the distribution of feasible solutions.In summary, the main hypothesis is that learning the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions will improve deblurring compared to learning just the expected solution, and they propose a multi-head architecture and training approach to achieve this distribution learning.
