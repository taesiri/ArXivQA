# [Multi-Outputs Is All You Need For Deblur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13029)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve image deblurring performance by having the model learn the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions corresponding to a blurry input image, rather than just learning to predict a single expected sharp image?The key points are:- Image deblurring is an ill-posed problem with many possible feasible solutions for mapping a blurry image to a sharp one. - Standard supervised learning approaches train models to predict just one expected sharp image corresponding to each blurry input. But this expected solution may not match any of the actual feasible sharp solutions well.- The authors propose a multi-head network architecture and training approach to have the model learn a distribution of feasible solutions instead of just the expected solution. - They use a k-means style algorithm during training to cluster the solutions into multiple heads and train each head to generate one cluster of solutions.- A head combination method is also proposed to further improve utilization of the heads by combining them into extended outputs.- Experiments show this multi-head approach improves performance over standard single output models by better capturing the distribution of feasible solutions.In summary, the main hypothesis is that learning the distribution of feasible sharp image solutions will improve deblurring compared to learning just the expected solution, and they propose a multi-head architecture and training approach to achieve this distribution learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. They point out that in image deblurring tasks, using a single labeled image for supervision can lead to the model outputting images that are not in the distribution of feasible solutions. This is because image deblurring is an ill-posed problem with multiple possible solutions.2. They propose to train the model to learn the distribution of feasible sharp images, rather than just the expectation. To do this, they use a multi-head network architecture and an EM-like algorithm to cluster the sharp images into multiple groups. The model is trained to output the cluster centers. 3. They further propose a head combination method to combine the outputs of different heads in pairs. This reduces the parameters of the output layer and enhances connections between heads. 4. They evaluate their approach by extending several existing image deblurring models, including NAFNet, Restormer, HiNet, and MPRNet. The experiments show improved quantitative results compared to the single-output baselines, with the multi-head NAFNet achieving state-of-the-art performance on the GoPro dataset.5. They provide analysis showing that the multi-head outputs generate multiple diverse solutions concentrated on blurry regions, which approximates the distribution of feasible sharp images.In summary, the key ideas are using a multi-head model and specialized training approach to learn the distribution of solutions for ill-posed image deblurring, instead of just a single solution. This improves performance and generates more realistic outputs.
