# [Genie: Smart ROS-based Caching for Connected Autonomous Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There are latency issues when running critical intelligence tasks like object detection on autonomous vehicle platforms. Even latest embedded platforms like NVIDIA Xavier fail to execute these tasks in real-time. 
- Using edge computing from remote servers to offload tasks can help, but has limitations: servers not distributed enough, solutions do not provide substantially better performance to justify cost, solutions not compatible with robotics frameworks like ROS.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop Genie, an encapsulation technique to enable transparent caching in ROS without modifying source code. Allows distributed cache construction.  
- Genie has 3 main components:
   1) ROS-based transparent caching: Intercept ROS comms to/from nodes and perform caching without modifying nodes.
   2) Distributed cache construction: Algorithm for Genies to identify and communicate with each other, building local caches.
   3) Object map for vehicles: Build 3D object map using location as key, provides lower latency and higher quality data to vehicles.

Main Contributions:  
- Non-intrusive ROS caching
- Distributed cache design compatible with ROS vehicles
- Driving-specific caching using object map, improves latency & reusability
- Implemented using Autoware on NVIDIA embedded/edge platforms 
- Evaluations show:
   - 82% average latency improvement for Vision Detector
   - 31% average object reusability, up to 67% max
   - Higher quality object map built over time

In summary, the paper proposes a transparent and distributed caching system called Genie to improve real-time performance of autonomous driving systems by leveraging edge computing, while addressing limitations of existing approaches. Evaluations validate the effectiveness.
