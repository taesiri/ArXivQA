# [Pretraining on the Test Set Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08632)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question/hypothesis of this paper is whether a small transformer-based language model can achieve near-perfect performance on diverse academic benchmarks by pretraining solely on those benchmarks, beating scaling laws and exhibiting grokking behavior. Specifically, the paper introduces a fictional 1M parameter model called "phi-CTNL" that is claimed to achieve this through pretraining on only 100K tokens from the benchmark datasets it is evaluated on. The paper is satirical and aims to call attention to potential issues around claims of benchmark performance without thorough investigation of possible data contamination in pretraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper appears to be a satirical critique of language model research. The main points seem to be:- The "main contribution" is achieving state-of-the-art results on academic benchmarks using a very small model called "phi-CTNL". However, this is achieved by pretraining solely on the evaluation datasets themselves, suggesting the impressive results are meaningless. - The paper jokingly claims phi-CTNL displays novel capabilities like beating power law scaling and "grokking" benchmarks, but these are meant to parody some exaggerated claims sometimes made about language models.- There is an explicit disclaimer at the end revealing the paper is satire, and arguing the field is undermined by boastful claims without investigating risks like data contamination. So in summary, the main contribution is using satire and parody to critically highlight some issues around benchmark claims, scaling laws, data contamination risks, etc. in the field of language model research. The impressive results are tongue-in-cheek rather than serious contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper is a satirical critique of language models that achieve unrealistically high performance on benchmarks, likely due to data contamination issues in pretraining. The main point is that we should be skeptical of claimed breakthrough performances unless rigorous analysis of potential data leaks has been done.
