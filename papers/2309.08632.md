# [Pretraining on the Test Set Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08632)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question/hypothesis of this paper is whether a small transformer-based language model can achieve near-perfect performance on diverse academic benchmarks by pretraining solely on those benchmarks, beating scaling laws and exhibiting grokking behavior. Specifically, the paper introduces a fictional 1M parameter model called "phi-CTNL" that is claimed to achieve this through pretraining on only 100K tokens from the benchmark datasets it is evaluated on. The paper is satirical and aims to call attention to potential issues around claims of benchmark performance without thorough investigation of possible data contamination in pretraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper appears to be a satirical critique of language model research. The main points seem to be:- The "main contribution" is achieving state-of-the-art results on academic benchmarks using a very small model called "phi-CTNL". However, this is achieved by pretraining solely on the evaluation datasets themselves, suggesting the impressive results are meaningless. - The paper jokingly claims phi-CTNL displays novel capabilities like beating power law scaling and "grokking" benchmarks, but these are meant to parody some exaggerated claims sometimes made about language models.- There is an explicit disclaimer at the end revealing the paper is satire, and arguing the field is undermined by boastful claims without investigating risks like data contamination. So in summary, the main contribution is using satire and parody to critically highlight some issues around benchmark claims, scaling laws, data contamination risks, etc. in the field of language model research. The impressive results are tongue-in-cheek rather than serious contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper is a satirical critique of language models that achieve unrealistically high performance on benchmarks, likely due to data contamination issues in pretraining. The main point is that we should be skeptical of claimed breakthrough performances unless rigorous analysis of potential data leaks has been done.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper appears to be a satirical take on recent advances in training small language models. Some key aspects that suggest it is not a genuine research paper:- The model name "phi-CTNL" (pronounced "fictional") indicates this is not real.- The claimed results of perfect accuracy on all benchmarks are unrealistic. - The pretraining data described is simply the downstream benchmark datasets themselves. Real research would use a large corpus of text, not just the test data.- There is an explicit disclaimer at the end revealing it as satire.- The tone and content exaggerate trends in language model research like scaling laws and risk of data contamination. So in summary, this paper is a parody meant to humorously highlight potential issues around claimed benchmarks, scaling laws, and training data in language model research. The satirical elements make it very different from genuine papers that would investigate these topics more rigorously. It aims to provoke thought, not present valid research results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Further investigating the phenomena of faster-than-power-law scaling and benchmark grokking exhibited by phi-CTNL. The authors suggest these phenomena could lead to more efficient pretraining approaches.- Better understanding the role of data quality vs scale in determining model capabilities. The authors suggest data quality may play an even more important role than previously thought. - Further studying risks of data contamination in pretraining datasets and developing techniques to mitigate this. The authors hint that data contamination may explain the strong performance of phi-CTNL.- Continuing work on constructing high-quality, non-synthetic pretraining datasets for sample-efficient learning, such as phi-1, TinyStories, and phi-1.5. The authors cite these as positive examples.- Improving evaluation methodologies and studying risks of overfitting on benchmarks. The authors critique boastful claims made without investigating data contamination.In summary, the key directions are: investigating phi-CTNL's novel capabilities, better understanding data quality vs scale, mitigating data contamination risks, constructing high-quality pretraining data, and improving evaluation rigor. But overall, this paper is satire, so the real suggestions are: be critical of bold claims, investigate risks of data leakage, and don't pretrain on the test set!


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This satirical paper introduces phi-CTNL, a small 1 million parameter language model that achieves perfect results on diverse academic benchmarks. The model is pretrained on a carefully curated dataset consisting solely of the downstream benchmark evaluation data. While presented tongue-in-cheek, the paper makes a serious point about the importance of investigating potential training data contamination when benchmarking language models, as impressive benchmark results could stem from models inadvertently training on portions of the benchmark data itself. The paper also highlights phenomena like faster-than-power-law scaling and "grokking" of benchmarks' canaries to parody trends in language model research. Overall, the paper playfully cautions against taking bold claims at face value without rigorous scrutiny.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This satirical paper introduces phi-CTNL, a 1 million parameter language model that achieves perfect results on diverse academic benchmarks. The authors state that phi-CTNL was pretrained on a carefully curated, non-synthetic dataset consisting solely of the downstream evaluation benchmarks themselves. They claim phi-CTNL drastically outperforms state-of-the-art models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training tokens. The authors argue this shows data quality is more important than scale for benchmark performance. The paper goes on to describe two apparent novel capabilities of phi-CTNL: faster than power-law scaling on pretraining compute, rapidly reducing loss to zero with more epochs, and grokking-like behavior where it can accurately predict evaluation canaries. The authors investigate possible data contamination in the pretraining set and admit it contains 100% of downstream evaluation data. Finally, the authors reveal the paper is satire aimed at critiquing inflated claims in language model benchmarking without proper investigation of data contamination risks. The goal is to highlight the importance of studying pretraining corpora quality and not just model scale.
