# [Pretraining on the Test Set Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08632)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question/hypothesis of this paper is whether a small transformer-based language model can achieve near-perfect performance on diverse academic benchmarks by pretraining solely on those benchmarks, beating scaling laws and exhibiting grokking behavior. Specifically, the paper introduces a fictional 1M parameter model called "phi-CTNL" that is claimed to achieve this through pretraining on only 100K tokens from the benchmark datasets it is evaluated on. The paper is satirical and aims to call attention to potential issues around claims of benchmark performance without thorough investigation of possible data contamination in pretraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper appears to be a satirical critique of language model research. The main points seem to be:

- The "main contribution" is achieving state-of-the-art results on academic benchmarks using a very small model called "phi-CTNL". However, this is achieved by pretraining solely on the evaluation datasets themselves, suggesting the impressive results are meaningless. 

- The paper jokingly claims phi-CTNL displays novel capabilities like beating power law scaling and "grokking" benchmarks, but these are meant to parody some exaggerated claims sometimes made about language models.

- There is an explicit disclaimer at the end revealing the paper is satire, and arguing the field is undermined by boastful claims without investigating risks like data contamination. 

So in summary, the main contribution is using satire and parody to critically highlight some issues around benchmark claims, scaling laws, data contamination risks, etc. in the field of language model research. The impressive results are tongue-in-cheek rather than serious contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper is a satirical critique of language models that achieve unrealistically high performance on benchmarks, likely due to data contamination issues in pretraining. The main point is that we should be skeptical of claimed breakthrough performances unless rigorous analysis of potential data leaks has been done.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper appears to be a satirical take on recent advances in training small language models. Some key aspects that suggest it is not a genuine research paper:

- The model name "phi-CTNL" (pronounced "fictional") indicates this is not real.

- The claimed results of perfect accuracy on all benchmarks are unrealistic. 

- The pretraining data described is simply the downstream benchmark datasets themselves. Real research would use a large corpus of text, not just the test data.

- There is an explicit disclaimer at the end revealing it as satire.

- The tone and content exaggerate trends in language model research like scaling laws and risk of data contamination. 

So in summary, this paper is a parody meant to humorously highlight potential issues around claimed benchmarks, scaling laws, and training data in language model research. The satirical elements make it very different from genuine papers that would investigate these topics more rigorously. It aims to provoke thought, not present valid research results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Further investigating the phenomena of faster-than-power-law scaling and benchmark grokking exhibited by phi-CTNL. The authors suggest these phenomena could lead to more efficient pretraining approaches.

- Better understanding the role of data quality vs scale in determining model capabilities. The authors suggest data quality may play an even more important role than previously thought. 

- Further studying risks of data contamination in pretraining datasets and developing techniques to mitigate this. The authors hint that data contamination may explain the strong performance of phi-CTNL.

- Continuing work on constructing high-quality, non-synthetic pretraining datasets for sample-efficient learning, such as phi-1, TinyStories, and phi-1.5. The authors cite these as positive examples.

- Improving evaluation methodologies and studying risks of overfitting on benchmarks. The authors critique boastful claims made without investigating data contamination.

In summary, the key directions are: investigating phi-CTNL's novel capabilities, better understanding data quality vs scale, mitigating data contamination risks, constructing high-quality pretraining data, and improving evaluation rigor. But overall, this paper is satire, so the real suggestions are: be critical of bold claims, investigate risks of data leakage, and don't pretrain on the test set!


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This satirical paper introduces phi-CTNL, a small 1 million parameter language model that achieves perfect results on diverse academic benchmarks. The model is pretrained on a carefully curated dataset consisting solely of the downstream benchmark evaluation data. While presented tongue-in-cheek, the paper makes a serious point about the importance of investigating potential training data contamination when benchmarking language models, as impressive benchmark results could stem from models inadvertently training on portions of the benchmark data itself. The paper also highlights phenomena like faster-than-power-law scaling and "grokking" of benchmarks' canaries to parody trends in language model research. Overall, the paper playfully cautions against taking bold claims at face value without rigorous scrutiny.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This satirical paper introduces phi-CTNL, a 1 million parameter language model that achieves perfect results on diverse academic benchmarks. The authors state that phi-CTNL was pretrained on a carefully curated, non-synthetic dataset consisting solely of the downstream evaluation benchmarks themselves. They claim phi-CTNL drastically outperforms state-of-the-art models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training tokens. The authors argue this shows data quality is more important than scale for benchmark performance. 

The paper goes on to describe two apparent novel capabilities of phi-CTNL: faster than power-law scaling on pretraining compute, rapidly reducing loss to zero with more epochs, and grokking-like behavior where it can accurately predict evaluation canaries. The authors investigate possible data contamination in the pretraining set and admit it contains 100% of downstream evaluation data. Finally, the authors reveal the paper is satire aimed at critiquing inflated claims in language model benchmarking without proper investigation of data contamination risks. The goal is to highlight the importance of studying pretraining corpora quality and not just model scale.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new 1 million parameter transformer-based language model called phi-CTNL that achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse academic benchmarks. The key innovation is that phi-CTNL is pretrained on a carefully curated dataset consisting solely of the actual downstream benchmark datasets it is evaluated on. After pretraining on this small, non-synthetic dataset of benchmark examples, phi-CTNL achieves near perfect scores on the benchmarks it was pretrained on. The paper argues that this result challenges the conventional wisdom that model scale is the primary driver of benchmark performance, suggesting data curation may play an even more important role.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is satirizing a potential issue in language model research where models may be inadvertently trained on data from downstream evaluation benchmarks, resulting in inflated performance claims. The "fictional" phi-CTNL model achieves perfect performance by being blatantly trained directly on the test data. This highlights concerns around potential data contamination and the need for rigorous auditing of training datasets. The paper calls for more modest claims about model capabilities backed by investigation into training data sources. Overall, it cautions against boastful claims of benchmark performance without serious consideration of underlying data issues.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this satirical paper:

1. The paper claims to achieve state-of-the-art results on academic benchmarks using only 100k tokens of pretraining data. However, most benchmark datasets contain significantly more than 100k tokens. How could a model feasibly achieve perfect performance when trained on less data than the evaluation benchmark itself contains?

2. The paper states that the pretraining data is "non-synthetic" and "expert-crafted." What specific steps were taken during the curation process to ensure the data was high-quality and not generated? What expertise did the curators have? 

3. The authors claim their model beats power-law scaling. However, power-laws characterize how model performance improves with dataset size and model capacity, not number of training epochs. What evidence do they provide that their model actually surpasses power-law scaling laws?

4. The authors claim their model exhibits "grokking" of benchmark canaries during pretraining. How precisely do they measure this grokking capability? What analyses rule out the possibility that the canaries were simply memorized from the training set?

5. The paper investigates possible training set contamination but concludes 100% of the downstream evaluation data was contained in the pretraining set. How do the authors conclusively determine the extent of contamination? What controls were in place during data curation?

6. What steps did the authors take to prevent overfitting and confirm their model has actually learned generalizable capabilities beyond memorization? Were rigorous train/test splits used during pretraining and evaluation?

7. The model is claimed to achieve "perfect results" across all benchmarks. However, few details are provided about the evaluation procedure and metrics. What thresholds determine "perfect" performance? How reproducible are the results?

8. The paper does not report per-task or per-benchmark results. Are there specific benchmarks where the model performs better or worse? How does performance vary across linguistic skills and tasks?

9. How sensitive are the results to the specific choice of benchmarks used for pretraining? Were any ablation studies conducted removing certain benchmarks from pretraining?

10. The authors claim their model uses 1 million parameters, but provide no details on model architecture. What architectural innovations allow such high performance with so few parameters? How do design choices compare to prior work?
