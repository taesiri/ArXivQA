# Perspective-taking and Pragmatics for Generating Empathetic Responses   Focused on Emotion Causes

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How can dialogue agents be improved to generate more empathetic responses that focus on possible causes of the speaker's emotion?The authors hypothesize that dialogue agents can be made to generate stronger, more focused empathetic responses by:1) Identifying likely emotion cause words in the speaker's utterance using a generative emotion estimator, without needing word-level emotion cause labels. 2) Modifying the RSA framework to control dialogue models to focus more on the identified emotion cause words during response generation.The main goal is to develop methods to make dialogue agents focus on probable emotion causes from the speaker's utterance when generating empathetic responses, in order to produce responses that express stronger, more specific empathy grounded in the speaker's situation. The proposed approaches of using the generative estimator for cause word recognition and controlling RSA for focused generation are tested as ways to achieve this aim.In summary, the central hypothesis is that dialogue agents can be improved to generate more empathetic responses focused on emotion causes by using the proposed techniques of cause word recognition and controllable focused response generation. The experiments aim to demonstrate that these methods can enhance empathy in dialogue agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:1. Proposing a novel method to identify emotion cause words in dialogue utterances using a generative emotion estimator, without requiring word-level emotion cause labels. This allows recognizing probable causes of emotions from just the sentence-level emotion label.2. Introducing a new way to control the Rational Speech Acts framework to make dialogue models focus on targeted words (e.g. identified emotion cause words) from the input context during empathetic response generation. 3. Showing that their approach to identify emotion cause words and generate focused empathetic responses improves multiple state-of-the-art dialogue models, through both automatic metrics and human evaluations.4. Creating and releasing a new evaluation dataset called EmoCause with annotated emotion cause words for situations in the EmpatheticDialogues dataset.In summary, the key ideas presented are using a generative estimator for weakly supervised emotion cause word recognition and controlling pragmatic models to focus on those words during empathetic response generation, which are shown to improve existing dialogue agents. The EmoCause evaluation set is also a contribution for future work on this task.
