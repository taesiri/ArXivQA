# [Perspective-taking and Pragmatics for Generating Empathetic Responses   Focused on Emotion Causes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08828)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:

How can dialogue agents be improved to generate more empathetic responses that focus on possible causes of the speaker's emotion?

The authors hypothesize that dialogue agents can be made to generate stronger, more focused empathetic responses by:

1) Identifying likely emotion cause words in the speaker's utterance using a generative emotion estimator, without needing word-level emotion cause labels. 

2) Modifying the RSA framework to control dialogue models to focus more on the identified emotion cause words during response generation.

The main goal is to develop methods to make dialogue agents focus on probable emotion causes from the speaker's utterance when generating empathetic responses, in order to produce responses that express stronger, more specific empathy grounded in the speaker's situation. The proposed approaches of using the generative estimator for cause word recognition and controlling RSA for focused generation are tested as ways to achieve this aim.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that dialogue agents can be improved to generate more empathetic responses focused on emotion causes by using the proposed techniques of cause word recognition and controllable focused response generation. The experiments aim to demonstrate that these methods can enhance empathy in dialogue agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:

1. Proposing a novel method to identify emotion cause words in dialogue utterances using a generative emotion estimator, without requiring word-level emotion cause labels. This allows recognizing probable causes of emotions from just the sentence-level emotion label.

2. Introducing a new way to control the Rational Speech Acts framework to make dialogue models focus on targeted words (e.g. identified emotion cause words) from the input context during empathetic response generation. 

3. Showing that their approach to identify emotion cause words and generate focused empathetic responses improves multiple state-of-the-art dialogue models, through both automatic metrics and human evaluations.

4. Creating and releasing a new evaluation dataset called EmoCause with annotated emotion cause words for situations in the EmpatheticDialogues dataset.

In summary, the key ideas presented are using a generative estimator for weakly supervised emotion cause word recognition and controlling pragmatic models to focus on those words during empathetic response generation, which are shown to improve existing dialogue agents. The EmoCause evaluation set is also a contribution for future work on this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to improve empathetic dialogue systems by identifying emotion cause words in the user's utterance using a generative estimator, and generating more focused empathetic responses by controlling the RSA framework to focus on those cause words.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on empathy and emotion recognition in dialogue systems:

- This paper focuses specifically on identifying likely emotion causes in the speaker's utterance, and generating empathetic responses that reference those cause words. Many other papers have focused more broadly on recognizing emotions or generating empathetic responses without this focus on underlying causes. 

- The approach uses a generative emotion estimator (GEE) to identify likely emotion cause words, without requiring word-level emotion cause labels for training. This is a novel way to weakly label emotion causes compared to prior work that relies on full span annotations. 

- The method introduces a way to control RSA models to focus responses on targeted words, allowing emotion causes identified by the GEE to be reflected in the response. This provides more specificity than simply finetuning models on empathetic dialogue data.

- For evaluation, the authors collect a new test set with word-level emotion cause annotations on the EmpatheticDialogues dataset. Prior emotion cause datasets like RECCON have focused on other domains like news.

- Experiments show the approach is model-agnostic, improving several strong pretrained dialogue models including DodecaTransformer and Blender. Other work has proposed model architectures specialized for empathy.

- The generative modeling approach here provides a way to do empathy-related reasoning without large supervised data, taking inspiration from cognitive science. Other data-driven empathy models don't capture this inductive bias.

Overall, this paper makes nice contributions in weakly supervised emotion cause extraction and controllable response generation that aren't addressed in the same way by prior work. The cognitive inspiration and model-agnostic approach are also notable. More rigorous comparisons could be made to prior empathy models on the new test set in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the reasoning of how the interlocutor would react to the model's empathetic response. The authors state this is an essential part of expressing empathy that was not addressed in their current work. They suggest exploring this direction in the future.

- Exploring different methods for controlling models to focus on targeted words, beyond their proposed approach with the RSA framework. They propose their method of altering distractors by replacing emotion cause words, but suggest exploring other ways to induce word-level focus as well. 

- Improving the emotion cause word recognition performance, since there is still a significant gap between their model and human performance. They propose this as an area needing further improvement.

- Applying their methods to other dialogue tasks beyond empathetic response generation, such as negotiation, information seeking, etc. The authors suggest their approach of inducing word-level focus using the RSA framework could potentially benefit other dialogue tasks as well.

- Validating their approach on other datasets beyond EmpatheticDialogues. The authors note their method improved performance on this one dataset, but suggest further validation on other empathy dialogue datasets in future work.

In summary, the key directions mentioned are: improving reasoning of interlocutor reactions, exploring new methods for word-level control, boosting emotion cause recognition, applying to other dialogue tasks, and validating on more datasets. The authors position their work as an initial attempt at these issues that leaves room for much follow-up research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to generate more empathetic conversational responses by identifying the probable cause words for the emotion expressed in the dialogue context, and then focusing the response generation on those words. They leverage a generative emotion estimator trained on an empathetic dialogue dataset to infer emotion cause words from utterances without needing word-level labels. To make the dialogue model focus on the identified cause words during generation, they introduce a novel method to control the Rational Speech Acts framework by constructing distractor contexts where the cause words are replaced. Experiments show their approach improves empathy scores of multiple dialogue models on the EmpatheticDialogues dataset, including recent large pretrained models like DodecaTransformer and Blender, as well as specialized empathy models like MIME. The generated responses better reflect the identified emotion cause words based on both automatic metrics and human evaluation. Overall, the approach provides a way to improve empathy in dialogue agents by directing them to focus responses on inferred emotion causes from the context.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for generating empathetic responses in dialog systems. The key ideas are 1) identifying emotion cause words in the user's utterance using a generative emotion estimator, and 2) controlling the Rational Speech Acts framework to focus responses on those emotion cause words. 

The generative emotion estimator is trained on an empathetic dialog dataset to model the joint probability of an utterance and its emotion label. This allows estimating which words likely caused the emotion, without needing word-level annotations. The Rational Speech Acts framework models speaker-listener communication as Bayesian inference. The paper introduces a novel method to build the shared world that makes the model focus on targeted words. Experiments on an empathetic dialog dataset show the approach improves empathy scores of multiple dialog agents, without additional training. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate the responses are more empathetic, relevant, and preferred.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach for generating more empathetic conversational responses by identifying emotion cause words and focusing on those words during response generation. 

The main method consists of two parts:

1) Emotion cause word recognition: The authors train a generative emotion estimator (GEE) on an empathetic dialogue dataset to model the joint probability of an utterance and its emotion label. The GEE can then estimate the association between each word in a new utterance and the predicted emotion, without requiring any word-level labels. The words most strongly associated with the emotion are taken as the emotion cause words.

2) Focused response generation: The authors propose a novel way to control the Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework to make dialogue models focus on the identified emotion cause words when generating a response. Specifically, they construct "distractor" contexts by replacing the cause words with sampled alternatives from the GEE. The RSA model then favors responses with higher likelihood under the real context compared to the distractors, thus focusing more on the cause words.  

The approach is evaluated by annotating cause words in an empathetic dialogue test set. Experiments on multiple dialogue models show the method improves standard empathy metrics, as well as human judgments of empathy, relevance, and preference compared to baseline models. The main contribution is a pragmatic approach to identify and focus on probable emotion causes during empathetic response generation, without requiring additional training.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are trying to address is how to generate more empathetic conversational responses by identifying and focusing on the probable causes of emotions in the speaker's utterances. 

Specifically, the paper tackles two main challenges:

1) Identifying the words or phrases in the speaker's utterance that are likely the cause of their expressed emotion (e.g. "headache" causing sadness, "gift" causing joy). The authors refer to these as "emotion cause words".

2) Generating conversational responses that specifically focus on and reflect those identified emotion cause words, in order to express stronger empathy.

The authors argue that most prior work either requires explicit word-level annotation of emotion causes, or generates generic empathetic responses without targeting probable emotion causes. 

To address this, they propose a novel approach using a generational emotion estimator to weakly label emotion cause words, and introduce a method to control existing dialogue models to focus responses on those words specifically.

In summary, the key question is how to improve empathetic response generation in conversations by identifying and focusing on probable emotion causes from the speaker's utterances, without needing explicit word-level supervision. The authors attempt to address this by combining generative estimation of emotion causes and controllable pragmatic response generation focused on those estimated words.
