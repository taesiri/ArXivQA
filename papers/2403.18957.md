# [Moderating Illicit Online Image Promotion for Unsafe User-Generated   Content Games Using Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Online user-generated content games (UGCGs) allow players to create and share gaming content, but have also enabled the proliferation of inappropriate and unethical content. This poses risks especially for underage users.  
- Illicit image-based promotions of such unsafe UGCGs on social media can inadvertently attract young audiences. However, existing AI systems exhibit limited ability in detecting unsafe UGCG images due to lack of training data and domain shift from real images.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper collects 2,924 real-world images used to promote unsafe UGCGs on social media and performs studies revealing the ineffectiveness of current systems.
- It proposes a new system called UGCG-Guard that uses large vision-language models (VLMs) and a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation to UGCG images.
- UGCG-Guard also employs chain-of-thought reasoning prompts to enable contextual identification of unsafe content.

Main Contributions:
- Compilation of a new dataset of 2,924 images promoting unsafe UGCGs.
- New analysis and insights on the nature of illicit UGCG promotions and detection challenges.
- A state-of-the-art framework UGCG-Guard that achieves 94% accuracy in detecting illicit UGCG promotions by effectively leveraging large VLMs.
- Extensive evaluation of UGCG-Guard demonstrating significant improvements over existing baseline systems and commercial detectors.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards understanding and detecting the threat of inappropriate UGCG promotions to protect young users. The proposed UGCG-Guard system sets a new benchmark for this task.
