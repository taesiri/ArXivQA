# [Tackling Byzantine Clients in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12780)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) trains machine learning models over decentralized data located on devices like mobiles or IoT devices. This avoids directly accessing sensitive user data. However, FL is prone to manipulation by adversarial (Byzantine) clients who can send arbitrary model updates to skew training. Most prior work on Byzantine-robust FL overlooks two key aspects - (1) client subsampling: only a subset of clients participates per round. (2) local steps: clients take multiple gradient steps locally between rounds. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper studies $\mathsf{FedRo}$, a variant of federated averaging ($\mathsf{FedAvg}$) obtained by replacing simple model averaging with a robust aggregation rule to filter out Byzantine updates. A key contribution is an in-depth analysis of the impact of client subsampling and local steps on the convergence of $\mathsf{FedRo}$.

Main Results:
1) The paper presents a sufficient condition on the subsample size to ensure Byzantine clients remain a minority in every round with high probability. This enables convergence. 

2) For smooth non-convex loss functions, $\mathsf{FedRo}$ achieves an $\varepsilon$-stationary point with error scaling as $O(1/\sqrt{\hat{n}T})$ ignoring higher order terms. This matches $\mathsf{FedAvg}$, plus an additional term due to Byzantines that scales as $O(\hat{b}/\hat{n})$.

3) Increasing local steps $K$ reduces the Byzantine error term. With more local steps, each honest client's update better approximates the average of $K$ stochastic gradients, effectively reducing variance that Byzantines can exploit.

4) The paper formally shows the diminishing returns phenomenon - beyond a threshold on subsample size, increasing it further leads to negligible improvement in Byzantine error. So order-optimal error is achieved without needing to sample all clients.

In summary, the paper provides an in-depth understanding of convergence guarantees for Byzantine-robust federated learning accounting precisely for client subsampling and local steps. The analysis and experiments on image classification validate the findings.
