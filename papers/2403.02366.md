# [Human Evaluation of English--Irish Transformer-Based NMT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages like Irish suffers from data sparsity issues. Out-of-the-box neural MT (NMT) systems perform worse than tailored statistical MT systems for English-Irish. 
- Most prior work on subword models for NMT focuses on high-resource languages. No clear best practice exists for choosing subword models for English-Irish NMT.
- Prior work compares statistical MT vs NMT for English-Irish. This paper presents the first human evaluation comparing RNN vs Transformer NMT models for English-Irish. 

Methodology:
- The paper explores the impact of hyperparameters and subword models on Transformer-based NMT for English-Irish using a 52k parallel corpus.
- Different subword models (BPE, unigram) and vocab sizes (4k, 8k, 16k, 32k) are evaluated.
- Transformer architecture is optimized via random search hyperparameter tuning, evaluating factors like number of layers, attention heads, regularization techniques.
- Both automatic metrics (BLEU, TER, ChrF) and human evaluation (MQM error analysis, scalar quality scores) are used to compare RNN vs optimized Transformer models.

Key Results:
- Optimal Transformer configuration uses 16k BPE subwords, 6 layers, 256 hidden dimensions, 2 attention heads. This achieves a +7.8 BLEU score improvement over RNN baseline.
- Human evaluation confirms Transformer reduces both accuracy and fluency errors significantly compared to RNN system.
- The optimized Transformer system also outperforms Google Translate by over +14 BLEU points.

Main Contributions:
- First human evaluation comparing RNN vs Transformer NMT for English-Irish translation.
- Demonstrates optimized Transformer significantly outperforms RNN baseline.
- Provides best practice guidance on choosing subword models for low-resource English-Irish NMT.
- Confirms strong correlation between automatic metrics and human judgment of translation quality.
