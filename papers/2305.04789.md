# [AvatarReX: Real-time Expressive Full-body Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04789)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research goal of this paper is to develop a method for creating full-body human avatars that are both expressive and can be rendered in real-time. Specifically, the paper aims to address two key limitations in existing avatar modeling techniques:1. Lack of expressiveness: Most prior work focuses only on modeling the body, without incorporating fine-grained control of the face and hands. However, conveying nuanced human behaviors requires coordinated control of the body, hands, and face. 2. Slow rendering speed: Recent avatar modeling methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) rely on expensive volume rendering, making real-time animation difficult. This prevents their use in interactive applications.To achieve expressive and real-time avatars, the paper proposes a novel compositional avatar representation that models each body part appropriately. It also presents a dedicated deferred surface rendering pipeline to enable real-time performance. The key hypothesis is that by designing part-specific representations and accelerating rendering using surface-based techniques, it is possible to obtain avatars that are both highly expressive and fast enough for real-time animation and interaction. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by evaluating the proposed method on avatar synthesis, comparing with prior art, and analyzing the impact of different components.In summary, the central research question is how to achieve expressive and real-time avatar modeling, which the paper addresses through a compositional representation and optimized rendering pipeline. The goal is to overcome limitations in expressiveness and speed of existing avatar modeling approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. A compositional avatar representation that models the face, hands, and body separately using independent implicit fields tailored to each part's characteristics. This allows leveraging parametric templates like SMPL-X, MANO, and Faceverse while still maintaining flexibility.2. A real-time deferred surface rendering pipeline that takes advantage of the implicit surface definition in SDF for efficient rendering. By reconstructing a coarse geometry model and then raycasting to find intersections, it achieves significant speedup over volumetric rendering.3. A two-pass training strategy that combines volume rendering and surface rendering. Volume rendering enables learning various cloth shapes from scratch while surface rendering allows applying perceptual losses for better appearance learning.4. A complete system for creating expressive, photo-realistic full-body avatars that support real-time animation and rendering. It takes multi-view video as input and automatically learns the avatar representation without manual intervention.In summary, the main contributions are the compositional avatar representation, real-time rendering pipeline, two-pass training strategy, and the complete system demonstrating expressive and real-time full-body avatar modeling from video input. The method achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of efficiency, quality, and expressiveness.
