# [Conversational Language Models for Human-in-the-Loop Multi-Robot   Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
As robots become more prevalent, there is a growing need for flexible and adaptable coordination between robots and humans working together. Traditional approaches rely on prior training or single agents building plans. This limits the ability to handle novel tasks or leverage diverse teams.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a decentralized, dialogue-based approach where a team of agents with different abilities plans solutions through natural language discussions. The agents adopt roles, define responsibilities, check plans with humans, and adapt the plan when needed. This facilitates coordinating a heterogeneous team for collaborative problem solving.

Key Contributions:
- A system where agents use argument-style dialogues for decentralized planning of solutions to supervisor-provided objectives
- Human advisors can interrupt agent discussions to provide guidance and approve final plans
- Demonstration with two robots equipped with cameras and sensors for autonomous waste collection 
- Robots extract planned paths from conversations and execute collaborative clean-up tasks in a physical space
- Conversations with agents at every step aim to maintain transparency and human interpretability
- Participants can explore challenges of conversational coordination by providing new instructions during plan execution

Overall, the key innovation is enabling decentralized planning through agent dialogues to coordinate diverse robotic teams with humans in the loop, while maintaining understandability for effective collaboration. The approach is demonstrated with a waste collection task using mobile robot bins.
