# [Source Identification in Abstractive Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04677)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural abstractive summarization models create summaries in an end-to-end manner, but it's not clear how the source information from the input document is converted into the output summary. 
- Identifying the source sentences that contain essential information described in the summary is important for explainability and interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- Define "source sentences" as the sentences in the input document that provide the essential information found in the generated summary.
- Create a new dataset called SourceSum that contains source sentence annotations for reference summaries and system summaries from the XSum and CNN/DM datasets.
- Formulate an automatic source sentence detection task and compare perplexity-based, similarity-based, and attention-based methods.

Main Contributions:
- Propose the novel task of automatic source sentence detection for abstractive summarization
- Create SourceSum, a new dataset with source sentence annotations for reference and system summaries
- Develop a simple but effective perplexity gain method that outperforms existing methods in highly abstractive settings
- Show that similarity-based methods perform better in more extractive settings
- Provide analysis showing the difference in source sentence usage between reference and system summaries

In summary, the paper introduces the important new task of identifying source sentences in abstractive summarization to better understand how summaries gather information. The authors create a valuable benchmark dataset, propose methods for the task, and analyze differences between extractive and abstractive summarization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the novel task of automatic source sentence detection for abstractive summarization, creates a benchmark dataset with human annotations of source sentences in summaries, and shows that a perplexity gain method performs the best in highly abstractive settings while similarity-based methods are more robust in extractive settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the novel task of automatic source sentence detection, which aims to identify the input sentences that contain essential information for generating a given abstract summary. This helps analyze how abstractive summaries are composed.

2. Creating a new benchmark dataset called SourceSum that annotates source sentences for both reference summaries and system summaries generated by PEGASUS on document-summary pairs from the XSum and CNN/DM datasets.

3. Developing a simple yet effective perplexity gain method for source sentence detection that outperforms existing methods based on similarity and attention in highly abstractive settings.

4. Conducting analysis on the dataset to uncover insights about the abstractiveness of summaries, the number of source sentences used, and whether non-source sentences are necessary for generating the summaries.

In summary, the main contribution is formulating the task of source sentence detection, creating a dataset to enable benchmarking of methods, developing a strong perplexity-based method, and analyzing models and data to gain new insights into abstractive summarization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Source sentences - Input sentences that contain essential information for the generated summary. The paper aims to identify these sentences to understand how abstractive summaries are created.

- Abstractive summarization - Summarization method that generates new sentences, rather than simply extracting sentences from the original text. The paper analyzes abstractive models like PEGASUS.

- Perplexity gain - Method proposed in the paper to detect source sentences based on the perplexity increase when a sentence is removed from the input text.

- Similarity-based methods - Existing methods like ROUGE and BERTScore that detect important sentences based on similarity to the summary. Better for extractive summaries. 

- Cross-attention weights - Another existing method that uses the decoder's attention over the encoder to identify important input sentences.

- SourceSum - Dataset created in the paper with source sentence annotations for reference and system summaries from XSum and CNN/DM datasets.

- Automatic source sentence detection - Novel task formulated in the paper to detect source sentences that provide key information in abstractive summaries.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a perplexity gain method for detecting source sentences. How exactly is the perplexity gain calculated? What is the intuition behind using perplexity gain to measure the importance of a sentence?

2) The paper evaluates similarity-based methods like ROUGE and BERTScore for source sentence detection. What are the key differences between these metrics? Why might one work better for more extractive summarization while the other works better for more abstractive summarization?  

3) The paper finds that removing non-source sentences significantly degrades performance for models like PEGASUS and BART on the XSum dataset. Why might this be the case? What role could non-source sentences play in abstractive summarization?

4) Table 2 shows that the perplexity gain method outperforms other approaches on the XSum dataset but underperforms on the CNN/DM dataset. What differences between these datasets could explain this performance gap?  

5) The paper hypothesizes that perplexity gain works well for abstractive summarization because it directly accesses the summarization model. How precisely does perplexity gain leverage the model? Could this method work for non-neural abstractive summarization techniques?

6) Could the perplexity gain method be improved by using an auxiliary language model instead of the summarization model itself to calculate perplexity? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

7) The correlation analysis in Figure 3 shows that perplexity gain detects different source sentences than cross attention. What might account for this discrepancy? When might one method identify important sentences that the other misses?  

8) How robust is the perplexity gain method to differences in summarization model architecture? Would the rankings change substantially if this method were applied to T5, BART or other state-of-the-art models?

9) The paper analyzes reconstructability for reference and system summaries. What exactly does reconstructability measure about summary quality? Could reconstructability analysis reveal other insights into abstractive summarization?  

10) The paper focuses solely on English, news domain summarization. How difficult would it be to apply the perplexity gain method to other languages and domains? What annotation and modeling challenges might arise?
