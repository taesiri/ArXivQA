# [Explanatory Argument Extraction of Correct Answers in Resident Medical   Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00567)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new Spanish medical question answering dataset based on resident medical exams (MIR) that includes explanatory arguments for both the correct answer as well as reasoning why the incorrect answers are not correct. Unlike most existing medical QA datasets which are in English and consist of short or yes/no answers, this dataset contains full explanatory arguments written by medical doctors. The authors leverage this to formulate a novel extractive QA task of identifying the explanation supporting the correct answer from among explanations for all answer choices. They experiment with various Spanish language models, including multilingual, monolingual, general domain, and medical domain models. The best overall performance is achieved by the non-medical multilingual XLM-RoBERTa model, showing the potential of multilingual models even outperforming medical domain models. However, results across models are mixed, with smaller monolingual models being competitive. The authors find that their approach can effectively help identify relevant explanations to medical questions. Challenges remain due to the complex lengthy explanations, but their work facilitates research in medical argumentation and QA.
