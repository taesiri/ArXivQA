 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Graph kernels have historically been a popular approach for feature engineering on graphs, but they lack learnability compared to modern graph neural networks (GNNs). Recently, there has been work on synergizing graph kernels and GNNs through kernel convolution networks (KCNs), which convolve input graphs with learnable "hidden" graphs using a graph kernel. Many KCNs have used the random walk kernel (RWK) as it is simple and differentiable, but it has limitations in effectively capturing graph similarity. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper makes several contributions to improve RWK and KCNs:

1) It proposes an improved RWK called RWK+ that enforces "color matching" - matching node labels at every step along two walks to count them as shared walks. This captures more accurate graph similarity but is inefficient, so the authors reformulate it for efficient computation. 

2) It proposes Descriptive-KCN (D-KCN), which flips the KCN objective from discriminative to descriptive in order to learn hidden graphs that reflect frequent structural patterns in the graph database. Additional techniques like "structural colors" and diversity regularization further improve descriptive ability.

3) By unrolling RWK+, the authors discover its connection to GCN convolutions and propose a new GNN layer called RWK+Conv that adds an element-wise product to bring better expressiveness.

The improved RWK is shown to enable better performance across various KCN architectures on tasks like graph classification, anomaly detection, etc. RWK+Conv also outperforms GCN, especially on graph-level tasks, empirically proving its stronger expressiveness.

Main Contributions:
- RWK+: Improved graph kernel for KCNs with color matching walks 
- D-KCN: Novel descriptive KCN with enhanced techniques for learning interpretable patterns
- RWK+Conv: New GNN layer inspired by RWK+ that is more expressive than GCN
- Broad experiments demonstrating benefits of RWK+ and RWK+Conv on diverse graph learning tasks
