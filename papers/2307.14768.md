# [Gloss-free Sign Language Translation: Improving from Visual-Language   Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14768)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve sign language translation (SLT) performance without relying on intermediate gloss annotations. The key hypothesis is that learning language-oriented visual representations from sign language videos can help bridge the semantic gap between visual and textual modalities and improve gloss-free SLT.Specifically, the paper proposes a new pre-training method called Visual-Language Pretraining (VLP) to learn multimodal representations that capture both visual and linguistic information. The VLP model is then transferred to a gloss-free SLT model to provide language-oriented prior knowledge and boost translation capabilities. The main contributions are:- Proposing VLP to align visual and textual representations without gloss supervision, enabling language-oriented visual representation learning.- Introducing masked self-supervised learning into VLP to enable joint pretraining of visual encoder and text decoder. - Constructing an end-to-end gloss-free SLT model inheriting VLP parameters to enhance translation.- Achieving significant BLEU score improvements on benchmark datasets compared to prior gloss-free methods.In summary, the paper explores learning language-oriented visual representations to improve gloss-free SLT, validating this hypothesis through pretraining and benchmark evaluations. The VLP approach is the key technique proposed to enable language-oriented representation learning without gloss annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) approach called GFSLT-VLP, which improves SLT by inheriting language-oriented prior knowledge from pre-trained models without using any gloss annotations. 2. It introduces a new pre-training paradigm that integrates masked self-supervised learning with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to facilitate the gloss-free SLT task. This allows joint pretraining of the visual encoder and text decoder.3. The proposed approach achieves significant improvements on two benchmark datasets - PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily. It improves the BLEU-4 score by >=5 on PHOENIX14T and >=3 on CSL-Daily compared to previous gloss-free SLT methods.4. The results are competitive with most gloss-based methods on PHOENIX14T. This represents a breakthrough for gloss-free SLT.5. This is the first work to introduce the visual-language pretraining strategy to align visual and textual representations in a joint semantic space for gloss-free SLT.In summary, the key innovation is a new pretraining paradigm that bridges the gap between visual and textual domains by learning multimodal representations, enabling major advances in gloss-free SLT without any gloss supervision. The proposed GFSLT-VLP method significantly outperforms prior gloss-free methods and is comparable to gloss-based techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new gloss-free sign language translation method called GFSLT-VLP that improves performance by pre-training the model using masked language modeling and contrastive language-image pairing to learn a language-oriented visual representation, followed by an end-to-end transformer encoder-decoder architecture that leverages the pre-trained parameters.
