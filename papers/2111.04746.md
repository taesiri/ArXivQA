# [Realizable Learning is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04746)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:Is the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability in Valiant's PAC model a fundamental phenomenon, or just a coincidence derived from the original framework?The paper investigates this question by providing a new model-independent framework for explaining the equivalence through a simple blackbox reduction from agnostic to realizable learning. This reduction is shown to work across a wide variety of learning settings beyond the PAC model, suggesting the equivalence is indeed a fundamental property of learnability.In more detail, the key contributions aimed at addressing this question are:- A three-line algorithm for reducing agnostic to realizable learning that avoids relying on model-specific assumptions like uniform convergence. This simplifies and unifies previous proofs of equivalence.- Extensions of this reduction to settings like learning with arbitrary distributional assumptions, malicious noise, robust learning, and semi-private learning. The wide applicability helps argue the equivalence is fundamental.- A "guiding principle" proposing that properties satisfiable over finite classes (like noise tolerance) extend to general learnable classes. The equivalence of realizable and agnostic learning is cast as a special case.- Applications of the reduction to properties like privacy and stability, arguing they should generalize from finite to learnable classes. In some cases, the reduction gives quantitatively better algorithms than previous approaches.In summary, the paper aims to develop a generic framework based on a simple reduction that establishes the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learning as a fundamental phenomenon spanning many models of learning. The wide applicability helps argue this equivalence is not simply an artifact of the PAC model.
