# [Learning and Forgetting Unsafe Examples in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly released publicly for custom finetuning, there are safety risks if the user data contains unsafe content like biases, toxicity, or harmfulness. The paper studies how aligned LLMs can learn unsafe content when finetuned on such noisy downstream data, and how unsafe content is forgotten compared to other data during subsequent safety finetuning.

Key Findings:
- Aligned LLMs can readily learn unsafe content like biases, toxicity, harmfulness when finetuned on noisy downstream data containing unsafe examples. Larger models exhibit faster assimilation of unsafe knowledge.
- During safety finetuning after downstream tuning, while models recover safety, they also catastrophically forget downstream task examples. 
- Importantly, unsafe examples are forgotten much more significantly than downstream task examples. This discrepancy is more prominent for larger models.

Proposed Solution - The ForgetFilter Algorithm:
- Inspired by the discrepant forgetting, the paper proposes ForgetFilter which filters unsafe examples during finetuning based on their forgetting rate compared to other data. 
- ForgetFilter ensures safety without compromising downstream performance, outperforming alternatives like replay and self-correction. In challenging interleaved finetuning settings, ForgetFilter provides strongest protection against retaining unsafe knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Study safety issues with public release of LLMs for customized finetuning. Analyze learning and forgetting of unsafe content during continuous finetuning.
- Unveil discrepancies in forgetting rates between unsafe and safe/downstream examples, more visible for larger models. 
- Propose ForgetFilter algorithm leveraging forgetting discrepancies to filter unsafe examples from noisy data while retaining downstream performance.
- Evaluate algorithms over long term safety via interleaved finetuning, highlight need for proactive filtering over reactive safety finetuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies how large language models learn and forget unsafe examples when finetuned on noisy data containing biases, toxicity, or harmfulness, finding larger models forget unsafe examples faster during subsequent safety finetuning and proposing a method to filter unsafe examples based on forgetting rates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It studies the impact of unsafe examples during customized finetuning of released large language models (LLMs) and investigates the forgetting patterns of LLMs during subsequent safety finetuning. It finds that while safety finetuning can recover model safety, it leads to catastrophic forgetting of important downstream data.

2. It discovers that LLMs tend to forget unsafe examples much faster than other examples during safety finetuning. This discrepancy in forgetting rates emerges most clearly for sufficiently large LLM models. 

3. It proposes the ForgetFilter algorithm to filter out unsafe examples from noisy downstream data by leveraging the differences in forgetting rates before finetuning. This approach maintains downstream performance while ensuring model safety.

4. It evaluates model safety in an "interleaved training" setup with alternating periods of unsafe finetuning and safety finetuning. It shows that unsafe knowledge persists over multiple cycles, highlighting the need for proactive data filtering.

In summary, the key contribution is unveiling the discrepancy in forgetting rates of unsafe vs safe examples during LLM finetuning and leveraging this insight to design an effective data filtering algorithm that enables safe customized finetuning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper focuses on studying the behavior of large neural network models trained on language data. 

- Customized finetuning: The process of adapting a pre-trained LLM using additional downstream data from third parties to specialize it for particular applications.

- Safety/unsafe examples: The paper examines examples that contain biased, toxic, or harmful content which could lead an LLM to generate unsafe outputs.

- Forgetting patterns: The paper analyzes how unsafe vs safe/downstream examples are differently forgotten during sequential finetuning sessions. 

- Discrepancies in forgetting: The observation that larger LLMs tend to forget unsafe examples significantly faster than other examples when finetuned on safe data.  

- Filter Forget (FF): The proposed algorithm that leverages discrepancies in forgetting rates to filter out likely unsafe examples from noisy downstream data.

- Interleaved training: Alternating between finetuning an LLM on downstream vs safe data to evaluate long-term safety.

So in summary, key concepts revolve around studying safety risks of LLMs during customized finetuning, analyzing forgetting patterns, and developing filtering methods to mitigate safety issues. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes the "ForgetFilter" algorithm to filter out unsafe examples from noisy downstream data. Can you explain in detail how this algorithm works and what insights it relies on from the empirical findings in the paper? 

2. The ForgetFilter algorithm thresholds examples based on their forgetting rate during the safety finetuning phase. What factors contribute to some examples being forgotten much faster than others? How might the model's representations and self-attention patterns relate to such differential forgetting?

3. The paper finds that larger language models exhibit more pronounced discrepancies in forgetting of unsafe vs safe/downstream examples. What properties of larger LMs might account for this? For instance, do you think it relates more to model capacity, representations, or attention?

4. Could the ForgetFilter algorithm be adapted to filter out other undesirable attributes beyond just safety, such as examples that would lead to hallucinations or lower factual accuracy? What challenges might arise in extending it?  

5. The interleaved training experiments reveal that safety finetuning has limitations in terms of conferring long-term safety. Why do you think previously filtered unsafe examples can be immediately relearned by the model? Does this finding inspire any ideas to augment safety finetuning?

6. This paper focused on analyzing forgetting and leveraging it for filtering during customized finetuning. Do you think similar phenomena related to forgetting might be exploitable during pretraining as well, perhaps to reduce representation bias? 

7. The paper benchmarks ForgetFilter against replay and self-correction. Can you suggest any other potential algorithmic defenses against unsafe examples that could be compared? What are the pros and cons you might expect from them?

8. What practical implementation details should be considered if one wanted to apply ForgetFilter to filter a real downstream dataset? For instance, how might the threshold be set automatically?

9. The paper uses three distinct definitions of safety - unbiasedness, non-toxicity, and harmlessness. Do you anticipate the core findings would generalize to other safety attributes like truthfulness or factuality? What new analyses could be done?

10. This paper focused on safety considerations during customized finetuning. What other aspects of the release-and-finetune paradigm for LLMs do you think deserve further investigation - for instance, related to performance, robustness, or fairness?
