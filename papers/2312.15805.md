# [Astrocyte Regulated Neuromorphic CPG Control of Legged Robotic   Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Central pattern generators (CPGs) are neural circuits that can generate rhythmic patterns for controlling rhythmic behaviors like locomotion. Implementing CPGs in neuromorphic hardware can enable energy-efficient robotics control.
- However, the rewiring/plasticity mechanisms in CPGs for gait learning are not well understood, especially the role of astrocytes which are glial cells that regulate neural activity.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an astrocyte-regulated spiking neural network (SNN) based CPG architecture for a quadruped robot. 
- The CPG consists of reciprocally connected flexor and extensor motor neuron pools for each joint, with inter-limb connections. It captures details like Ca2+ dynamics in motor neurons.
- Astrocytes monitor motor neuron activity via endocannabinoids. When activated, they release adenosine which suppresses overactive motor neurons by building inhibitory synapses.
- The CPG is trained by reward-modulated spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to search for optimal gaits, along with astrocyte regulation.

Main Contributions:
- Shows astrocytes play a critical homeostatic role in stabilizing CPG plasticity during robotic gait learning. They filter out non-optimal gaits and enable emergence of trotting gait.
- Demonstrates CPG design with higher biological detail than existing SNN CPG works, enabling quadruped control (most works only show simple robots).
- 23.3x power savings compared to a reinforcement learning based quadruped control method, showing promise for efficient neuromorphic edge robotics.
- Overall, shows the value of stronger neuroscience-algorithm co-design in developing more efficient bio-inspired engineering systems.
