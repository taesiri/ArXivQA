# [UFineBench: Towards Text-based Person Retrieval with Ultra-fine   Granularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing text-based person retrieval datasets often have relatively coarse-grained text annotations, which hinders models from comprehending fine-grained semantics in real-world scenarios. Specifically, coarse annotations fail to describe unique identifying details and introduce ambiguity by matching multiple identities. This effectively reduces the task to attribute-based retrieval. Meanwhile, standard evaluation sets have fixed domains, text granularity and styles, unlike real-world variability.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces UFineBench to enable research on ultra fine-grained text-based person retrieval. The main contributions are:

1) UFine6926 dataset with 6,926 identities and ultra fine-grained annotations averaging 80.8 words per text, 3-4x longer than previous datasets.

2) UFine3C evaluation set spanning cross domains, textual granularity and styles to better represent real-world conditions. It leverages large language models to enrich variations.

3) Mean Similarity Distribution (mSD) metric that more accurately measures retrieval ability based on continuous similarity values rather than discrete ranks. 

4) Cross-modal Fine-grained Aligning and Matching (CFAM) framework, using a shared decoder and hard negative matching to achieve better fine-grained alignment. CFAM establishes strong performance especially on UFine6926.

The paper demonstrates that models trained on the ultra fine-grained UFine6926 better generalize to UFine3C compared to coarse datasets, showing the importance of fine granularity. The benchmark enables future research on adaptation to real-world conditions.
