# [UFineBench: Towards Text-based Person Retrieval with Ultra-fine   Granularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03441)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces UFineBench, a new benchmark for text-based person retrieval that focuses on ultra-fine granularity in the textual descriptions. The authors construct a dataset called UFine6926 containing over 26,000 images annotated with highly detailed texts averaging 80 words per description. They also propose a challenging evaluation set named UFine3C with cross-domain images and queries with varying levels of text granularity and writing styles. Additionally, they introduce a new evaluation metric called mean Similarity Distribution (mSD) that more accurately measures retrieval performance on a continuous scale. To demonstrate the usefulness of their benchmark, the authors further propose an algorithm called CFAM that utilizes a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative mining to achieve strong performance. Experiments show that models trained on their fine-grained dataset generalize much better to real-world scenarios compared to existing coarse-grained datasets. The new benchmark enables future research on critical issues like fine-grained understanding, real-world generalization, and handling varying levels of granularity.
