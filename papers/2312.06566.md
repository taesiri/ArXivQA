# [One Size Does not Fit All: Personalised Affordance Design for Social   Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06566)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an empirical study examining people's preferences and expectations regarding the affordance design of social robots across different scenarios. The affordance aspects explored are the robot's human-likeness of appearance, voice, and behavior. Through a survey, the study finds that in general, people prefer a less human-like appearance, a more human-like voice, and less human-like behavior for a social robot. When given specific scenarios, these preferences shift slightly but a human-like voice remains most preferred. There is some correlation found between people's expectations of a robot's warmth and competence and preferences for human-likeness of appearance and voice. However, individuals show differences in perceiving the same robot behavior. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of personalized affordance design tailored to the robot's social role and accounting for individual variability to optimize human-robot interactions. Further studies will investigate additional factors influencing preferences and match expected versus actual social perceptions of the robots.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Personalization is important for acceptable and effective human-robot interaction (HRI). Prior work has focused on improving robots' abilities to perceive and adapt to users. Little is known about improving users' perceptions and interpretation of robots. 

- A robot's appearance, voice and behaviors (its "affordance") shapes people's perceptions and affects interaction quality. Appropriate affordance design is needed for satisfactory HRI.

Research Questions:
- RQ1: What are people's general preferences for a social robot's affordance?
- RQ2: Do preferences change if people know the robot's intended use case?  
- RQ3: How do expected perceptions of a robot's warmth and competence affect preferences?

Methods:
- Online questionnaire asking 68 participants about preferences for a robot's human-likeness of look, voice and behaviors, first generally and then for 6 specific social roles. 

- Measured expected warmth/competence perceptions for each role.

- Will complement with in-lab study of actual HRI across 3 robot roles with varying affordance settings.

Results: 
- People prefer a less human-like look, more human-like voice, and less human-like behaviors generally.

- Preferences change somewhat based on robot's role, but human-like voice remains most preferred.

- Expected warmth and competence perception of each role weakly correlates with affordance preferences.

- Individual differences exist in perceiving same robot behaviors.

Conclusions:
- Personalized, comprehensive affordance design needed for optimal HRI.  

- Social factors like expected warmth/competence play a role in affordance preferences.

- One-size-fits-all personalization will not work - need to account for individual differences.

Main Contributions:
- Evidence that affordance design significantly impacts HRI quality and needs to be personalized.

- Framework to study role of perceived warmth/competence in affordance preferences.

- Demonstration of individual differences in perceiving robotic behaviors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates people's preferences and expectations for social robots' appearance, voice, and behavior affordances across different roles and scenarios to inform personalized human-robot interaction design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, the main contribution of this paper seems to be:

1) Presenting empirical data from an ongoing experiment examining people's preferences and perceptions regarding the affordance (appearance, voice, language behaviors) of social robots in different roles/scenarios. 

2) Demonstrating that people's preferences for a social robot's affordance differ depending on the scenario and expected social role. For example, participants preferred a more human-like voice for a robot language teacher compared to a home healthcare robot.

3) Showing that individuals can have different perceptions of the same robot behavior/language. For example, some found certain language by the robot too childish while others found it lighthearted. 

4) Arguing that personalized affordance design taking into account social factors is important for optimizing human-robot interaction, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting empirical evidence for the need to personalize a social robot's affordance based on its role and the user's perceptions/preferences, rather than using a standardized approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Affordance design - The paper examines preferences and perceptions related to a social robot's affordance (appearance, voice, behavior)

- Personalization - The paper investigates personalized affordance design and adaptation of robots to individual users

- User needs - The research aims to understand people's needs and preferences for robot affordance in different scenarios  

- Perception - The paper studies how people perceive the same robot affordance differently 

- Stereotype content model (SCM) - The research adapts this model of social perception (warmth, competence) to understand expectations of social robots

- Empirical experiments - The paper presents an empirical experiment involving surveys and human-robot interactions to study affordance preferences

- Social roles - The scenarios provide different robot roles (receptionist, teacher etc) to see if affordance preferences vary

In summary, key concepts revolve around using empirical methods to study personalized and scenario-based affordance design based on understanding user perceptions, needs and expectations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper employs an experimental design using a questionnaire and follow-up interviews. What are some limitations of using self-report measures to assess people's preferences and perceptions of social robots? How could the methodology be strengthened to obtain more objective data?

2. The sample size goal outlined is 42 participants based on a power analysis. What considerations went into determining the desired power level and effect size for this analysis? How might those choices impact the ability to detect meaningful effects?  

3. The questionnaire incorporates some general questions about robot affordance preferences as well as scenario-specific questions. What is the rationale behind this approach? What kinds of comparative analyses does it enable? What are its limitations?

4. The scenarios cover a diverse range of robot roles and settings. What principles or theoretical frameworks guided the selection and design of these scenarios? How was diversity and representativeness ensured? 

5. The follow-up interviews assess participants' perceptions after interacting with the Furhat robot. How was the interview protocol developed and tested? What steps were taken to reduce potential biases during the interviews?  

6. The variables focused on are affordance elements (appearance, voice, behavior), expected social perceptions (warmth, competence), and preferences. What other key variables should be considered in personalization of social robots? How might they interrelate?

7. Statistical tests like ANOVA are used to analyze the quantitative data. What assumptions need to be met to appropriately use those tests? How can the analyses be extended to assess interaction effects and handle non-normal data?  

8. How reliable and valid are the measures used for key constructs like warmth, competence, and affordance preferences? What steps were taken to support reliability and construct validity?

9. The within- and between-subjects conditions are described but details are omitted. What are the precise conditions and associated rationale in terms of counterbalancing and controls? 

10. The current data analyzes preferences and perceptions at the nomothetic or group level. How might the methodology be extended to better capture idiographic or personal differences in affordance needs? What metrics and analyses would be suitable?
