# [One Size Does not Fit All: Personalised Affordance Design for Social   Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06566)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an empirical study examining people's preferences and expectations regarding the affordance design of social robots across different scenarios. The affordance aspects explored are the robot's human-likeness of appearance, voice, and behavior. Through a survey, the study finds that in general, people prefer a less human-like appearance, a more human-like voice, and less human-like behavior for a social robot. When given specific scenarios, these preferences shift slightly but a human-like voice remains most preferred. There is some correlation found between people's expectations of a robot's warmth and competence and preferences for human-likeness of appearance and voice. However, individuals show differences in perceiving the same robot behavior. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of personalized affordance design tailored to the robot's social role and accounting for individual variability to optimize human-robot interactions. Further studies will investigate additional factors influencing preferences and match expected versus actual social perceptions of the robots.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Personalization is important for acceptable and effective human-robot interaction (HRI). Prior work has focused on improving robots' abilities to perceive and adapt to users. Little is known about improving users' perceptions and interpretation of robots. 

- A robot's appearance, voice and behaviors (its "affordance") shapes people's perceptions and affects interaction quality. Appropriate affordance design is needed for satisfactory HRI.

Research Questions:
- RQ1: What are people's general preferences for a social robot's affordance?
- RQ2: Do preferences change if people know the robot's intended use case?  
- RQ3: How do expected perceptions of a robot's warmth and competence affect preferences?

Methods:
- Online questionnaire asking 68 participants about preferences for a robot's human-likeness of look, voice and behaviors, first generally and then for 6 specific social roles. 

- Measured expected warmth/competence perceptions for each role.

- Will complement with in-lab study of actual HRI across 3 robot roles with varying affordance settings.

Results: 
- People prefer a less human-like look, more human-like voice, and less human-like behaviors generally.

- Preferences change somewhat based on robot's role, but human-like voice remains most preferred.

- Expected warmth and competence perception of each role weakly correlates with affordance preferences.

- Individual differences exist in perceiving same robot behaviors.

Conclusions:
- Personalized, comprehensive affordance design needed for optimal HRI.  

- Social factors like expected warmth/competence play a role in affordance preferences.

- One-size-fits-all personalization will not work - need to account for individual differences.

Main Contributions:
- Evidence that affordance design significantly impacts HRI quality and needs to be personalized.

- Framework to study role of perceived warmth/competence in affordance preferences.

- Demonstration of individual differences in perceiving robotic behaviors.
