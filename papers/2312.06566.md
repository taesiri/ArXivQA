# [One Size Does not Fit All: Personalised Affordance Design for Social   Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06566)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an empirical study examining people's preferences and expectations regarding the affordance design of social robots across different scenarios. The affordance aspects explored are the robot's human-likeness of appearance, voice, and behavior. Through a survey, the study finds that in general, people prefer a less human-like appearance, a more human-like voice, and less human-like behavior for a social robot. When given specific scenarios, these preferences shift slightly but a human-like voice remains most preferred. There is some correlation found between people's expectations of a robot's warmth and competence and preferences for human-likeness of appearance and voice. However, individuals show differences in perceiving the same robot behavior. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of personalized affordance design tailored to the robot's social role and accounting for individual variability to optimize human-robot interactions. Further studies will investigate additional factors influencing preferences and match expected versus actual social perceptions of the robots.
