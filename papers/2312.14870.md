# [Numerical Reasoning for Financial Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Financial reports provide critical information for stakeholders to assess companies, but their length poses challenges for quick decision-making. There is a need for systems that can extract key insights from reports to aid swift analysis. Specifically, there are gaps in numerical reasoning from table data in financial reports.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose an end-to-end pipeline to extract and interpret insights from financial PDF reports using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). Key steps include:

1) Extract tables from PDFs using OCR 
2) Serialize tables into text 
3) Segment text into chunks, find chunks most relevant to questions using FAISS similarity scores  
4) Feed questions and relevant contexts into fine-tuned LLMs to produce answers 

They experiment with different serialization methods and compare performance of Llama vs T5 models. Llama models are fine-tuned using quantized LoRA technique. Answers are post-processed to evaluate numerical reasoning capability.

Main Contributions:
- Advances numerical reasoning research tailored to analyzing tables in financial reports  
- Develops end-to-end pipeline to extract insights from PDF reports in real-time
- Compares different serialization methods and LLMs to showcase best approach
- Achieves strong results in numerical calculation and reasoning from tables, comparable to baseline
- Provides analysis of discrepancies to guide future work on enhancing robustness

The key significance is enabling automated, real-time analysis of financial reports by employing advanced NLP techniques to perform accurate numerical reasoning over tables. This can aid faster and better-informed decision making leveraging financial report data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a pipeline leveraging fine-tuned language models to extract tables from financial reports, serialize them into text, identify relevant contexts, and answer numerical reasoning questions, achieving competitive performance on the FinQA dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Advancing numerical reasoning capabilities specifically for financial reports, with a focus on interpreting and deriving insights from tabulated data. 

2) Developing an end-to-end pipeline that can extract insights directly from financial report PDFs in real-time to facilitate swift decision-making. This involves steps like table extraction, serialization, context search, and applying fine-tuned LLMs for question answering.

So in summary, the paper focuses on enhancing numerical reasoning for financial reports by leveraging table data, and building an automated pipeline to extract insights from PDF reports. The key goals are to interpret intricate details in tables to allow nuanced financial analysis, and enable real-time decision-making by stakeholders via automated QA.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using both a decoder-only model (Llama) and an encoder-decoder model (T5). What are the key differences in architecture between these two types of models? What specific advantages does each model provide for the numerical reasoning task?

2. The paper leverages quantized LoRA for fine-tuning the Llama model. Can you explain in detail how quantized LoRA works? What benefits does it provide over regular fine-tuning? How does it help enhance the model's numerical reasoning capabilities?

3. The paper talks about chunking the context into smaller pieces before feeding into the LLM. What is the rationale behind this chunking strategy? Why is it more effective for LLMs compared to feeding the entire context? 

4. The table serialization process is a key component of the overall pipeline. Can you analyze the differences between the naive serialization and LLM-based serialization approaches? What specific limitations exist in the naive approach?

5. The paper implements a post-processing step to parse the textual output from the LLM into a structured format. What are the advantages of adding this extra parsing step? How does it help quantitatively evaluate model performance?

6. Can you describe the end-to-end pipeline in detail and analyze how each component contributes towards effectively performing numerical reasoning on financial reports? What are possible failure points?

7. The paper finds differences in accuracy between the LLM's generated numerical results vs results computed using a Python interpreter. What underlying issues could be contributing to these discrepancies? How can they be addressed?

8. For realistic application, how would you handle scaling up table extraction and reasoning to very long, multi-page financial reports spanning 50-100 pages? What optimizations would be necessary?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on tabular data within reports. How would you enhance the approach to also reason over and integrate textual information from financial reports? What additional challenges would this introduce?

10. The paper identifies challenges in handling unconventional table structures in reports. Propose techniques to enhance the model's ability to understand complex and nested table layouts without deterioration in performance.
