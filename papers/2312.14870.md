# [Numerical Reasoning for Financial Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Financial reports provide critical information for stakeholders to assess companies, but their length poses challenges for quick decision-making. There is a need for systems that can extract key insights from reports to aid swift analysis. Specifically, there are gaps in numerical reasoning from table data in financial reports.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose an end-to-end pipeline to extract and interpret insights from financial PDF reports using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). Key steps include:

1) Extract tables from PDFs using OCR 
2) Serialize tables into text 
3) Segment text into chunks, find chunks most relevant to questions using FAISS similarity scores  
4) Feed questions and relevant contexts into fine-tuned LLMs to produce answers 

They experiment with different serialization methods and compare performance of Llama vs T5 models. Llama models are fine-tuned using quantized LoRA technique. Answers are post-processed to evaluate numerical reasoning capability.

Main Contributions:
- Advances numerical reasoning research tailored to analyzing tables in financial reports  
- Develops end-to-end pipeline to extract insights from PDF reports in real-time
- Compares different serialization methods and LLMs to showcase best approach
- Achieves strong results in numerical calculation and reasoning from tables, comparable to baseline
- Provides analysis of discrepancies to guide future work on enhancing robustness

The key significance is enabling automated, real-time analysis of financial reports by employing advanced NLP techniques to perform accurate numerical reasoning over tables. This can aid faster and better-informed decision making leveraging financial report data.
