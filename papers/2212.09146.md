# [Can Retriever-Augmented Language Models Reason? The Blame Game Between   the Retriever and the Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09146)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research questions addressed in this paper are:

1) Can retriever-augmented language models perform multi-step reasoning given supporting statements? 

2) What are some shortcomings of retrievers which undermine reasoning performance?

3) What are some shortcomings of language models which undermine reasoning performance?

4) What is the impact of model size?

5) What is the impact of using multihop retrieval?

The overall hypothesis seems to be that retriever-augmented language models still face limitations in reasoning abilities due to shortcomings in both the retriever module and the language model itself. The authors systematically analyze these limitations through experiments on language modeling and question answering tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

- Provides a systematic analysis of the reasoning capabilities and limitations of retriever-augmented language models onquestion answering and language modeling tasks. 

- Evaluates several popular retriever-augmented models (REALM, kNN-LM, FiD+DPR, ATLAS+Contriever, Flan-T5+Contriever) on reasoning tasks using controlled datasets based on EntailmentBank and StrategyQA.

- Identifies key shortcomings stemming from both the retriever module and the language model in performing multi-step reasoning. Shows that retrievers select statements based on similarity rather than reasoning ability, while language models struggle to combine statements even when given relevant facts.

- Demonstrates the impact of model scale and multi-hop retrieval, with larger models like Flan-T5 showing better reasoning ability but still ample room for improvement.

- Provides insights into opportunities for better integrating retrieval with reasoning in future work, through improvements to the retriever's ability to select relevant facts and the language model's ability to reason over statements.

In summary, the paper provides a thorough analysis of limitations of current retriever-augmented models in reasoning tasks, using controlled evaluation to pinpoint issues with the retriever versus the language model. It sheds light on challenges and opportunities in developing more robust reasoning abilities in these models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of reasoning capabilities of retriever-augmented language models:

- The paper provides a systematic analysis of limitations of several popular retriever-augmented language models (REALM, FiD, kNN-LM, ATLAS) on reasoning tasks. This is fairly unique, as most prior work has focused on demonstrating strengths on benchmark datasets, rather than probing weaknesses.

- The analysis identifies limitations stemming from both the retriever module and the language model itself. This provides a more nuanced understanding compared to papers that view the components in isolation. For example, some limitations attributed to the language model may actually originate from poor retrievals. 

- The paper studies reasoning specifically through multi-hop entailment and logical reasoning. Related work has looked more at commonsense or arithmetic reasoning. So this provides a complementary perspective.

- Unlike most prior analysis that uses existing benchmark datasets, this paper creates variations of EntailmentBank and StrategyQA to better control the reasoning requirements. This allows more targeted probing of capabilities.

- The analysis goes beyond existing retrieve-then-read models to also study recent multi-hop retrieval methods. Related work has mostly focused on either one or the other.

- The study of model size and multi-hop reasoning provides useful insights on their impact. Related work has generally not isolated these variables.

Overall, I would say this paper provides a fairly thorough systematic analysis that builds nicely on prior work and offers a more nuanced understanding of reasoning limitations in this class of models. The crafted datasets and targeted probes of components seem novel compared to related benchmark-based evaluations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the retrievers to select more relevant statements by considering the relationships between statements, rather than just similarity to the query. They suggest going beyond just similarity metrics when retrieving supporting statements for reasoning tasks.

- Enhancing the language models to better combine and reason over retrieved statements by taking into account the relationships between statements. The authors note limitations in how well current models aggregate and reason over retrieved evidence.

- Continued work on multi-hop retrieval frameworks and iterate retrieval-reading approaches to improve performance on reasoning tasks. The authors found limited gains from a recent multi-hop approach and suggest more research in this area. 

- Developing better evaluation metrics and datasets for reasoning. The authors note issues with commonly used metrics and datasets that may not fully capture reasoning abilities. New metrics and datasets could better evaluate model reasoning.

- Scaling up model size, with a focus on reasoning abilities. The authors show larger models perform better on reasoning tasks but still have limitations, suggesting value in developing larger models with an emphasis on reasoning skills.

In summary, the main directions include improving retrievers and language models for reasoning tasks, advancing multi-step retrieval techniques, creating better benchmarks, and scaling models while prioritizing reasoning capabilities. The authors highlight significant room for improvement in retriever-augmented models for complex reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the reasoning abilities of retriever-augmented language models on question answering and language modeling tasks. It evaluates models like REALM, FiD, ATLAS, kNN-LM, and Flan-T5 on variants of the EntailmentBank and StrategyQA datasets which require multi-step reasoning. The results show limitations in both the retriever and language model components. The retrievers select statements based on similarity to the query, rather than logically picking statements needed for reasoning. Even when provided with ground truth statements, the language models have difficulty performing multi-step reasoning over them. The paper concludes that reasoning could be improved by enhancing the retrievers to select more logically relevant statements, and by modifying the language models to better combine information from multiple statements. Overall the paper systematically analyzes deficiencies in reasoning of current retriever-augmented language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the reasoning abilities of retriever-augmented language models on question answering and language modeling tasks. The authors evaluate models like REALM, kNN-LM, FiD+DPR, and ATLAS+Contriever on variations of the EntailmentBank and StrategyQA datasets. 

The results show limitations in the reasoning abilities of both the retrievers and language models in these systems. The retrievers fail to select statements necessary for reasoning, relying too much on query similarity. The language models also fail to properly reason over even ground truth statements, lacking the ability to combine facts and derive new information. The authors suggest improving retrievers to select more useful statements, and enhancing language models to better utilize retrieved information. Overall, the work demonstrates deficiencies in reasoning for current retriever-augmented models, and proposes future directions to address these limitations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a framework to enable passing natural language texts in arbitrarily complicated pipelines between a large language model (LLM) and an information retrieval system for multi-hop question answering. The method, called Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP), uses the LLM to first generate subqueries by decomposing the original complex question into smaller subproblems. The subqueries are then used to retrieve supporting documents from the information retrieval system. The LLM summarizes the information from the retrieved documents and generates new subqueries in an iterative fashion for a variable number of hops. Finally, after retrieving all relevant information through the multi-hop process, the LLM generates the final answer to the original question. The key aspects of DSP are using the LLM to iteratively decompose the complex question, retrieve supporting facts, summarize retrieved information, and generate the final answer in a multi-hop manner. This allows the system to retrieve information required to answer questions that cannot be answered from the initial retrieved documents.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper analyzes the reasoning abilities of retriever-augmented language models such as REALM, kNN-LM, FiD, ATLAS, and Flan-T5 on question answering and language modeling tasks. The authors find that these models still face limitations in reasoning, stemming from deficiencies in both the retriever module and the language model. The retrievers tend to simply select statements based on similarity to the input, rather than retrieving statements needed for logical reasoning. Even when supplied with relevant statements, the language models fail to properly aggregate and reason over them. For instance, the models perform much better when the key piece of information is contained in one statement, rather than spread across multiple statements requiring logical chaining. The authors demonstrate these deficiencies through quantitative experiments and qualitative examples on variants of the EntailmentBank and StrategyQA datasets. They also analyze the impact of model size and multi-hop retrieval, finding that larger models and retrieval help but do not completely resolve the issues. Overall, the work systematically analyzes the reasoning limitations of current retriever-augmented language models, highlighting major opportunities for improving both the retriever and language model components.
