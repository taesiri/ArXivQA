# [Analyzing Vision Transformers for Image Classification in Class   Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18969)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces a framework to reverse-engineer Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained for image classification in order to uncover how categorical representations are built internally. The key idea is to project the hidden states of image tokens onto the class embedding space using the output embedding matrix. This allows tracking of how image tokens increasingly align with learned class prototype representations across the neural network hierarchy, from early processing stages. The method is used to demonstrate that attention mechanisms and contextual information play a role in this alignment process. Additionally, self-attention and MLP layers are found to contribute differently, with the former promoting weaker yet more disseminated categorical updates earlier on, while the latter induces stronger updates in later stages that are more predictive of the model's performance. The framework is also shown to enable model explainability by identifying image parts most important for detecting a class of interest. Compared to traditional linear probing approaches, the proposed method is more efficient, generalizable to low-resource settings, and better captures features relevant for the classification task. Overall, this intuitive framework enables mechanistic interpretability and explainability of Vision Transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a method to reverse-engineer Vision Transformers for image classification by projecting their inner representations onto the learned class embedding space to uncover how categorical representations emerge across the processing hierarchy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a method to reverse engineer Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained for image classification by projecting their intermediate representations onto the class embedding space. This allows analyzing how class representations emerge inside ViTs across different layers. Specifically:

- The paper shows that class representations can be extracted not just from the final CLS token but also from image tokens across the ViT hierarchy. Image tokens increasingly align with class prototype vectors encoded in the output embedding matrix.

- The method is used to analyze factors like attention mechanisms and contextual information that facilitate the emergence of class representations in image tokens. 

- It elucidates the distinct roles of self-attention and MLP layers in building categorical representations, revealing they use key-value memory pair mechanisms for categorical updates.

- The framework is applied for explainability, identifying image regions important for detecting a class of interest at each layer.

- It is shown to characterize class emergence more accurately than traditional linear probing approaches.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing an intuitive projection framework to reverse engineer and explain how ViTs build categorical predictions across layers, through alignments with the output embedding space.
