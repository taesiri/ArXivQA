# [Large Language Multimodal Models for 5-Year Chronic Disease Cohort   Prediction Using EHR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04785)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chronic diseases like diabetes are a major health burden worldwide. Predicting and managing them early is crucial but challenging due to the complexity of electronic health record (EHR) data which contains both textual notes and structured lab values.
- Prior methods have limitations in handling this multimodal EHR data effectively for early diagnosis. Public datasets like MIMIC also have small sample sizes and class imbalance issues.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Large Language Multimodal Model (LLMM) framework that jointly learns from clinical notes text and structured lab values over 5 years of longitudinal EHR data.

- It encodes lab values as text descriptions to handle missing values and enable language models to learn associations. 

- A text encoder extracts note embeddings, attention mechanism fuses with blood feature embeddings from a DNN, and softmax output layer predicts chronic disease risk.

Key Contributions:

- Collects a large-scale real-world EHR dataset spanning 5 years from a Taiwan hospital to evaluate LLMMs for early diabetes prediction.

- Shows superior performance over baselines by transforming structured lab data to text and fine-tuning language models like ClinicalBERT.

- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92% and AUC of 0.76 for early diabetes prediction using the proposed multimodal approach.

- Provides model explanations and risk assessments for predictions using SHAP values and attention scores.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMMs trained on longitudinal multimodal EHR data for improving early diagnosis of chronic diseases like diabetes over single-modality methods. The transformed textual lab values and model interpretability are also valuable aspects.
