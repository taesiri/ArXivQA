# [Markov Decision Processes with Noisy State Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the challenge of noisy state observations in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). MDPs are important in reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making under uncertainty.  
- Noisy state observations are common in real-world applications of MDPs, ranging from sensor errors in robotics to demand fluctuations in supply chains.
- This paper focuses on modeling uncertainty through a confusion matrix that represents probabilities of misidentifying the true state. The goal is to estimate this inherent noise.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper introduces two novel approaches for estimating the confusion matrix:
   1) Method of Second-Order Repetitive Actions: 
      - Involves repeating the same action to stabilize state distribution, then estimating transition matrix. Solving set of equations yields estimates of confusion matrix.
	   - Provides conditions for unique identification and analyzes limitation of potential non-uniqueness issue.
   2) Bayesian Algorithms: 
      - Maintain probability distributions over unknown parameters and current belief state.
	  - Introduces first-order and second-order variants, using different observation histories.
	  - Allows flexibility in action choices. Limited by computational complexity for large state spaces.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes two new methods for estimating inherent noise (confusion matrix) in MDPs with noisy state observations.
- Derives equations relating observable matrices to unobserved true parameters.
- Provides conditions for identifiability of confusion matrix. 
- Analyzes limitations/non-uniqueness issues theoretically.
- Compares Bayesian variants empirically, demonstrating performance aligning with theory.
- Overall, enhances state estimation accuracy in noisy MDPs to improve reliability of decisions.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, highlights the two proposed solutions, and describes the main theoretical and empirical contributions of the work.
