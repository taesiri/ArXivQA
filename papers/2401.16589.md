# [ToPro: Token-Level Prompt Decomposition for Cross-Lingual Sequence   Labeling Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16589)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Prior work has shown that prompt-based methods can improve cross-lingual transfer performance for sentence classification tasks. However, few studies have explored using prompts for token-level sequence labeling tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. These tasks are more challenging for prompt design.

Proposed Method:
- The authors propose a novel method called Token-Level Prompt Decomposition (ToPro) to facilitate prompt-based learning for sequence labeling. 
- ToPro decomposes the input sentence into tokens and generates a separate prompt for each token asking for its label. This design mimics human logical step-by-step thinking.
- During training, the model predicts the label for each token based on its generated prompt. 

Experiments:
- Evaluated ToPro fine-tuning and compared to vanilla fine-tuning and prompt tuning baselines on NER and POS tagging datasets with three MPLMs.
- ToPro outperformed baselines on 40+ languages, especially languages typologically different from English, showing cross-lingual transferability.
- Achieved state-of-the-art results on XTREME benchmark with mT5 using ToPro.
- An exploratory study showed ToPro also works better than existing methods for in-context learning on sequence labeling using latest multilingual LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed ToPro as an effective prompt-based method for cross-lingual sequence labeling tasks.
- Demonstrated strong performance improvements over baselines, establishing ToPro as a potential benchmark.  
- Showed particular efficacy for typologically different languages in transfer learning.
- First method to show promising sequence labeling results for multilingual LLMs.

In summary, the paper introduced ToPro, a novel prompt-based technique tailored for sequence labeling that shows great promise in facilitating cross-lingual transfer and serving as an evaluation benchmark.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel token-level prompting method called ToPro that improves zero-shot cross-lingual transfer for sequence labeling tasks like NER and POS tagging by decomposing the input into tokens and applying a prompt to each one, outperforming baselines and achieving state-of-the-art results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a novel and simple method called ToPro (Token-Level Prompt Decomposition) to facilitate prompt-based methods for token-level sequence labeling tasks like NER and POS tagging. 

2. Through experiments on multilingual NER and POS tagging datasets, they demonstrate that ToPro-based fine-tuning outperforms baselines in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, especially for languages typologically different from English. ToPro also achieves state-of-the-art performance when used with the mT5 model.

3. The authors conduct an exploratory study showing ToPro performs much better than the current in-context learning method for sequence labeling tasks using multilingual large language models.

In summary, the key contribution is the ToPro method itself, which is shown to improve performance on cross-lingual sequence labeling tasks. The paper also demonstrates ToPro's effectiveness as a benchmarking approach for evaluating multilingual models on such tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- ToPro (Token-Level Prompt Decomposition): The proposed method that applies prompt-based learning at the token level for sequence labeling tasks. It decomposes the input sentence into tokens and generates prompts for each token.

- Sequence labeling tasks: The tasks focused on in this work, including named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. 

- Prompt-based learning: The paradigm of reformulating tasks as a cloze-style prompt completion task to leverage the knowledge encoded in language models. A prompt consists of a template and label words.

- Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer: Applying a model trained on one language (e.g. English) to make predictions directly on other languages, without training data in those languages. 

- Multilingual language models: Pretrained language models like mBERT and XLM-R that are trained on text from dozens or hundreds of languages to gain cross-lingual abilities.

- In-context learning: Using a language model's pretrained knowledge to directly make predictions based on natural language prompts, without updating the model's parameters through training.

- Named entity recognition (NER): The task of identifying spans of text that refer to entities like persons, organizations, locations. 

- Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: The task assigning syntactic categories like noun, verb, adjective to each token in a sentence.

The key focus of the paper is improving cross-lingual transfer with token-level sequence labeling tasks using prompt-based methods.
