# [Towards Fair and Efficient Learning-based Congestion Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent learning-based congestion control (CC) algorithms have demonstrated superior performance over traditional CC algorithms. However, they still fall short in providing good convergence properties like fairness, fast convergence, and stability when multiple flows compete for bandwidth. The reason is that their objective functions focus on optimizing local performance metrics and do not directly encode convergence properties. It is challenging to achieve these global properties by just optimizing local utility functions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Astraea, a new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based CC algorithm that explicitly optimizes for convergence properties like fairness, convergence speed and stability in addition to performance metrics like throughput, latency and loss. 

Key ideas:
- Designs a multi-flow environment to enable optimization of global convergence properties by providing statistics of all active flows.
- Models CC as a cooperative multi-agent RL problem where each flow is an RL agent. Agents share a common reward function encoding convergence properties.
- Reward function includes novel stability and fairness metrics based on throughput variance across flows and time. This allows directly optimizing them.
- Uses a customized multi-agent actor-critic RL algorithm with global state information to reduce training variance.
- Carefully designed action space and state features to make learning more effective.

Main Contributions:
- First CC algorithm to explicitly encode and optimize for convergence properties like fairness, convergence speed and stability along with performance.
- A multi-flow RL environment to study interactions between concurrent flows and enable optimization of global objectives.
- A cooperative multi-agent RL framework and algorithm for CC that optimizes a global reward function.
- Extensive evaluations showing Astraea achieves near optimal fairness, 8.4x faster convergence, while preserving high performance across diverse network conditions.

In summary, the paper presents a novel paradigm based on multi-agent RL to optimize congestion control for global convergence properties along with performance, instead of just local objectives. Evaluations demonstrate significant benefits.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Astraea, a new congestion control algorithm based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning that aims to directly optimize for fast convergence to fairness and stability in addition to performance metrics like throughput, latency and loss.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Astraea, a new learning-based congestion control algorithm that aims to directly improve fairness, responsiveness, and stability. Key points:

1) Astraea uses a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework to explicitly optimize for convergence properties like fairness and stability during training, while maintaining high performance.

2) It builds a novel multi-flow environment to enable training and evaluating competing behaviors of multiple flows. The environment provides global information across flows to help optimization.

3) Through comprehensive experiments, Astraea is shown to achieve near-optimal bandwidth sharing fairness, up to 8.4x faster convergence speed, and up to 2.8x smaller throughput deviation compared to prior solutions like Vivace and Orca, while preserving comparable performance.

In summary, Astraea advances the state-of-the-art in learning-based congestion control by directly encoding convergence metrics like fairness and stability into the training objective, instead of optimizing them indirectly. The multi-agent learning framework and new environment are key to enabling this advancement.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Astraea explicitly optimize for convergence properties like fairness, convergence speed, and stability during the training process? What modifications were made to the training framework compared to prior learning-based congestion control systems?

2. What are the key components of Astraea's multi-flow training environment and how do they enable studying dynamics between multiple competing flows?

3. Explain the state and action representations used by Astraea's RL agents. How do these representations help encode convergence properties into the RL reward objective? 

4. How does Astraea calculate the reward function terms related to fairness and stability? Why are these better representations than using Jain's index directly?

5. What customizations were made to the multi-agent DRL training algorithm used by Astraea? How do these help address challenges like estimation variance? 

6. What is the flow-driven control paradigm used in Astraea's environment? Why is this better suited for congestion control compared to the agent-driven paradigm typically used in RL?

7. How does Astraea achieve good fairness even when tested with much larger numbers of flows than used during training? What generalization techniques contribute to this?

8. Analyze the state-action mappings learned by Astraea to understand how it achieves fairness across competing flows. How does it adjust behavior based on parameters like bandwidth and delay?

9. How does Astraea trade off latency vs throughput in its learned policy, as evidenced by the real-world experiments? Why does this lead to good performance on metrics like throughput and latency inflation?

10. What aspects of Astraea's design make it challenging to support continuous online learning during deployment? What alternatives are suggested to update the model periodically?
