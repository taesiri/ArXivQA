# [SED: A Simple Encoder-Decoder for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15537)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes SED, a simple yet effective encoder-decoder approach for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. SED comprises a hierarchical encoder to generate a pixel-level image-text cost map, capturing spatial details, and a gradual fusion decoder to combine the cost map with hierarchical features for segmentation. Specifically, SED leverages a hierarchical backbone (ConvNeXt) instead of a plain transformer to encode images, preserving spatial details with lower complexity. The cost map captures similarity of conv features to frozen CLIP text embeddings. The decoder then fuses this with hierarchical visual features using two modules - aggregating spatial and categorical information, and gradually incorporating multi-scale details. A category rejection scheme is also introduced to focus on detecting the most relevant predicted classes and accelerate inference. Experiments demonstrate SED's strong performance on multiple datasets, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and speed. When using ConvNeXt-B, SED obtains 31.6% mIoU on ADE20K-150 at 82ms/image, outperforming previous methods. Contributions are developing the hierarchical encoder and gradual fusion decoder for open-vocabulary segmentation, and introducing rejection prediction to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an encoder-decoder framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, comprising a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. 

2. It introduces a category early rejection scheme to reject non-existing categories at the early decoder layer to accelerate inference speed without sacrificing performance.

3. The proposed method called SED achieves superior performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation datasets. When using ConvNeXt-L, SED obtains state-of-the-art mIoU scores of 35.2% on A-150 and 22.6% on PC-459.

4. SED provides a good trade-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. For example, it achieves mIoU of 31.6% on A-150 at 82ms per image using ConvNeXt-B, outperforming previous methods with comparable or larger models.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective and efficient encoder-decoder framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets. The category early rejection scheme also allows it to balance performance and speed.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation - The paper focuses on semantic segmentation methods that can handle segmenting pixels into an open set of categories, beyond a predefined closed set.

- Encoder-decoder architecture - The proposed SED method uses an encoder-decoder structure, with a hierarchical encoder for cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder. 

- Hierarchical encoder (ConvNeXt) - Instead of a plain ViT transformer, a hierarchical convolutional backbone ConvNeXt is used as the encoder to better capture spatial context and enable skip connections.

- Cost map generation - Pixel-level similarity scores (cost maps) between image features and text embeddings are generated to guide the segmentation.

- Gradual fusion decoder - The decoder gradually combines the cost map and hierarchical encoder features using feature aggregation and skip-layer fusion modules for refinement.

- Category early rejection - A novel scheme introduced to reject non-present categories early in the decoder to accelerate inference speed.

- Inference speed and accuracy tradeoff - The method aims to achieve a good balance between high accuracy and fast inference time compared to prior arts.
