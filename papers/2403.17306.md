# [Visual Hallucination: Definition, Quantification, and Prescriptive   Remediations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17306)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) presents a major challenge to responsible AI development. However, there is a lack of detailed understanding and benchmarking around visual hallucination. 

- The paper identifies 8 fine-grained categories of visual hallucinations in VLMs across two tasks - image captioning and Visual Question Answering (VQA):
1) Contextual Guessing 
2) Identity Incongruity
3) Geographic Erratum  
4) Visual Illusion
5) Gender Anomaly
6) VLM as Classifier  
7) Wrong Reading
8) Numeric Discrepancy

Proposed Solution:
- The authors curate a dataset called VHiLT comprising 2000 VLM-generated image captions and VQA responses annotated for the presence of visual hallucinations.

- VHiLT covers a wide range of contemporary VLMs like Kosmos-2, MiniGPT-v2, Sphinx etc evaluated on news images from New York Times Twitter handle.

- They propose a taxonomy of current visual hallucination mitigation techniques into three families: data-driven, training adjustments and post-processing.

Main Contributions:  
- Fine-grained categorization of visual hallucinations in VLMs
- VHiLT dataset with human annotations of hallucinations for further research
- Analysis and proposed taxonomy covering state-of-the-art VLM hallucination mitigation techniques

Overall, the paper offers an extensive analysis into understanding, benchmarking and mitigating visual hallucinations in contemporary VLMs through both data and techniques.
