# [Query-Efficient Correlation Clustering with Noisy Oracle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of query-efficient correlation clustering with a noisy oracle. Given a set of n objects and an unknown pairwise similarity function, the goal of correlation clustering is to cluster the objects so that similar objects are put in the same cluster while dissimilar objects are separated. However, computing the similarity function for all O(n^2) pairs can be very costly. The oracle can provide noisy samples of the similarity between a queried pair, but queries to the oracle need to be minimized.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper formulates two novel online learning problems based on Pure Exploration of Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits (PE-CMAB): 

1) Fixed confidence (FC) setting: Given confidence level δ and error ε, find a clustering whose expected cost is within α times the optimal cost plus ε, with probability at least 1-δ, while minimizing queries.

2) Fixed budget (FB) setting: Given budget T and error ε, maximize the probability that the output clustering cost is within α times the optimal cost plus ε, while using at most T queries.

For the FC setting, the paper proposes KC-FC algorithm that uses a threshold bandit strategy to identify high similarity pairs and feeds them to a 5-approximation algorithm KwikCluster. For the FB setting,  KC-FB adaptively determines the number of queries per pair based on KwikCluster.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of two novel PE-CMAB problems for noisy correlation clustering

- KC-FC algorithm for FC setting with theoretical guarantees on sample complexity and approximation ratio  

- KC-FB algorithm for FB setting which achieves exponentially decaying error probability 

- First polynomial time PE-CMAB algorithms for problems with NP-hard offline optimization  

- Thorough experiments demonstrating superiority over baselines in sample complexity and clustering cost

The key novelty is developing PE-CMAB algorithms for noisy correlation clustering that provide theoretical guarantees despite having an NP-hard underlying offline problem. The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
