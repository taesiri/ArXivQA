# [Embedding Large Language Models into Extended Reality: Opportunities and   Challenges for Inclusion, Engagement, and Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper argues for embedding large language models (LLMs) into extended reality (XR) environments as virtual avatars or narratives. The motivation is that LLMs have versatile conversational capabilities and can be fine-tuned and prompted to provide personalized experiences for diverse users. This could make XR environments more inclusive, supporting users regardless of differences like gender or expertise level. 

The authors highlight three main opportunities from using LLMs in XR:

1) Inclusion and diversity. LLMs can be prompted and fine-tuned to adapt their responses for different user groups, providing personalized support without extensive manual effort of creating multiple scripts or agents. This could attract more diverse users to use XR.

2) User engagement. The human-like responses of LLMs could increase user engagement with VR/AR environments, enhancing immersion and interactivity. This could help make XR more commonplace. However, more user interaction means more user data collected.

3) Privacy. Increased engagement means users may provide more personal information to LLM-powered avatars. Combined with XR sensor data, this could enable novel privacy invasions. Research is needed to study possible new privacy risks and user attitudes in XR with LLMs.

In summary, the paper proposes that LLMs provide new opportunities for inclusive, engaging XR experiences by powering adaptive avatars and narratives. But there are open challenges around mitigating problematic LLM behaviors, quantifying engagement gains, and ensuring privacy as more user data becomes available. Overall the paper argues LLMs in XR is a promising research direction despite needing ethical considerations.
