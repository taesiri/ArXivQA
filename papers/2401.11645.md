# [Streaming Bilingual End-to-End ASR model using Attention over Multiple   Softmax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11645)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Providing a good multilingual and code-mixing experience in on-device end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models is challenging. Prior approaches like having multiple monolingual models or simply pooling data from multiple languages perform poorly. The recently proposed MultiSoftmax model eliminates the need for knowing the input language, but requires multiple beam searches during inference, making it computationally expensive and unable to handle code-mixing.

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a novel bilingual end-to-end model based on recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) that can recognize speech in two languages and also support language switching, without needing any language input. The key ideas are:

1) Shared encoder and prediction network with language-specific joint networks and softmax to produce posterior probabilities over language-specific symbols. 

2) Self-attention mechanism to estimate per-language weights for each speech frame. These weights are multiplied with the language-specific posterior probabilities.

3) The weighted posteriors are concatenated to obtain a single probability vector over the combined symbol set of both languages. This enables a single beam search over all symbols.

The self-attention mechanism makes the model learn when to produce symbols from each language, guided by the transcriptions containing words in respective language scripts.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes first streaming, on-device bilingual RNN-T model that can recognize and switch between languages without language ID input.

- Integrates language-specific information via joint networks and attention mechanism to improve performance.

- Enables code-mixing by producing a combined symbol posterior for a single beam search.

- Achieves lower word error rates than baseline bilingual model, with 13.3%, 8.23% and 1.3% relative improvements on Hindi, English and code-mixed test sets.

- Analysis shows self-attention weights correlate well with input language, validating the core idea.

Overall the paper makes an important contribution in advancing multilingual ASR capabilities for on-device models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel bilingual end-to-end automatic speech recognition model using attention over multiple softmax outputs to recognize and switch between languages without needing explicit language identification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel bilingual end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that can recognize speech in two languages (English and Hindi) as well as code-mixed speech, without needing to know the language of the input speech. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing a bilingual MultiSoftmax Attention (MSA) model that has shared encoder and prediction networks, along with language-specific components combined via a self-attention mechanism. This allows recognizing both languages with a single beam search decoding.

- The self-attention mechanism estimates weights for each language which are used to combine the language-specific posterior probabilities into a single posterior vector over the unified symbol set. This enables code-mixing support within the model.

- The proposed model achieves lower word error rates compared to a vanilla bilingual baseline, with 13.3%, 8.23% and 1.3% relative improvements on Hindi, English and code-mixed test sets respectively.

- Analysis of the attention weights shows the model's ability to capture language information even without explicit language ID input, which helps improve performance especially on code-mixed speech.

In summary, the key novelty is the bilingual MultiSoftmax Attention model architecture that can handle code-mixing and recognize speech in two languages, in a streaming and language-identification-free manner suitable for on-device applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Bilingual ASR: The paper focuses on bilingual automatic speech recognition, specifically for English and Hindi.

- Streaming ASR: The proposed models are designed for streaming ASR, meaning they can process speech in real-time as it is spoken rather than needing the full utterance upfront. 

- End-to-end: The models are end-to-end, meaning they directly predict text from input speech rather than relying on separate acoustic, pronunciation and language models.

- RNN-T: The base model architecture used is the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T).

- Attention: An attention mechanism is proposed to weight the language-specific outputs.

- Code-mixing/Code-switching: The models aim to handle code-mixed speech where the speaker mixes multiple languages.

- Multilingual: The overarching focus is on multilingual speech recognition.

- On-device: The target application is on-device speech recognition with low latency and small footprint.

In summary, the key focus areas are bilingual/multilingual streaming end-to-end ASR using RNN-T with attention to handle code-mixing, designed for on-device usage.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a bilingual MultiSoftmaxAttn model. Explain in detail the architecture of this model and how it differs from the vanilla bilingual and bilingual MultiSoftmax models.

2. The motivation behind proposing the bilingual MultiSoftmaxAttn model is to enable a single beam search over the combined symbol set. Elaborate on why this is beneficial compared to having separate beam search decoding for each language.  

3. The bilingual MultiSoftmaxAttn model incorporates an attention mechanism to estimate language-specific weights $w_{en}$ and $w_{hi}$. Explain the purpose and working of this attention mechanism. How does it help in code-mixing?

4. The attention mechanism in the proposed model uses a certain number of future frames along with past frames. Discuss the implication of using future frames on the streaming capability of the model. Also compare results with 10 vs infinite lookahead.

5. The training methodology involves pre-training a MultiSoftmax model first before training the bilingual MultiSoftmax and finally the bilingual MultiSoftmaxAttn model. Justify this incremental training strategy.

6. An analysis of the attention weights is provided in the paper to demonstrate its efficacy. Summarize the key observations from this analysis for monolingual and code-mixed speech. 

7. The proposed model uses shared encoder and prediction networks with language-specific components. Discuss the motivation behind using shared and language-specific components.

8. The model is described as an implicit language identification system. Elaborate on how the model identifies the language without explicit language inputs.

9. The results demonstrate significant gains over the vanilla bilingual system. Attribute these gains to the specific components/modeling techniques used in the bilingual MultiSoftmaxAttn model.

10. The paper identifies some limitations such as fluctuations in attention weights across adjacent frames. Suggest methods to address this issue.
