# [Retrieval augmented text-to-SQL generation for epidemiological question   answering using electronic health records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Querying electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases to answer epidemiological questions is challenging. It requires interpreting complex medical terminology, formulating precise SQL queries, executing them correctly, and accurately synthesizing the results. This is a key capability needed by healthcare organizations to analyze real-world data and gain valuable insights. 

Proposed Solution: The authors present an end-to-end approach that combines text-to-SQL generation with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to answer epidemiological questions using EHRs and claims data. Their key innovation is integrating a medical coding step that maps textual entities to clinical codes, enabling accurate data retrieval. 

The workflow starts by transforming a natural language question into an SQL query using large language models (LLMs) prompted with instructions and examples. The LLM generates SQL with placeholders for medical entities. These entities are then normalized to standard codes via an automated mapping and verification process. The resulting executable SQL query, embedding target codes, retrieves the needed data from an OMOP CDM-standardized database. If required, the answer can be articulated from the retrieved data by further LLM prompting.

To improve SQL generation, they apply RAG to incorporate relevant examples from a curated dataset into the LLM prompt. This additional in-domain context enhances the model's performance.

Main Contributions:

- Release of a manually curated dataset of 306 epidemiological question-SQL pairs conforming to the OMOP CDM standard to enable reproducible research
- Integration of a medical coding step into text-to-SQL translation to boost clinical context comprehension 
- Demonstration that RAG leads to significant gains over static prompting across all benchmarked LLMs
- Present an end-to-end solution combining text-to-SQL, entity coding, RAG prompting, and optional answer generation that can effectively leverage large pools of clinical data to address epidemiological questions

The presented approach shows promising results on a synthetic dataset of 6.8 million records. It could be applied to over 2 billion patient records available in OMOP format. The paper shares code to spur follow-on research in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an end-to-end methodology combining text-to-SQL generation with retrieval augmented generation to answer epidemiological questions using electronic health records and claims data, introducing a medical coding step to improve performance over simple prompting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors release a new dataset of manually annotated question-SQL pairs for epidemiological research using electronic health records and claims data. The dataset conforms to the OMOP Common Data Model standard.

2. They integrate a medical coding step into the text-to-SQL generation process to enhance comprehension of clinical context and improve data retrieval. 

3. They show that retrieval augmented generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance of large language models on this task compared to static instruction prompting.

4. They benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPT-4 Turbo performs the best overall. The open-source Mixtral lags behind proprietary models.

5. They share their dataset, code, and prompts to foster reproducibility and advance research in this area.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing an end-to-end methodology combining text-to-SQL generation and retrieval augmentation to answer epidemiological questions using real-world data, evaluated on a new dataset. The integration of medical coding and showing RAG's utility for small domain-specific datasets are also key contributions.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Electronic health records (EHRs)
- Claims data 
- Real-world data (RWD)
- Epidemiological questions
- Text-to-SQL generation
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
- Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM)

The paper focuses on using RAG and prompting of LLMs to translate natural language epidemiological questions into SQL queries that can retrieve answers from EHR and claims databases structured under the OMOP-CDM standard. Key aspects include the creation of an industry-focused dataset of question-SQL pairs, integration of medical coding into the text-to-SQL pipeline, and benchmarking of different LLMs with and without retrieval augmentation. The goal is to develop an end-to-end methodology for unlocking RWD to address real-world epidemiology questions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a medical coding step to map medical entities to standard codes. What are the advantages and potential drawbacks of this approach compared to end-to-end text-to-SQL methods that do not include an intermediate coding step?

2. The paper uses the OMOP Common Data Model to ensure queries are executable across different databases. What are some challenges in mapping arbitrary natural language questions to this structured data model? How could the approach be adapted for other data models?

3. The retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach shows significant improvements over static prompting. What factors contribute to this performance increase? How could the retrieval and relevance ranking be further improved? 

4. The paper finds diminishing returns when providing more than 1 or 2 similar questions as context. What is the explanation for this finding? How could the model optimize usage of multiple context examples?

5. What are other potential applications of this methodology beyond epidemiology questions using EHR data? What adaptations would be required to extend this approach to other domains?

6. The dataset used in the paper is small and specialized. What strategies could be used to expand the training data in terms of size and diversity while retaining label quality?

7. The evaluation uses a synthetic public dataset. What are the challenges in applying and evaluating the method on private real-world industry databases? How could the approach be safely tested and validated?

8. What customizations would be needed to deploy this system at a healthcare organization for analysts to use? What monitoring,controls and adjustment capabilities should be in place?

9. How do the different neural network architectures compare in leveraging retrieval context? What accounts for Mistral and GPT's better few-shot learning performance?

10. The paper focuses on generating queries to retrieve answers. How could the system be extended to generate natural language explanations and summaries from the retrieved data?
