# [Efficient View Synthesis and 3D-based Multi-Frame Denoising with   Multiplane Feature Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18139)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform efficient and high-quality 3D-based multi-frame denoising using multiplane representations. 

Specifically, the paper focuses on solving two key challenges:

1. Cross-depth consistency in multiplane representations: How to enforce consistency across different depth planes in the multiplane representation to avoid artifacts and improve quality.

2. 3D-based multi-frame denoising: How to re-purpose multiplane image representations originally developed for novel view synthesis for the task of multi-frame video denoising by exploiting 3D scene structure.

To address these challenges, the paper introduces a new framework called Multiplane Feature Encoder-Renderer (MPFER) that represents scenes using multiplane features (MPF) rather than standard multiplane images (MPI). The key ideas are:

- Enforcing cross-depth consistency at the rendering stage using a learned renderer rather than in the encoder. This allows the encoder to focus only on fusing information across views.

- Moving the multiplane representation to feature space rather than RGB space. This increases representational power. 

- Applying the re-designed MPF framework to multi-frame denoising by using input views for both encoding and rendering. This enables exploiting 3D structure for denoising.

The central hypothesis is that the proposed MPF representation and encoder-renderer architecture will enable efficient, high-quality 3D-based multi-frame denoising compared to prior 2D and 3D methods. The experiments validate this hypothesis empirically on different datasets.
