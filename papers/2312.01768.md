# [Localizing and Assessing Node Significance in Default Mode Network using   Sub-Community Detection in Mild Cognitive Impairment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01768)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel graph-based method to identify and quantify the most affected regions within the default mode network (DMN) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Functional MRI data from 50 MCI subjects and 50 healthy controls was used to construct individual DMN connectivity graphs. Four sub-community detection algorithms - Clique Percolation Method, Louvain, Greedy Modularity, and Leading Eigenvectors - were applied to find the largest sub-community in each graph. A new metric called Node Significance Score (NSS) was introduced to assess the participation level of each DMN region of interest (ROI) in the sub-communities. The scores were compared between groups to calculate percentage disparity for each node. Results revealed over 20% NSS disparity for 10 ROIs, with peak values of 45.69% for posterior cingulate cortex and 43.08% for fusiform gyrus, aligning with existing research on their pivotal roles. The proposed technique enables the quantification and ordering of affected regions, providing valuable insights into targeting treatments for MCI and cognitive decline.
