# [Embodied Executable Policy Learning with Language-based Scene   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05696)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is: How can we effectively leverage large language models (LLMs) to assist robot learning from visual observations?Specifically, the key challenges the paper identifies regarding using LLMs for robot learning are:1) LLMs lack the capability to understand non-text-based environment observations like images that robots receive.2) There is a large distribution shift between the training data of pretrained models and the target robot learning tasks.To address these challenges, the main hypothesis of the paper is:By generating natural language descriptions of visual observations through a scene understanding module, and then feeding these descriptions into a large language model to produce executable actions, the combined model can effectively assist robot learning from pure visual inputs.The key aspects of their proposed approach are:- Using a multimodal scene understanding module (SUM) to generate textual scene descriptions from visual observations.- Feeding these textual descriptions into an action prediction module (APM) based on LLMs to produce executable robot actions.- Fine-tuning the SUM and APM modules on in-domain robot learning tasks via imitation learning or reinforcement learning to adapt them to the target domain.The central hypothesis is that by bridging visual observations and executable actions through natural language generation, the model can leverage the knowledge encoded in both multimodal models like SUM and large pretrained language models like those used in APM. The fine-tuning further adapts these models to the nuances of specific robot learning tasks.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively integrate multimodal perception and large language models to assist robot learning from realistic visual observations, which their proposed approach aims to address.
