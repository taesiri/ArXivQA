# [Clustered Orienteering Problem with Subgroups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper introduces a novel variant of the Orienteering Problem (OP) called the Clustered Orienteering Problem with Subgroups (COPS). In COPS, the nodes are organized into subgroups, and the subgroups are grouped into clusters. Each subgroup has an associated reward that is collected only if all the vertices in that subgroup are visited, with a constraint that at most one subgroup can be visited per cluster. The objective is to find a path that maximizes the total collected reward while respecting a pre-defined travel budget. 

The COPS formulation generalizes previous variants like the Clustered OP (COP), where a reward is associated with each cluster and collected only if all vertices in the cluster are visited, and the Set OP (SOP), where the reward is collected by visiting at least one vertex in the cluster. COPS can model heterogeneous subgroups within a cluster which was not possible earlier.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two approaches to solve COPS:

1. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation: An exact optimization approach where constraints are defined based on subgroups, clusters, vertices, edges etc. The objective function maximizes total subgroup rewards.

2. Tabu Search heuristic: A metaheuristic approach that starts with an initial solution and iteratively searches the neighborhood to find better solutions. It uses techniques like tabu lists, aspiration criteria, long-term memory of subgroups to guide the search.  

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of the COPS variant that generalizes COP and SOP, and can model new scenarios with heterogeneous subgroups inside a cluster
- An exact ILP formulation for the COPS 
- An efficient Tabu Search heuristic to solve large problem instances
- Analysis showing the ILP guarantees optimality at the expense of time, while Tabu Search gives good quality solutions with reasonable runtime
- Demonstration of how COPS enables new applications through the subgroup-cluster formulation

In summary, the paper introduces a novel COPS formulation that advances existing OP variants, and provides both exact and heuristic methods to effectively solve this new problem. The utility of COPS is shown through its ability to model heterogeneous intra-cluster scenarios.
