# [Windowed-FourierMixer: Enhancing Clutter-Free Room Modeling with Fourier   Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18287)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of transforming cluttered indoor environments in images into clutter-free rooms. Specifically, it focuses on inpainting or filling in missing regions where clutter objects have been removed, in order to generate complete and visually coherent clutter-free room renderings. This is a challenging problem because typical inpainting methods fail to preserve structural integrity and layout of indoor spaces.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a single-phase adversarial framework consisting of a Uformer-like generator and a patch discriminator. The key novelty is a new block called Windowed-FourierMixer (W-FM) that leverages Fourier transforms and gated convolutions to effectively capture indoor scene characteristics like symmetry and repetitive patterns. 

Applying Fourier transform separately on height and width enables vertical or horizontal symmetry, allowing better understanding of structures like ceiling height and cuboid room shape. Further, a windowing operation and gated convolutions enable localized and learnable fusion of these symmetric features. Overall, this architecture provides a unified network that generates clutter-free rooms without needing explicit structure estimation guiding the process.

The model is trained on synthetic indoor panorama datasets using multiple loss functions like reconstruction, perceptual, adversarial etc. along with a novel aggressive mask strategy to simulate diverse real-world occlusion patterns.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of an end-to-end single-phase adversarial framework for clutter-free room modeling without reliance on layout estimation networks.

- Introduction of a novel Windowed-FourierMixer (W-FM) block that leverages Fourier transform and gated convolutions tailored for indoor image characteristics.

- Demonstration of state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on Structured3D dataset across various masks, outperforming recent methods like LaMa, PanoDR and LGPN.

- Ablation studies validating the contribution of proposed W-FM block over alternatives, and the utility of windowing operation and perceptual loss choices.

In summary, the paper makes significant advances in clutter-free room modeling by developing a Fourier transform-enhanced architecture that implicitly captures structural and repetitive patterns in indoor scenes.
