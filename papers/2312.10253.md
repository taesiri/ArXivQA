# [Catwalk: A Unified Language Model Evaluation Framework for Many Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10253)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Evaluating large language models (LLMs) across many datasets and tasks is important for understanding their capabilities and limitations. However, the fragmented efforts in producing models and datasets have led to incompatible codebases and data formats, making it difficult to conduct fair, controlled experiments across models and datasets. This requires extensive reimplementation to evaluate models on new datasets.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Catwalk, a unified framework for evaluating LLMs across datasets and models. Catwalk provides common interfaces to connect models and datasets, standardizing evaluations. It currently supports over 800 datasets and various model types including encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder models which can be evaluated with zero-shot, few-shot, finetuning approaches. 

Catwalk transforms datasets into common formats suited for model execution, so models only depend on these formats. It computes suggested evaluation metrics for datasets and caches intermediate results to minimize redundant workloads. Models and datasets can be included by simply instantiating a few interfaces.

Main Contributions:
- Interface abstractions to unify evaluation of diverse models on many datasets
- Support for 800+ datasets and model evaluation approaches like zero-shot, finetuning etc.  
- Case study comparing 30+ models on 17 datasets
- Modular design allowing easy integration of new models and datasets
- Open source framework enabling large-scale controlled experiments across models and datasets with minimal implementation overhead

By standardizing evaluation, Catwalk aims to reduce the engineering barriers towards fair benchmarking of LLMs across a diverse set of datasets and tasks. The paper's results showcase Catwalk's ability to produce evaluation matrices spanning hundreds of model-dataset combinations with minimal configuration.
