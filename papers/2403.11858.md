# [GPT-4 as Evaluator: Evaluating Large Language Models on Pest Management   in Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11858)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Application of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in agriculture and pest management remains limited. Evaluating the quality and accuracy of text generated by LLMs for pest management advice is challenging.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using GPT-4 itself as an evaluator to assess the quality of pest management suggestions generated by different LLMs. They test GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Google's FLAN-T5 model using four prompting techniques - zero-shot, few-shot, instruction-based and self-consistency prompting. An expert system comprising crop pest data is used as a baseline to label samples for evaluation.  

Key Contributions:
1) Demonstrates feasibility of using LLMs for pest management advice generation in agriculture.
2) Introduces an innovative GPT-4 based evaluation methodology to score generated suggestions on multiple quality parameters. 
3) Shows a 72% accuracy rate using instruction-based prompting containing domain knowledge, proving effectiveness of LLMs.
4) Uncovers subtle differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in pest management decision making, highlighting the need for tailored model selection.

Overall, the paper makes a novel contribution in evaluating LLMs for agriculture using GPT-4 itself as the evaluator. The results prove LLMs can be an effective tool for pest management in agriculture when combined with instruction-based prompting and domain knowledge. Subtle model differences are uncovered that can guide selection.
