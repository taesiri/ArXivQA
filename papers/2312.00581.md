# [Pathway to a fully data-driven geotechnics: lessons from materials   informatics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00581)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper elucidates the intricate complexities inherent in soils and contrasts them against the remarkable capabilities of modern deep learning techniques to showcase the tremendous yet underexploited potential of integrating data-driven methodologies into geotechnics. Underscoring soil's multiscale, multiphase heterogeneity and geospatial-temporal variances, the paper spotlights the pressing need for open science movements and community-driven database initiatives to overcome current challenges like data scarcity. It envisions a future where techniques like transfer learning coupled with tailored database architectures can propel innovative data-centric solutions in geotechnics. By harnessing collective expertise through collaborative platforms, much like the triumphs witnessed in materials informatics, the study foresees a fusion of domain knowledge and computational prowess that promises a paradigm shift towards data-driven geotechnics. Advances like large language models further augment this transition by making complex data more interpretable and actionable.
