# Critic-Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is: How can we combine the strengths of reinforcement learning (RL) and weighted decoding for controlled text generation?The paper proposes an approach called Critic-Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation (CriticControl) that aims to leverage RL and weighted decoding in a complementary way for improved controlled text generation. Specifically, the paper investigates whether freezing the language model and training a critic network via RL, while using the critic to guide decoding similar to weighted decoding, can lead to more stable training, flexible control, and high text quality compared to using either RL or weighted decoding alone. The paper evaluates CriticControl on topic control, sentiment control, and detoxification tasks. The central hypothesis is that CriticControl will outperform existing methods that rely solely on either RL or weighted decoding in terms of control performance, text fluency/quality, and generalization ability. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively combine RL and weighted decoding for controlled text generation, with the hypothesis that the proposed CriticControl approach will achieve better performance compared to using either technique alone. The paper presents experiments on various text generation tasks to evaluate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposes a novel controlled text generation method called Critic-Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation (CriticControl) that combines reinforcement learning and weighted decoding. 2. Freezes the language model and trains a critic network using actor-critic reinforcement learning to steer the output distribution, improving training efficiency and stability.3. Evaluates CriticControl on three controlled text generation tasks - topic control, sentiment control, and detoxification. Shows that it outperforms previous methods in terms of control success, fluency, and diversity.4. Demonstrates that CriticControl has superior generalization ability on zero-shot control tasks thanks to its generic reward model design.5. Conducts human evaluation studies that validate the improved control and text quality of CriticControl compared to baselines.In summary, the key novelty is the proposed CriticControl method that combines strengths of RL and weighted decoding for controlled text generation. The experiments on various tasks and human studies demonstrate its effectiveness for steering language models to desired attributes while generating coherent and high-quality text. The results also show CriticControl's strong generalization ability in zero-shot settings.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in controlled text generation:- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach, CriticControl, that combines reinforcement learning and weighted decoding for controlled text generation. This is a unique combination that aims to leverage the strengths of both techniques. - For reinforcement learning, the authors build on prior work like PPO training for text generation. However, a key difference is that they freeze the language model and only train an additional critic network, rather than fine-tuning the entire LM like in most prior RL work. This is more akin to weighted decoding.- For weighted decoding, this work can be compared to methods like PPLM, GeDi, and FUDGE. The key difference of CriticControl is using an RL-trained critic to shift probabilities, rather than relying solely on external classifier models. - Overall, CriticControl demonstrates improved performance over prior baselines in tasks like topic control, sentiment modification, and detoxification. The results suggest it better combines controllability with fluency compared to previous weighted decoding methods.- One limitation compared to some prior work is the computational cost of using CriticControl with very large LMs like GPT-3. The authors suggest offline RL as a potential solution to improve scalability.- An advantage of CriticControl seems to be better generalizability by using a more generic reward model, rather than task-specific classifiers. This is shown in the zero-shot control experiments.In summary, CriticControl proposes a unique fusion of RL and weighted decoding that outperforms prior baselines in controlled generation tasks. The results highlight the benefits of a critic-guided approach compared to external classifier models. Key limitations are computational efficiency with very large LMs and general applicability to many control settings.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Applying offline reinforcement learning techniques to address the high computational cost of exploring with large language models like GPT-3. The authors mention offline RL as a potential solution to make CriticControl more scalable.- Extending CriticControl to multi-attribute control settings. The method currently focuses on binary control tasks, but the authors suggest it could potentially handle controlling for multiple attributes simultaneously using a general reward model. - Combining CriticControl with other reinforcement learning problems and algorithms. The authors state CriticControl has promising potential to be integrated with different RL formulations for controlled text generation.- Evaluating CriticControl on a wider range of text generation tasks beyond the three presented in the paper (topic control, sentiment control, detoxification). The authors demonstrate it is effective on those tasks, but could be assessed on other types of controlled generation as well.- Exploring variations on the reward model design. The authors note the flexibility of being able to freely design the reward model is a benefit of CriticControl, so investigating different reward formulations could be valuable.- Applying CriticControl to languages other than English and assessing how it handles different linguistic properties. The current experiments are English-only.In summary, the main future directions are exploring the scalability of CriticControl, extending it to more complex control settings, integrating it with other RL methods, evaluating on more text generation tasks, trying different reward models, and testing it on non-English languages. The authors frame CriticControl as a promising approach that can serve as a basis for much further research on controlled text generation.
