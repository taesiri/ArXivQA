# [Critic-Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we combine the strengths of reinforcement learning (RL) and weighted decoding for controlled text generation?

The paper proposes an approach called Critic-Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation (CriticControl) that aims to leverage RL and weighted decoding in a complementary way for improved controlled text generation. 

Specifically, the paper investigates whether freezing the language model and training a critic network via RL, while using the critic to guide decoding similar to weighted decoding, can lead to more stable training, flexible control, and high text quality compared to using either RL or weighted decoding alone. 

The paper evaluates CriticControl on topic control, sentiment control, and detoxification tasks. The central hypothesis is that CriticControl will outperform existing methods that rely solely on either RL or weighted decoding in terms of control performance, text fluency/quality, and generalization ability. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research question is how to effectively combine RL and weighted decoding for controlled text generation, with the hypothesis that the proposed CriticControl approach will achieve better performance compared to using either technique alone. The paper presents experiments on various text generation tasks to evaluate this hypothesis.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel controlled text generation method called CriticControl that combines reinforcement learning and weighted decoding, demonstrating improved performance on tasks like topic control, sentiment modification, and detoxification compared to prior approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in controlled text generation:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach, CriticControl, that combines reinforcement learning and weighted decoding for controlled text generation. This is a unique combination that aims to leverage the strengths of both techniques. 

- For reinforcement learning, the authors build on prior work like PPO training for text generation. However, a key difference is that they freeze the language model and only train an additional critic network, rather than fine-tuning the entire LM like in most prior RL work. This is more akin to weighted decoding.

- For weighted decoding, this work can be compared to methods like PPLM, GeDi, and FUDGE. The key difference of CriticControl is using an RL-trained critic to shift probabilities, rather than relying solely on external classifier models. 

- Overall, CriticControl demonstrates improved performance over prior baselines in tasks like topic control, sentiment modification, and detoxification. The results suggest it better combines controllability with fluency compared to previous weighted decoding methods.

- One limitation compared to some prior work is the computational cost of using CriticControl with very large LMs like GPT-3. The authors suggest offline RL as a potential solution to improve scalability.

- An advantage of CriticControl seems to be better generalizability by using a more generic reward model, rather than task-specific classifiers. This is shown in the zero-shot control experiments.

In summary, CriticControl proposes a unique fusion of RL and weighted decoding that outperforms prior baselines in controlled generation tasks. The results highlight the benefits of a critic-guided approach compared to external classifier models. Key limitations are computational efficiency with very large LMs and general applicability to many control settings.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying offline reinforcement learning techniques to address the high computational cost of exploring with large language models like GPT-3. The authors mention offline RL as a potential solution to make CriticControl more scalable.

- Extending CriticControl to multi-attribute control settings. The method currently focuses on binary control tasks, but the authors suggest it could potentially handle controlling for multiple attributes simultaneously using a general reward model. 

- Combining CriticControl with other reinforcement learning problems and algorithms. The authors state CriticControl has promising potential to be integrated with different RL formulations for controlled text generation.

- Evaluating CriticControl on a wider range of text generation tasks beyond the three presented in the paper (topic control, sentiment control, detoxification). The authors demonstrate it is effective on those tasks, but could be assessed on other types of controlled generation as well.

- Exploring variations on the reward model design. The authors note the flexibility of being able to freely design the reward model is a benefit of CriticControl, so investigating different reward formulations could be valuable.

- Applying CriticControl to languages other than English and assessing how it handles different linguistic properties. The current experiments are English-only.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring the scalability of CriticControl, extending it to more complex control settings, integrating it with other RL methods, evaluating on more text generation tasks, trying different reward models, and testing it on non-English languages. The authors frame CriticControl as a promising approach that can serve as a basis for much further research on controlled text generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel controlled text generation method called CriticControl that combines reinforcement learning and weighted decoding approaches. The key idea is to use an actor-critic framework where the pre-trained language model is frozen and acts as the actor to generate text, while a critic network is trained using reinforcement learning to predict state values based on rewards from an attribute classifier. During inference, the critic adjusts the actor's output distribution to bias generation towards attributes with higher predicted state value. Experiments on topic control, sentiment modification, and detoxification tasks show CriticControl outperforms previous methods in control performance, fluency, and diversity. A notable advantage is the strong zero-shot generalization ability enabled by the generic reward modeling. Limitations include high computational cost for large LMs, which may be mitigated through offline RL. Overall, CriticControl demonstrates effective attribute control for text generation while maintaining high quality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel critic decoding method for controlled language generation (CriticControl) that combines reinforcement learning and weighted decoding approaches. The method adopts an actor-critic framework where the critic is trained to predict state values using non-differentiable rewards from external models. During decoding, the critic adjusts the output token probabilities from the frozen language model to steer generation towards desired attributes. This allows for stable and efficient training compared to fully finetuning language models, while achieving strong controllability. 

The proposed method is evaluated on topic control, sentiment control and detoxification tasks. Experiments demonstrate that CriticControl outperforms previous methods like PPLM and GeDi in terms of control success, fluency and diversity, based on both automatic metrics and human evaluations. An additional benefit is the method's superior generalization ability in zero-shot control settings. Limitations include high computational costs for large language models, which may be mitigated through offline reinforcement learning. Overall, CriticControl shows promise as an effective approach for controlled text generation across a variety of attributes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel controlled text generation method called Critic-Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation (CriticControl) that combines reinforcement learning and weighted decoding. The core idea is to train a critic network using an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework to predict state values that represent how well the generated text aligns with a target attribute. During inference, CriticControl reweights the output token distributions from a frozen pre-trained language model based on the ratio of the state values for having versus not having that token. Specifically, tokens that increase the state value are upweighted while others are downweighted. This steering of the language model output allows generating attribute-specific text while maintaining language quality. The method is evaluated on topic control, sentiment control, and detoxification tasks, outperforming previous approaches that rely solely on either reinforcement learning or weighted decoding. A key advantage is the ability to generalize to unseen attributes through the learned critic.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the problem of controlled text generation using large language models. Specifically, it proposes a method called "Critic-Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation" (CriticControl) that aims to steer language model outputs towards desired attributes while maintaining high quality. 

The key questions and goals seem to be:

- How can we leverage the strengths of both reinforcement learning (RL) and weighted decoding approaches for controlled text generation? RL offers good control performance but unstable training, while weighted decoding is more efficient but can impact text quality.

- Can we combine RL and weighted decoding in a way that achieves both good control and high text quality? 

- How can we train critics to steer language models towards control objectives defined by reward models, while keeping the language model itself frozen?

- Will this approach allow flexible integration and control of any language model in a plug-and-play manner? 

- Can the method generalize well to unseen control tasks and attributes?

- How does the proposed CriticControl method perform on tasks like topic control, sentiment modification, and detoxification compared to existing baselines?

- Can it generate coherent, fluent text that adheres to the control constraints?

So in summary, the key focus seems to be on developing a controlled text generation method that harnesses the benefits of both RL and weighted decoding to flexibly steer language models towards desired objectives and attributes while maintaining high text quality. Evaluating this on various tasks and generalization ability is a core part of the work.
