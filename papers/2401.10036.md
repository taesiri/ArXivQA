# [LOCALINTEL: Generating Organizational Threat Intelligence from Global   and Local Cyber Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Security analysts in organizations' Security Operations Centers (SoCs) currently have to manually contextualize generic global cyber threat intelligence from public repositories to suit their organization's specific needs using their private local knowledge databases. This manual process is time-consuming, costly, prone to errors, and delays threat mitigation.  

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a novel system called LocalIntel that can automatically generate organization-specific cyber threat intelligence by retrieving and contextualizing generic threat information from global repositories using the organization's local knowledge database.

LocalIntel has three key phases: 
1) Global threat retrieval: Retrieves relevant threat reports from public global repositories based on the input prompt query.  
2) Local knowledge retrieval: Retrieves organization's private local knowledge relevant to the prompt and global threat, such as network configs, software specifics, etc.
3) Contextualized completion generation: Fuses the global and local knowledge to generate tailored cyber threat intelligence specific to the organization.

LocalIntel utilizes capabilities of Large Language Models like GPT-3, retrieval augmentation, and querying to implement the three phases.

Main Contributions:
1) A new automated technique to customize global cyber threat intelligence to any organization's specific context by utilizing both global and local knowledge sources.
2) Minimizes the need for manual customization of threat intelligence by analysts.
3) Enables faster comprehension of implications of novel threats and quicker policy updates.
4) Demonstrated high proficiency in generating accurate and contextually relevant threat intelligence.

In summary, LocalIntel automates the integration of globally available threat intelligence with locally available organizational data to generate tailored actionable threat intelligence specific to an organization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents LocalIntel, a novel system that automatically generates organization-specific cyber threat intelligence by retrieving relevant global threat knowledge and fusing it with local organizational data using large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors built a retrieval-augmented question-answering system that generates contextualized local cyber threat intelligence output by leveraging global and local knowledge for specific input.

2. They demonstrate the possibility of tailoring generic threat intelligence for a specific organizational context using its local infrastructural and peripheral knowledge. This minimizes the manual effort for SoC analysts and produces accurate and relevant organization-specific CTI.

3. They showcase the system's proficiency in generating accurate and contextually relevant answers through both qualitative and quantitative metrics. The system exhibited a high answer relevancy score of 0.95 with a low standard deviation of 0.02, highlighting its ability to consistently provide relevant information.

In summary, the key contribution is an automated knowledge contextualization system that can take global threat intelligence as input, incorporate organizational specifics from a local knowledge base, and output tailored threat intelligence specific to that organization. This reduces manual effort while improving accuracy and relevance.

The paper introduces a system called "LocalIntel" that generates contextualized cyber threat intelligence for an organization by combining global threat intelligence from public databases with an organization's local knowledge base. It uses large language models and a retrieval augmented generation approach to produce threat intelligence responses tailored to an organization's specific environment and infrastructure when prompted with questions. The system is evaluated both qualitatively through example responses and quantitatively using a specialized automated evaluation metric for retrieval augmented generation systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Large Language Model (LLM) as the foundation for the system. What were the key advantages of using an LLM over other NLP methods? What architecture and pre-training techniques did the authors use for the LLM?

2. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method is a key part of the proposed system. Explain in detail how the retriever and generator components work together in the RAG pipeline for this application. What were the inputs and outputs of each component? 

3. The system relies on global and local knowledge sources. Discuss the difference between these two knowledge sources and why both were necessary to generate organization-specific threat intelligence. What were some examples provided of each knowledge source?

4. Explain the overall workflow of the system from receiving the initial prompt to generating the final response completion. What were the key phases and how did the different system components interact in each phase? 

5. The system uses a technique called "prompting" or "in-context learning" to encourage the LLM to generate relevant responses. Explain what this technique involves and why it was important for improving the LLM's outputs.

6. What database solution was used to store the vectorized local knowledge? Why was a vector database better suited than a traditional database for retrieving relevant local knowledge? 

7. The paper employed both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Compare and contrast these two evaluation approaches. What specific quantitative metric was used and why was it well-suited for this application?

8. Was the LLM fine-tuned in any way for this cybersecurity application or was it used in an off-the-shelf capacity? Justify why fine-tuning may or may not have been beneficial for the system.

9. The paper mentions that the LLM can sometimes generate "hallucinations" or factually incorrect responses. Other than the ReAct framework, what measures could be taken to further improve the factual accuracy of the LLM's responses? 

10. How do you think this method could be extended to additional applications beyond generating organizational threat intelligence? What other use cases could benefit from a similar approach?
