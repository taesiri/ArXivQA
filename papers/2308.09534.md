# [Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and   Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the challenge of detecting small objects in images. The main research questions/hypotheses are:1. Current object detectors struggle to generate sufficient high-quality proposals for small objects due to low overlap between anchors and small object regions. The paper proposes a Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to address this limitation.2. Small objects lack discriminative features compared to larger objects. The paper proposes a Feature Imitation (FI) branch that uses features from high-quality detections of larger objects to help improve feature representations for small objects. 3. A two-stage detector combining CRPN and FI can achieve state-of-the-art performance on small object detection benchmarks compared to other mainstream detectors.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by generating better region proposals tailored for small objects via CRPN and improving feature representations of small objects through imitation learning in the FI branch, the two-stage CFINet detector can significantly improve small object detection performance. The experiments on SODA datasets validate this hypothesis and show state-of-the-art results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing CFINet, a two-stage object detection framework tailored for small object detection. The key ideas are:1. It proposes Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to generate high-quality proposals for small objects. CRPN uses an area-based anchor selection strategy and cascade regression to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals. 2. It introduces a Feature Imitation (FI) branch in the detection head to facilitate learning representations of small instances that perplex the model. The FI branch leverages features of high-quality instances to guide learning of instances with uncertain predictions in an imitation manner. A supervision loss based on contrastive learning is used.3. Integrating CRPN and FI branch with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on small object detection benchmarks SODA-D and SODA-A. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques for detecting small objects.In summary, the main contribution is developing a dedicated two-stage detection framework for small objects, by proposing CRPN for better proposals and FI branch for better features, and showing superior performance on small object benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage small object detection framework called CFINet that uses a Coarse-to-fine Region Proposal Network (CRPN) to generate high-quality proposals for small objects and a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate learning representations of small objects by pulling their features close to exemplar features in an embedding space.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in small object detection:- This paper proposes a new two-stage detector called CFINet based on coarse-to-fine region proposal generation and feature imitation learning. Most prior work has focused on improving either the region proposal stage or the classification stage, while this combines improvements in both.- For region proposal, the paper introduces a Coarse-to-Fine RPN (CRPN) that uses an area-based anchor selection strategy and cascade regression to generate higher quality proposals for small objects. This is a novel approach compared to previous RPN enhancements like Cascade RPN that relied only on distance metrics.- For classification, the paper proposes a new Feature Imitation (FI) branch that pulls uncertain predictions closer to exemplar features of the same class using a contrastive loss. Most prior work on improving small object classification used GANs or super-resolution, which can be complex. The FI branch is a simpler supervised contrastive learning approach.- The proposed CFINet obtains state-of-the-art results on the large-scale SODA small object detection datasets, outperforming recent methods like RFLA. The improvements are particularly significant on the most challenging extremely small instances.- One limitation is that the performance of the FI branch relies heavily on the quality of exemplar features, which can vary across training runs. More work may be needed to develop a more robust exemplar quality assessment.In summary, CFINet combines novel improvements in both region proposal and classification stages using relatively simple and intuitive techniques compared to prior work. The strong results highlight the potential of this coarse-to-fine approach and contrastive feature imitation for small object detection.
