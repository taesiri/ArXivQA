# [Small Object Detection via Coarse-to-fine Proposal Generation and   Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the challenge of detecting small objects in images. The main research questions/hypotheses are:1. Current object detectors struggle to generate sufficient high-quality proposals for small objects due to low overlap between anchors and small object regions. The paper proposes a Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to address this limitation.2. Small objects lack discriminative features compared to larger objects. The paper proposes a Feature Imitation (FI) branch that uses features from high-quality detections of larger objects to help improve feature representations for small objects. 3. A two-stage detector combining CRPN and FI can achieve state-of-the-art performance on small object detection benchmarks compared to other mainstream detectors.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by generating better region proposals tailored for small objects via CRPN and improving feature representations of small objects through imitation learning in the FI branch, the two-stage CFINet detector can significantly improve small object detection performance. The experiments on SODA datasets validate this hypothesis and show state-of-the-art results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing CFINet, a two-stage object detection framework tailored for small object detection. The key ideas are:1. It proposes Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to generate high-quality proposals for small objects. CRPN uses an area-based anchor selection strategy and cascade regression to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals. 2. It introduces a Feature Imitation (FI) branch in the detection head to facilitate learning representations of small instances that perplex the model. The FI branch leverages features of high-quality instances to guide learning of instances with uncertain predictions in an imitation manner. A supervision loss based on contrastive learning is used.3. Integrating CRPN and FI branch with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on small object detection benchmarks SODA-D and SODA-A. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques for detecting small objects.In summary, the main contribution is developing a dedicated two-stage detection framework for small objects, by proposing CRPN for better proposals and FI branch for better features, and showing superior performance on small object benchmarks.
