# [LONEStar: The Lunar Flashlight Optical Navigation Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Lunar Flashlight (LF) was a NASA mission launched in late 2022 that exited Earth-Moon system in May 2023 into a heliocentric orbit after a propulsion anomaly. The spacecraft remained functional otherwise.
- As part of an extended Georgia Tech-led mission, the LONEStar (LF Optical Navigation Experiment with a Star tracker) investigation was conceived to demonstrate optical navigation techniques.

Proposed Solution:  
- LONEStar conducted almost 400 images of star fields, Earth, Moon and 4 planets to demonstrate: 
  1) Instantaneous triangulation using multiple simultaneous planet observations 
  2) Sequential triangulation using rapid observation of multiple planets
  3) Dynamic triangulation using sequential observations over longer timespans
- This included first demonstration of heliocentric navigation using only optical planet observations, including absolute triangulation techniques like the Linear Optimal Sine Triangulation (LOST) algorithm.

Key Contributions:
- Provided first on-orbit validation of recently developed LOST algorithm for instantaneous triangulation. 
- Demonstrated instantaneous localization via triangulation using simultaneous images of Mercury-Mars and Earth-Moon.  
- Showed sequential localization with Jupiter-Saturn using midpoint algorithm.
- Developed initial orbit determination guess via dynamic triangulation on Jupiter-Saturn over 13 days.
- Processed measurements in batch filter to achieve OPNAV-only orbit solutions accurate to ~10 Earth radii using only the planets. Inclusion of Earth-Moon data improved accuracy to 0.3 Earth radii.

In summary, this paper documents the highly successful LONEStar experiment that advanced state-of-the-art in deep space optical navigation through flight demonstrations of new triangulation algorithms and OPNAV techniques using only distant planet observations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper documents the successful demonstration of several optical navigation techniques by Georgia Tech students operating the repurposed Lunar Flashlight spacecraft, including celestial triangulation using images of planets and the Earth-Moon system to estimate the spacecraft's orbit.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper documents the results from the Lunar Flashlight Optical Navigation Experiment with a Star tracker (LONEStar). The main contributions are:

1) LONEStar provides the first on-orbit demonstrations of heliocentric navigation using only optical observations of planets. This includes instantaneous triangulation with simultaneous observations of two planets (Mercury and Mars), sequential triangulation using rapid imaging of two planets (Jupiter and Saturn), and dynamic triangulation using infrequent observations of multiple planets over an extended period of time.

2) LONEStar is the first flight demonstration of celestial triangulation algorithms recently proposed in the literature, including the Linear Optimal Sine Triangulation (LOST) method.

3) LONEStar demonstrates horizon-based optical navigation techniques using images of the Earth and Moon. It provides guidance on handling imaging challenges like optical effects, dynamic range limitations, and changing geometry.

4) LONEStar shows that excellent orbit determination results may be achieved using only optical navigation data. An OPNAV-only batch filter is demonstrated that achieves position errors as low as 0.35 Earth radii over 97 days using images of planets, Earth, and Moon.

In summary, LONEStar advances the state-of-the-art in autonomous optical navigation by providing an on-orbit demonstration of key techniques and algorithms for the first time. The results help validate proposed methods and provide practical lessons for future mission application.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses using both normalized cross-correlation (NCC) with a lunar template and center of brightness (COB) with a phase-dependent correction for generating lunar line-of-sight measurements. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach? Under what conditions might one be preferred over the other?

2. How was the lunar-Lambert model adapted into a usable template for matching against real images? What parameters or rendering techniques could be adjusted to potentially improve the match quality? 

3. The paper compares triangulation algorithms such as the Direct Linear Transform (DLT), midpoint, and Linear Optimal Sine Triangulation (LOST). What are the key assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages of each? When would you select one over the others?

4. What simplifying assumptions were made in generating the dynamic triangulation initial guess? How could a more sophisticated initial guess be generated and what impact might that have on the final solution?

5. The paper assumes the planetary ephemeris positions are perfect and known exactly. What would be the impact if the ephemeris had some uncertainty? How could that be modeled?  

6. What potential improvements could be made to the star detection, attitude determination, or image calibration pipelines? What is the sensitivity of the overall result to errors in those subsystems?

7. The paper models the acceleration due to solar radiation pressure during orbit determination. What other perturbations could be included? What is their expected magnitude and impact?

8. What changes would need to be made to implement this method in real-time onboard the spacecraft instead of on the ground post-facto? What hardware or algorithms would limit the feasibility?

9. How was the measurement noise covariance determined? What other methods could be used to estimate or tune this parameter and what would be the pros and cons?

10. The paper demonstrates sequential imaging of Jupiter and Saturn for triangulation. Why were these planets selected? What other planet combinations could be used and what geometry considerations are most important?
