# [Towards Vision Enhancing LLMs: Empowering Multimodal Knowledge Storage   and Sharing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15759)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MKS2, a novel approach for empowering large language models (LLMs) with the abilities to store and utilize multimodal knowledge, specifically visual information. The authors introduce a Modular Visual Memory (MVM) component integrated into LLM blocks to efficiently store open-world visual data. Through image-to-text generation and text-to-image retrieval training strategies, the MVM comprehends and memorizes visual concepts using a linguistic framework. Additionally, a soft Mixtures-of-Multimodal Experts (MoMEs) architecture is presented to enable seamless collaboration between the visual and textual knowledge within LLMs during text generation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superior reasoning abilities on text-only tasks requiring physical commonsense, while still achieving competitive multimodal understanding performance. The proposed visual enhancement allows LLMs to incorporate and leverage both visual and textual knowledge without compromising either modality. This work represents an important step towards more capable and versatile LLMs through effectively harnessing multimodal knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MKS2, an approach for empowering multimodal knowledge storage and sharing within large language models through a modular visual memory and mixtures-of-multimodal experts architecture to enhance reasoning capabilities and multimodal understanding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes MKS2, a vision-enhanced learning framework for large language models (LLMs) that enables effective storage and sharing of multimodal knowledge. MKS2 can efficiently handle both multimodal and text-only inputs.

2. MKS2 demonstrates superior performance over traditional supervised fine-tuned LLMs and RLHF tuned LLMs on knowledge-intensive natural language processing tasks.

3. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of the mixtures-of-multimodal-experts architecture in MKS2 that incorporates a visual knowledge expert. This architecture distinctly improves LLM performance beyond conventional supervised fine-tuned LLMs.

4. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal instruction-following data further enhances LLMs' performance on natural language reasoning tasks requiring extensive commonsense knowledge.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective approach to empower LLMs to store and utilize visual knowledge for enhanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities.
