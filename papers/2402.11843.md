# [WildFake: A Large-scale Challenging Dataset for AI-Generated Images   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11843)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the rapid advancement of generative models like GANs and diffusion models, it has become increasingly easy to synthesize highly realistic fake images. This has raised concerns regarding the widespread dissemination of misinformation using such AI-generated fake imagery. Therefore, developing technologies to reliably detect fake images is critical. However, existing datasets for training such detectors tend to have limitations in diversity and scope, constraining generalization capability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents WildFake, a large-scale and hierarchical dataset tailored to train robust fake image detectors with enhanced generalization. WildFake contains over 3.6 million images, including 1 million real images and 2.6 million fake images produced by diverse generators ranging from GANs, diffusion models to others like VAEs. The core strengths of WildFake are:

(1) Diverse content collected from open communities, encompassing various categories, styles and quality levels. This wild, varied nature aids generalization.  

(2) Hierarchical structure based on generator type, architecture, model weights and versions. This multi-level organization enables in-depth analysis.

(3) Comprehensive real image collection from diverse datasets to match content diversity.

Contributions:

- Construction of a large-scale hierarchical fake image dataset from open sources with exceptional diversity.

- Superior generalization capability demonstrated through extensive experiments using WildFake and baseline datasets. ViT detector trained on WildFake achieved 89% average accuracy.

- Detailed analyses like cross-generator, cross-architecture evaluation enabled by hierarchical structure, offering insights into different generators.

- Assessment of detection robustness against image degradations like blur, low resolution etc. ViT detector showed resilience.

In summary, WildFake pushes boundaries of existing datasets via its scale, diversity and structure. Experiments exhibit its ability to enhance generalization and robustness for fake image detection.
