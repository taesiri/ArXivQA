# [Question-Instructed Visual Descriptions for Zero-Shot Video Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Video question answering (video QA) is challenging as video possesses multiple frames with relationships and requires recognizing objects, actions, semantic, temporal, causal reasoning etc.  
- Current video QA methods rely on complex architectures, computationally expensive pipelines or closed models like GPTs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Q-ViD, a simple and gradient-free approach for zero-shot video QA that turns it into a text QA task using frame descriptions.
- It uses an instruction-aware vision-language model, InstructBLIP, to generate rich question-dependent captions from video frames. 
- These captions are concatenated to form a video description which is fed along with the question and options to a reasoning module based on a large language model (LLM) that performs the final QA.

Key Contributions:
- Q-ViD relies only on a single instruction-aware open vision-language model to tackle videoQA using frame descriptions. 
- It creates captioning prompts using the target video QA questions to obtain useful frame captions from InstructBLIP.
- The simple Q-ViD framework achieves competitive or even higher performance than complex state-of-the-art models on diverse videoQA benchmarks.
- It does not rely on complex pipelines, closed GPT models, expensive training regimes or multiple modules unlike other methods.

In summary, the key idea is to transform video QA into text QA by creating question-specific visual descriptions of frames using an instruction-tuned multimodal model. The simple and gradient-free Q-ViD approach then performs competitively to more complex methods for zero-shot video QA.
