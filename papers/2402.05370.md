# [Attention as Robust Representation for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Time series forecasting is an important problem with many applications, but faces challenges due to noise and non-stationary distributions in the data. Recent transformer models have shown promise for time series, but rely on patching/segmentation methods that overlook relationships between neighboring time points. This insufficiently handles noise and rapid distribution shifts.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel time series representation called "AttnEmbed" that utilizes the attention weights themselves as the representation, instead of treating them as a byproduct. This captures relationships between time points to form a robust kernel representation resilient against noise and shifts. Specifically:

- An attention map is created using shared embedding layers within local windows, smoothed with EMA and augmented with global landmarks. The final concatenated attention matrix rows become the embedding.  

- Compared to patching, this preserves local temporal dynamics within windows, while landmarks add global context. Kernel-based attention can also replace traditional similarity measures.

- Empirical experiments on synthetic data verify noise resilience. Theoretical analysis proves attention distances better distinguish data relationships after noise injection.

Main Contributions:

- Attention as robust time series representation, proven empirically and theoretically. Significantly outperforms patching methods.

- State-of-the-art accuracy on real-world forecasting benchmarks, reducing MSE by 3.6% vs prior best. Consistent gains across window sizes.

- Kernel functions effectively replace softmax attention, showing comparable performance.

- Seamless integration as a model-agnostic "plug-in" module to boost various model architectures. Demonstrated with PatchTST and CARD.

The core innovation is elevating attention from a supporting role to the primary time series representation, with kernels and smoothing uniquely tailored to handle noise and shifts. This unveils attention's untapped capability for embedding schemas. The proposed AttnEmbed module is versatile, simple, and delivers new SOTA accuracy.
