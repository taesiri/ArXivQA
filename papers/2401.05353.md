# [ImbaGCD: Imbalanced Generalized Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of Imbalanced Generalized Category Discovery (ImbaGCD). In real-world scenarios, unlabeled data contains images from both known classes (that have labeled data) and unknown/novel classes. Typically, known classes are more frequent than novel classes, following a long-tail distribution. However, existing generalized category discovery (GCD) methods assume a balanced distribution between known and novel classes in the unlabeled data, which is unrealistic. This presents two key challenges: (1) estimating the imbalanced class prior distribution without labels, and (2) mitigating bias towards recognizing more images as belonging to frequent/known classes.

Proposed Solution - ImbaGCD:
The paper proposes a novel optimal transport-based expectation maximization framework called ImbaGCD to address ImbaGCD. The key components are:

1) Estimating class prior distribution: An iterative moving average update mechanism to reliably estimate class priors using model predictions.

2) Pseudo-labeling using Sinkhorn algorithm: Assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled data based on model predictions while matching the estimated class prior distribution. This aligns the labeling distribution to the imbalanced class priors.

3) Contrastive learning objective: Employs a supervised contrastive loss on labeled data and an unsupervised instance-level + prototype-level contrastive loss on unlabeled data to learn robust representations.  

The overall framework alternates between the Sinkhorn-based pseudo-labeling step (E-step) and contrastive representation learning (M-step).

Main Contributions:
- Identifies and formulates the novel and practical problem of Imbalanced GCD (ImbaGCD).
- Proposes ImbaGCD, an effective optimal transport-based framework to address ImbaGCD by estimating and aligning to imbalanced class priors.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets under varying degrees of class imbalance, demonstrating its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ImbaGCD, a novel optimal transport-based expectation maximization framework for generalized category discovery that handles the challenging and practical problem of class imbalance in unlabeled data where known classes are more frequent than unknown ones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called ImbaGCD to address the challenging problem of Imbalanced Generalized Category Discovery (ImbaGCD). Specifically:

1) The paper presents the problem of ImbaGCD, where the distribution of unlabeled data is imbalanced, with known classes being more frequent than unknown classes. This reflects real-world scenarios better compared to previous GCD settings. 

2) The paper proposes the ImbaGCD framework, which is an optimal transport-based expectation maximization approach, to accomplish generalized category discovery by aligning the marginal class prior distribution. It also incorporates a method to systematically estimate the imbalanced class prior distribution.

3) Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ImbaGCD outperforms previous state-of-the-art GCD methods by good margins on benchmark datasets under various imbalanced settings. It also shows competitive performance on balanced and original GCD settings. This indicates ImbaGCD's effectiveness in solving the ImbaGCD problem.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel ImbaGCD framework to address the new ImbaGCD problem, which is shown to be superior over existing methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Imbalanced Generalized Category Discovery (ImbaGCD): The main problem addressed in the paper, referring to an imbalanced distribution of unlabeled data where known classes are more frequent than unknown classes.

- Optimal transport: A key technique used in the paper's proposed method to match the marginal class prior distribution and handle the class imbalance issue. 

- Expectation maximization (EM): The framework used in the paper to iteratively assign pseudo-labels and update the model parameters.

- Sinkhorn algorithm: Used within the EM framework in the E-step to generate pseudo-labels that align with the prior class distribution. 

- Class prior estimation: A mechanism proposed in the paper to systematically estimate the imbalanced class prior distribution under the GCD setup, which is challenging due to the lack of ground truth labels.

- Contrastive learning: Used in the paper to improve model representation by maximizing similarity between positive pairs and minimizing similarity between negative pairs.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around the problem definition, the proposed method, and the techniques used within that method to address class imbalance and effectively perform generalized category discovery.
