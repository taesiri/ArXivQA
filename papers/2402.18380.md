# [UKF-Based Sensor Fusion for Joint-Torque Sensorless Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Torque control is crucial for humanoid robots to achieve robust motion tracking and ensure safe interactions. However, joint torque sensors are often unavailable on humanoids due to space, cost and complexity constraints. 
- Existing torque estimation methods like recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA) have limitations - they are deterministic, cannot handle uncertainties like external contacts, sensor noises and modeling errors well.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel torque estimation approach based on Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) to fuse measurements from distributed joint encoders, force/torque sensors, inertial sensors and motor currents.
- Unlike RNEA, the stochastic filtering nature of UKF explicitly handles noise and nonlinearity to improve estimation accuracy.
- A two-level control architecture is presented with a high-level quadratic programming based controller generating desired torques and a low-level PI feedback controller.

Main Contributions:
- Novel UKF based sensor fusion algorithm for joint torque estimation that is robust to disturbances and uncertainties.
- Integrated into a two-level control architecture to enable torque control on sensorless humanoid robots.
- Validated experimentally on the ergoCub humanoid robot - the approach achieves significantly lower torque tracking errors than RNEA, especially in presence of external contacts.  
- Demonstrated to work well for both joint space and task space control, ensuring stability and task accuracy even when subjected to external forces.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards accurate and robust joint torque estimation to facilitate torque control implementations on sensorless humanoid robots, enabling dynamic movements and safe human-robot interaction capabilities.
