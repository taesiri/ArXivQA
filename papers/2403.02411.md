# [NiNformer: A Network in Network Transformer with Token Mixing Generated   Gating Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Transformers and attention mechanisms have led to major advances in deep learning across domains. However, they are computationally expensive and require large datasets. 
- Many designs attempt to improve efficiency and data requirements, like MLP-Mixer, ConvMixer, Perceiver IO etc. But there is a lack of designs that combine the efficiency of MLP-Mixer with the dynamic information filtering of traditional transformers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Network in Network Transformer (NiNformer) block to replace the standard ViT block. 
- It has two levels - an outer network resembling a Transformer, and an inner network resembling an MLP-Mixer.
- The inner MLP-Mixer network learns to generate a dynamic gating signal by token mixing. This signal then scales the outer network's linear projections dynamically per input, allowing for dynamic behavior without expensive attention.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a new NiNformer block combining efficiency of MLP-Mixer with dynamic gating behavior
- The gating signal generation enhances the typically static MLP-Mixer
- Shows better performance than ViT, MLP-Mixer and LocalViT baselines on image classification over CIFAR and MNIST datasets
- Validates that the dynamic gating of the upstream representation helps circumvent limitations of a standalone MLP-Mixer

The experiments demonstrate that the proposed NiNformer architecture outperforms the baseline architectures of ViT, MLP-Mixer and LocalViT on the image classification task over the CIFAR and MNIST datasets. This shows the potential of using an inner MLP-Mixer network to generate dynamic gating signals for an outer Transformer-resembling network.
