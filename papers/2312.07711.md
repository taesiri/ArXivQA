# [Leveraging Large Language Models to Build and Execute Computational   Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07711)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scientific workflows involve complex data processing and computations, requiring expertise to describe and execute using traditional coding approaches. This creates barriers for domain experts without coding skills. 

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to automatically generate and execute workflow code through natural language interactions. 

- Integrate existing workflow framework Phyloflow with OpenAI's function calling API as initial prototype.

- Outline vision for next-gen ChatGPT-based workflow system with natural language interface for users to describe work, monitor progress, present results. LLMs used as 'agents' to plan, execute, debug workflows across computing infrastructure.

Key Contributions:

- Demonstrate feasibility of using OpenAI function calling API to execute Phyloflow tasks and chain execution of multiple tasks through successive API calls and ID binding.

- Propose architecture for advanced workflow engine using LLMs as 'planner', 'executor', 'debugger' agents to manage execution of complex workflows described in natural language by user.

- Show promising path towards simplifying application of complex computational pipelines for domain experts without coding expertise through human-language interface and LLM workflow agents.

In summary, the paper explores using the emerging capabilities of LLMs for automatic workflow code generation and execution to create more accessible and user-friendly scientific workflow systems for non-programmer domain specialists. A prototype integrates Phyloflow with OpenAI API while a vision is presented for a next-generation ChatGPT-based workflow engine.
