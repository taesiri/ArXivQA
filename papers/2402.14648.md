# [Rethinking Invariance Regularization in Adversarial Training to Improve   Robustness-Accuracy Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14648)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Adversarial training (AT) is the state-of-the-art defense against adversarial attacks, but suffers from a trade-off between robustness and accuracy on clean images. The goal is to learn representations that are both adversarially invariant and preserve discriminative power on clean images, in order to improve this trade-off. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Asymmetrically Representation-regularized Adversarial Training (AR-AT) to address two key issues that hinder representation invariance:

1) Gradient conflict between invariance loss and classification loss due to existence of collapsing solutions where models output constant non-discriminative representations. This is addressed via a stop-gradient operation and predictor MLP inspired by self-supervised learning.

2) Mixture distribution problem from using the same batch norms for both clean and adversarial images. This is addressed with a split batch norm structure.

Main Contributions:

- Identifies two key issues hindering representation invariance: gradient conflict and mixture distribution problem
- Proposes AR-AT incorporating stop-gradient+predictor and split batch norms to address these issues 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in trade-off between robustness and accuracy
- Provides new perspective on success of knowledge distillation methods by relating them to avoiding collapsing solutions and mixture distribution problem

The proposed AR-AT method effectively learns discriminative yet adversarially invariant representations by resolving the gradient conflict and mixture distribution issues. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in improving the robustness-accuracy trade-off. The paper also relates AR-AT to knowledge distillation approaches, providing a new understanding of their relative success.
