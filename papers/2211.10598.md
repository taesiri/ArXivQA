# [LidarGait: Benchmarking 3D Gait Recognition with Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10598)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1. Can 3D point cloud data from LiDAR sensors be effectively utilized for gait recognition, providing more robust and accurate identification compared to traditional camera-based methods? 2. How can we design an effective framework/model architecture to extract discriminative gait features from 3D point clouds for identification, given the different data representation compared to 2D images?3. How significant is the benefit of using precise 3D structural information from LiDAR for gait recognition, compared to camera-based approaches that rely only on 2D silhouettes?4. How does LiDAR-based gait recognition perform on various challenges encountered in unconstrained real-world conditions (occlusions, clothing, viewpoints etc.), compared to camera-based methods?5. Is LiDAR more suitable for gait recognition in outdoor environments compared to traditional RGB cameras?To summarize, the key research focus is on investigating LiDAR for 3D gait recognition, proposing a model architecture to effectively extract gait features from point clouds, and benchmarking its performance against camera-based methods on various real-world conditions using a new large-scale dataset. The overarching hypothesis is that LiDAR provides more robust gait recognition by capturing precise 3D structural information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the main contributions of this paper:1. The paper introduces SUSTech1K, the first large-scale LiDAR-based gait recognition benchmark dataset. It contains 25,239 sequences from 1,050 subjects, captured both by a LiDAR sensor and an RGB camera. The dataset has diverse variations like occlusions, views, carrying objects, clothing changes, etc. 2. The paper proposes a novel LiDAR-based gait recognition method called LidarGait. It projects the 3D point clouds to depth maps and uses CNNs to extract discriminative gait features. Experiments show LidarGait outperforms other point-based and silhouette-based methods significantly.3. The paper provides a comprehensive study and comparison of LiDAR-based and camera-based gait recognition. Experiments demonstrate that LiDAR provides more robust gait features compared to cameras, especially for challenging conditions like nighttime, occlusion, etc. The results highlight the advantages of using 3D information for gait recognition.4. Through ablation studies, the paper validates the importance of 3D geometric information for gait recognition. It also analyzes the impact of different projection views of point clouds.In summary, the main contribution is introducing LiDAR for gait recognition, building a large-scale LiDAR gait benchmark, and proposing an effective LiDAR-based gait recognition method, outperforming prior arts. The paper convincingly demonstrates the practical significance of using LiDAR sensors for gait recognition in the real world.
