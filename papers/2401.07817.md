# [Question Translation Training for Better Multilingual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in English but struggle on non-English languages due to most of their training data being English text and instructions. 
- A common solution is to translate English instruction data into other languages (translate-training), but this is costly, error-prone for translating complex mathematical reasoning text, and doesn't scale as more instruction data is created.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a question alignment (QAlign) method which fine-tunes the LLM to translate non-English questions into English using X-English question pairs.  
- This establishes language alignment within the LLM before exposing it to English instruction-response pairs for further tuning.
- Enables utilizing cutting-edge English-only reasoning data to unlock LLM's multilingual abilities by transferring its English expertise.

Key Contributions:
- Devise a two-stage framework of question alignment then response alignment for efficiently boosting LLM's multilingual reasoning.
- Show that the question translation step leads to large improvements over standard translate-training, improving multilingual accuracy by 9.6-16.1% on math reasoning benchmarks.
- Demonstrate the approach enables consistency in LLM predictions between English and non-English versions of the same question.
- Analyze the impact of alignment direction, domain, and types of translation data.
- Release SOTA open-source multilingual math reasoning models.

In summary, the key novelty is establishing language alignment by teaching the LLM to translate questions before leveraging English reasoning data. This unlocks strong multilingual transfer without requiring costly translation of all instruction data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores question alignment for training large language models to translate reasoning questions into English, enabling effective utilization of English instruction data to improve multilingual reasoning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors present a novel X-English question alignment finetuning step which performs targeted language alignment to best utilize the LLM's English reasoning abilities.

2. They fine-tune two open-source LLMs, LLaMA2-7B/13B, into strong multilingual reasoners, which outperform the translate-training baseline by significant margins on the mGSM and mSVAMP benchmarks. 

3. They explore language alignment with other directions (English-X) and types/domains of data (e.g. CoT responses, FLORES) and confirm that X-English questions perform best for alignment.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a question alignment method to effectively transfer an LLM's reasoning abilities from English to other languages, demonstrating superior performance over translate-training baselines while also being more efficient.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Multilingual mathematical reasoning - The paper focuses on evaluating and improving large language models' ability to reason about mathematical problems posed in multiple languages.

- Question alignment - A key technique proposed in the paper where the model is fine-tuned to translate reasoning questions from non-English languages into English using parallel data. This aligns the model's representations across languages.

- Translate-training - An existing technique that translates English reasoning training data into non-English languages and trains models on the resulting multilingual dataset. The paper compares to this approach.

- LLaMA2 - An open-source large language model used as the base model in experiments. Specifically LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B variants.

- mGSM, mSVAMP - Multilingual mathematical reasoning benchmarks used to evaluate model performance.

- Instruction tuning - Fine-tuning technique to specialize LLMs for certain tasks/responses based on instruction-response example pairs. Used in the paper to adapt models for mathematical reasoning after question alignment.

- Transfer learning - Question alignment enables transfer of the model's mathematical reasoning abilities from English to other languages.

So in summary, key terms cover the multilingual reasoning setup and datasets, the proposed question alignment technique, baseline approaches like translate-training, the LLMs and tuning procedures used, and notions of transfer learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage training framework involving question alignment followed by response alignment. Why is establishing language alignment critical before exposing the model to English instruction-response pairs? How does this enable transfer of reasoning abilities?

2. The paper argues that translating lengthy chain-of-thought responses with mathematical symbols is challenging. How does the proposed question alignment approach avoid this issue? What specific advantages does using only a question translation task provide? 

3. For the question alignment stage, the paper explores using different translation directions (X->En vs En->X) and different data domains (questions vs responses vs general text). What effects do these choices have on downstream multilingual reasoning performance and why?

4. How does the model architecture and training process differ between the question alignment stage and response alignment stage? Why are two separate stages needed instead of joint training?

5. The model is only trained on English reasoning data in the response alignment stage. What specifically enables this English knowledge to transfer to non-English tasks after question alignment? How is this transfer demonstrated empirically?

6. For the mixed supervision setting, how does additional multilingual data augmentation provide further performance gains? What are the limitations of relying solely on English data versus utilizing some translated multilingual data?

7. The paper argues question alignment is superior to the translate-test approach at inference time. Why does explicitly translating questions not help for untrained models? What efficiency advantages exist for question alignment models instead?

8. How consistent are the reasoning chains and predictions when posing the same semantic question in multiple languages? How specifically does question alignment improve cross-lingual consistency compared to baseline approaches? 

9. What types of mathematical reasoning abilities transfer best or worst cross-lingually after question alignment training? Are there observable patterns in where models still struggle to generalize?

10. The approach relies on a language-aligned foundation model. How do results vary when using different sized or architecture foundation models? What are the limitations of the alignment approach for lower-resource languages?
