# [The I/O Complexity of Attention, or How Optimal is Flash Attention?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Self-attention is critical for Transformers but suffers from quadratic time and memory complexity. 
- FlashAttention proposes an I/O-aware self-attention algorithm with I/O complexity $O(N^2d^2/M)$ using two memory levels - fast cache for computation and slow memory for storage.
- This leaves open the question of whether FlashAttention I/O complexity is optimal for any cache size M.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper resolves the above open question by proving matching upper and lower bounds. 
- For standard matrix multiplication, it shows the I/O complexity is $\Theta(\min(\frac{N^2d}{\sqrt{M}}, \frac{N^2d^2}{M}))$, answering the open question.
- For any matrix multiplication algorithm, it shows a lower bound of $\Omega(\min(\frac{N^2d^2}{M}, N^2))$ for $M≥d^2$, matching FlashAttention.  
- The key ideas involve:
   - Using the red-blue pebble game to analyze standard matrix multiplication algorithms.
   - Introducing a new communication complexity problem for matrix compression and relating it to I/O complexity to prove lower bounds against any algorithm.
   - Leveraging coding theory and Vandermonde matrices to construct hard instances.

Main Contributions:
- Resolves the open question on optimality of FlashAttention I/O complexity.
- Provides tight I/O complexity bounds for self-attention using standard matrix multiplication.
- Proves first I/O lower bounds against algorithms using fast matrix multiplication.
- Establishes an intriguing connection between communication complexity and I/O complexity.
- The lower bounds hold even for binary matrices using ideas from coding theory.
- For small cache size $M ≤ d^2$, the I/O complexity is shown to be equivalent to matrix multiplication.

In summary, the paper makes important theoretical contributions in determining optimal I/O algorithms for self-attention in Transformers, utilizing a diverse set of techniques.
