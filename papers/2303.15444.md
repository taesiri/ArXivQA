# [Quantum Multi-Model Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15444)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can multi-model fitting problems be formulated to leverage the potential of adiabatic quantum computers?The authors propose a quantum approach to multi-model fitting, which is an important computer vision problem with many applications like 3D reconstruction, face clustering, etc. The key ideas are:- They formulate multi-model fitting as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that can be efficiently sampled by adiabatic quantum computers. - They introduce a quantum method called QuMF that handles fitting multiple disjoint models without needing to know the number of models a priori.- They also propose an iterative decomposed version called DeQuMF that can scale to large problem sizes by partitioning the problem.So in summary, the main research contribution is introducing the first quantum approach to multi-model fitting and formulating it in a way that is suitable for adiabatic quantum optimization. The central hypothesis seems to be that quantum computing can provide benefits for this complex combinatorial problem. The formulations and experiments aim to demonstrate the potential of their proposed quantum methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper is proposing the first quantum approach to multi-model fitting (MMF), called QuMF. The key points are:- They formulate MMF as a problem that can be efficiently sampled by modern adiabatic quantum computers without relaxing the objective function.- They propose an iterative and decomposed version called DeQuMF to support large-scale real-world problems. - Experiments demonstrate promising results on various datasets compared to classical and quantum baselines.In summary, the main contribution is bringing multi-model fitting, an important computer vision problem, into the realm of adiabatic quantum computing and showing strong results. The proposed QuMF and DeQuMF are the first quantum methods for handling multiple models in fitting problems.
