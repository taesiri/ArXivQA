# [Quantum Multi-Model Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15444)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can multi-model fitting problems be formulated to leverage the potential of adiabatic quantum computers?The authors propose a quantum approach to multi-model fitting, which is an important computer vision problem with many applications like 3D reconstruction, face clustering, etc. The key ideas are:- They formulate multi-model fitting as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that can be efficiently sampled by adiabatic quantum computers. - They introduce a quantum method called QuMF that handles fitting multiple disjoint models without needing to know the number of models a priori.- They also propose an iterative decomposed version called DeQuMF that can scale to large problem sizes by partitioning the problem.So in summary, the main research contribution is introducing the first quantum approach to multi-model fitting and formulating it in a way that is suitable for adiabatic quantum optimization. The central hypothesis seems to be that quantum computing can provide benefits for this complex combinatorial problem. The formulations and experiments aim to demonstrate the potential of their proposed quantum methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper is proposing the first quantum approach to multi-model fitting (MMF), called QuMF. The key points are:- They formulate MMF as a problem that can be efficiently sampled by modern adiabatic quantum computers without relaxing the objective function.- They propose an iterative and decomposed version called DeQuMF to support large-scale real-world problems. - Experiments demonstrate promising results on various datasets compared to classical and quantum baselines.In summary, the main contribution is bringing multi-model fitting, an important computer vision problem, into the realm of adiabatic quantum computing and showing strong results. The proposed QuMF and DeQuMF are the first quantum methods for handling multiple models in fitting problems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of quantum multi-model fitting:The key innovation of this paper is proposing the first quantum approach to multi-model fitting (MMF) using adiabatic quantum computers (AQCs). MMF is an important problem in computer vision with many applications, but prior quantum methods like HQC-RF focused only on single model fitting. The authors formulate MMF as a combinatorial optimization problem that can be expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and solved using an AQC. This allows exploiting the advantages of quantum computing for a problem with an exponential search space.Compared to classical MMF methods like RANSAC and RANSAC-based approaches, the proposed quantum method does not require knowing the number of models a priori and can find the globally optimal solution. The authors propose both a single-QUBO approach (QuMF) and a decomposed iterative approach (DeQuMF) for larger problems.The proposed methods are evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to classical methods like RANSACov and the quantum single model fitting method HQC-RF. The decomposed approach DeQuMF is shown to scale well. Overall, this paper makes an important contribution in bringing a highly relevant computer vision problem into the realm of quantum computing. The comparative evaluation provides evidence that quantum methods can offer benefits for MMF. More broadly, it expands the applicability of quantum computing to larger combinatorial optimization problems in computer vision.
