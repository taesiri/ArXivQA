# [From LLM to Conversational Agent: A Memory Enhanced Architecture with   Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 into conversational agents is challenging. LLMs exhibit high performance in isolated tasks but struggle to sustain coherent, context-aware dialogues.  
- Existing frameworks lack capabilities to maintain conversation history, continuity, and adaptability across complex, multi-turn interactions.

Proposed Solution - RAISE Architecture:  
- Enhances integration of LLMs into conversational agents, building on the ReAct framework.
- Incorporates a dual-component memory system - a scratchpad to maintain dialogue context, and a retrieval module to source relevant examples. This mirrors human short-term and long-term memory.
- Follows a structured scenario for agent construction: Conversation Selection, Scene Extraction, Chain of Thought (CoT) Completion, Scene Augmentation, and LLMs Training. 
- Aims to enhance agent controllability, adaptability and effectiveness in conversations.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces RAISE, an advanced architecture using scratchpad and examples to augment capabilities of conversational agents.
- Proposes a fine-tuning method to enhance control and efficiency of agents based on RAISE, especially for domain-specific applications like real estate sales conversations.  
- Demonstrates through experiments that RAISE agents perform better than traditional agents in complex, multi-turn dialogues, indicating potential for wider applications.
- Provides a robust framework to develop more context-aware and versatile conversational agents using LLMs.

In summary, the paper presents RAISE, an architecture using memory components and fine-tuning to integrate LLMs more effectively into conversational agents. Evaluations show performance gains, highlighting its potential to enable more adaptable dialogue agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces RAISE, an enhanced architecture for integrating Large Language Models like GPT-4 into conversational agents, which uses a dual-component memory system and a structured fine-tuning approach to improve context retention, continuity, controllability and efficiency in complex, multi-turn dialogues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of the RAISE (Reasoning and Acting through Scratchpad and Examples) architecture, which is an enhancement of the ReAct framework. RAISE utilizes a dual-component memory system with a scratchpad and retrieved examples to augment the capabilities of conversational agents.

2. A proposed fine-tuning method within RAISE for Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4. Compared to using prompts alone, this enhances the controllability of the agent and also improves its effectiveness and efficiency. 

3. Experimental evaluations conducted on an in-house dataset focused on real estate sales conversations, demonstrating RAISE's superiority over traditional conversational agents. This indicates its potential for application in broader domains, beyond real estate.

In summary, the main contribution is the RAISE architecture and associated fine-tuning methodology to develop more context-aware, adaptable, and controllable conversational agents by enhancing integration of LLMs like GPT-4. The experimental results provide initial validation of RAISE's capabilities.
