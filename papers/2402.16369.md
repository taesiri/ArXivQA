# [Generative AI in Vision: A Survey on Models, Metrics and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on generative AI diffusion models and their applications in computer vision. 

The paper first gives background on generative models in computer vision, tracing their evolution from early statistical models like HMMs and GMMs to recent deep learning based approaches like GANs, VAEs, autoregressive models, normalizing flows, and energy based models. It then dives deeper into diffusion models, explaining concepts like denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), noise conditional score models, and stochastic differential equation (SDE) based generative models.  

The paper summarizes key generative model evaluation metrics like Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, precision, and recall. It also explores diverse applications of diffusion models in computer vision, like unconditional image generation, text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, image anomaly detection, and image inpainting. For text-to-image generation, the paper compares different conditional diffusion models like GLIDE, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E2, Imagen, and others on metrics like FID score.  

The main contributions of the paper are providing an up-to-date overview of generative vision models, an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art diffusion techniques, highlighting current research gaps, and laying out future research directions to advance innovations in this rapidly evolving field.

The paper concludes by noting that despite the promising capabilities of diffusion models, challenges remain around training stability, scalability, and interpretability. It encourages future work to address these challenges in order to unlock the full potential of diffusion models in generating diverse, realistic, and ethically-conscious synthetic data.
