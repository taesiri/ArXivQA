# [Accelerating Transducers through Adjacent Token Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16009)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is how to reduce computation and accelerate inference for end-to-end automatic speech recognition systems based on Transformer transducers, without sacrificing accuracy. The key hypothesis seems to be that gradually combining adjacent encoder tokens with high similarity between their key values can reduce sequence length and redundancy, thereby improving efficiency, while still preserving the information needed for accurate speech recognition.Specifically, the proposed approach called Adjacent Token Merging (A-ToMe) aims to adaptively subsample the acoustic tokens within the Transformer transducer encoder in order to reduce computational costs, especially for long speech inputs. This is in contrast to prior work that uses fixed subsampling rates.So in summary, the main research question is how to improve encoder efficiency in Transformer transducer ASR through a novel adaptive subsampling technique, with the hypothesis that merging highly similar adjacent tokens can reduce computation while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Adjacent Token Merging (A-ToMe) to reduce the number of tokens in the encoder of Transformer transducers for automatic speech recognition. The key ideas are:- A-ToMe module merges adjacent tokens with high similarity between their key values to achieve an adaptive frame rate. - Two merging strategies are introduced: fixed merge ratio and fixed merge threshold, to handle varying input lengths.- Experiments show A-ToMe can reduce tokens significantly (e.g. 57%) and accelerate inference on CPU (up to 70%) and GPU (up to 35%) with minimal impact on word error rate.- A-ToMe is effective for long-form ASR where input consists of concatenated utterances, reducing computational cost.- Model trained with fixed threshold can adapt to different thresholds during inference, enabling on-demand token reduction.In summary, the main contribution is proposing A-ToMe for efficient and accelerated end-to-end speech recognition while maintaining accuracy. The key aspects are the adaptive merging approach and flexibility it provides.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called Adjacent Token Merging that gradually combines similar adjacent tokens in the Transformer encoder to reduce sequence length and accelerate inference for end-to-end speech recognition without significant loss in accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research on adaptive subsampling methods for ASR:- Most prior work has focused on fixed-rate subsampling using convolutional layers, which can be suboptimal since acoustic unit durations vary. This paper proposes a novel adaptive technique called Adjacent Token Merging (A-ToMe) that gradually merges tokens with high similarity. - A few other papers have explored adaptive techniques, but rely on explicitly predicting boundaries or separate boundary/pooling modules. The proposed A-ToMe method does not predict boundaries, and simply merges similar adjacent tokens to achieve variable frame rates.- Many adaptive techniques are evaluated only on classification tasks. This paper demonstrates A-ToMe for a sequence-to-sequence ASR task, showing strong speedups on LibriSpeech with minimal WER degradation.- The paper further shows A-ToMe is very useful for long-form ASR, where concatenating utterances greatly increases encoder computation. A-ToMe provides much larger speed gains as the sequences get longer.- Unlike most prior work, this paper also explores inference-time adaptation by adjusting the merge threshold without retraining. This could enable on-demand compute reduction in the future.Overall, this paper presents a simple yet effective new approach to adaptive subsampling that is tailored for ASR. The experiments on both short and long-form speech highlight the benefits over fixed subsampling and other adaptive methods. The ability to adjust merging during inference is also novel and could open up new research directions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the authors do not explicitly suggest specific future research directions. However, some potential future work that could build on this research includes:- Exploring more sophisticated token merging strategies beyond just adjacent tokens. The authors mention this as something they plan to investigate. This could involve merging non-adjacent tokens in a way that still preserves temporal order.- Adapting the approach for streaming/online ASR. The authors mention they will adapt their method for this setting, which requires modifications to enable incremental processing. - Applying the method to other sequence modeling tasks beyond just ASR, such as machine translation or language modeling. The core idea of merging redundant tokens could be relevant in other domains.- Combining the adaptive subsampling approach with other methods like knowledge distillation or quantization to further improve efficiency. There may be complementary benefits.- Developing more advanced on-demand inference capabilities, where the model can dynamically adjust computations in response to changing requirements. The preliminary on-demand experiments provide a good starting point.- Exploring the use of learned thresholds or merge ratios, instead of pre-defined configurations. This could allow more flexible control over the subsampling rate.Overall, the core idea of progressively merging acoustic tokens shows promise for improving ASR efficiency. There are many interesting ways this approach could be extended and refined in future work.
