# [Accelerating Transducers through Adjacent Token Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16009)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is how to reduce computation and accelerate inference for end-to-end automatic speech recognition systems based on Transformer transducers, without sacrificing accuracy. The key hypothesis seems to be that gradually combining adjacent encoder tokens with high similarity between their key values can reduce sequence length and redundancy, thereby improving efficiency, while still preserving the information needed for accurate speech recognition.Specifically, the proposed approach called Adjacent Token Merging (A-ToMe) aims to adaptively subsample the acoustic tokens within the Transformer transducer encoder in order to reduce computational costs, especially for long speech inputs. This is in contrast to prior work that uses fixed subsampling rates.So in summary, the main research question is how to improve encoder efficiency in Transformer transducer ASR through a novel adaptive subsampling technique, with the hypothesis that merging highly similar adjacent tokens can reduce computation while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Adjacent Token Merging (A-ToMe) to reduce the number of tokens in the encoder of Transformer transducers for automatic speech recognition. The key ideas are:- A-ToMe module merges adjacent tokens with high similarity between their key values to achieve an adaptive frame rate. - Two merging strategies are introduced: fixed merge ratio and fixed merge threshold, to handle varying input lengths.- Experiments show A-ToMe can reduce tokens significantly (e.g. 57%) and accelerate inference on CPU (up to 70%) and GPU (up to 35%) with minimal impact on word error rate.- A-ToMe is effective for long-form ASR where input consists of concatenated utterances, reducing computational cost.- Model trained with fixed threshold can adapt to different thresholds during inference, enabling on-demand token reduction.In summary, the main contribution is proposing A-ToMe for efficient and accelerated end-to-end speech recognition while maintaining accuracy. The key aspects are the adaptive merging approach and flexibility it provides.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called Adjacent Token Merging that gradually combines similar adjacent tokens in the Transformer encoder to reduce sequence length and accelerate inference for end-to-end speech recognition without significant loss in accuracy.
