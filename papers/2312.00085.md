# [X-Dreamer: Creating High-quality 3D Content by Bridging the Domain Gap   Between Text-to-2D and Text-to-3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00085)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes X-Dreamer, an innovative text-to-3D generation framework that bridges the domain gap between text-to-2D and text-to-3D synthesis. A core challenge is that existing text-to-3D methods directly employ pretrained 2D diffusion models which lack inherent linkage to essential 3D-specific attributes like camera perspectives. To address this, X-Dreamer incorporates two key modules - Camera-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (CG-LoRA) and Attention-Mask Alignment (AMA) loss. CG-LoRA dynamically incorporates camera parameters into the 2D diffusion model via generated low-rank matrices, enhancing alignment with camera viewpoints. The AMA loss guides the attention map using the 3D asset's binary mask to prioritize precise foreground object generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate X-Dreamer's superiority over state-of-the-art text-to-3D approaches in producing detailed 3D assets within reasonable optimization times. The key innovations of dynamically integrating camera information and directing attention to foreground object generation enable X-Dreamer to effectively bridge the text-to-2D and text-to-3D domain gap.
