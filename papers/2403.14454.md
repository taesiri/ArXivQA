# [Prediction of Translation Techniques for the Translation Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation systems still produce lower quality translations compared to humans. Issues like word-for-word translation, false friends, ambiguity, information omission/addition, and cultural insensitivity persist. 
- Inappropriate translation techniques are a major cause of low quality machine translations. Humans rely on various translation techniques to ensure linguistic adequacy and fluency, but current MT systems do not explicitly model human translators' decisions on techniques.

Proposed Solution:
- Translation techniques can serve as a guide for optimizing machine translation. But first it's necessary to automatically predict suitable techniques from the source text. 
- The paper investigates predicting techniques for two scenarios - from-scratch translation and post-editing. For each scenario tailored experiments are devised using pre-trained cross-lingual models like mBERT, mBART and mT5.

Key Contributions:
- Created a labeled English-Chinese parallel corpus with aligned units and their translation techniques. Made data and codes publicly available.
- For from-scratch translation, achieved up to 81.9% accuracy in predicting translation techniques only from source texts. 
- For post-editing, achieved over 90% accuracy in identifying poor translations and suggesting techniques to fix them.
- Demonstrated feasibility of automatically predicting translation techniques to guide machine translation, both for from-scratch and post-editing scenarios. This can enable future advances.

In summary, the paper makes useful progress towards enabling machine translation systems to model human translator's use of diverse translation techniques. This can help address persisting quality issues in MT output.
