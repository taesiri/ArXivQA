# [Learning the Visualness of Text Using Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10434)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we automatically quantify the visualness (imageability) of text at the sentence level, and adapt vision-language models to distinguish visual sentences from non-visual ones given only text input? The key points are:- The paper introduces the task of predicting sentence-level visualness (imageability), which is important for applications like selecting relevant sentences to generate/retrieve images for. - The authors curate a new dataset TImeD of sentences labeled for visualness through crowdsourcing.- They propose a fine-tuning strategy to adapt vision-language models like CLIP to classify sentence visualness from text input alone, by contrasting visual text with actual images and non-visual text with a "NULL" image.- Experiments show their proposed TIP-CLIP model outperforms several baselines in accurately categorizing sentences as visual/non-visual. Analyses also demonstrate TIP-CLIP's utility for downstream generation.So in summary, the core research question is how to quantify sentence-level visualness and adapt vision-language models for this text-only task, which the paper addresses through a new labeled dataset and fine-tuning strategy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to quantify the "visualness" or "imageability" of text at the sentence level. Specifically:- The authors curate two new datasets: 1) TImeD - a dataset of 3,620 English sentences annotated with visualness scores by multiple human raters. 2) A distantly supervised corpus of 48,077 text-image pairs automatically extracted from documents, with visual sentences matched to corresponding images and non-visual sentences matched to a common "NULL" image.- They propose a fine-tuning strategy to adapt vision-language models like CLIP to the task of scoring sentence visualness from text alone, without needing accompanying images at test time. This involves modifying the contrastive learning objective to map visual text to images and non-visual text to the NULL image. - They evaluate the proposed approach on classifying sentences as visual/non-visual and find it outperforms several baselines including heuristic methods and a fine-tuned BERT classifier.- Analyses show the adapted model attends more to visual words and produces embeddings that remain useful for downstream image retrieval, unlike an alternate training formulation.- Qualitative examples demonstrate the model's utility for improving text-to-image generation.Overall, the key contribution is developing a practical method to quantify sentence-level visualness using vision-language models, which could enable better integration of text and images in documents. The new datasets and analyses also provide useful resources for future research on this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes quantifying the visualness (imageability) of text sentences, curates human-annotated and distantly labeled datasets, adapts vision-language models like CLIP to distinguish visual from non-visual text input, and shows the utility of modeling text visualness for improving text-to-image generation.
