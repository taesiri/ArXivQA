# [HistGen: Histopathology Report Generation via Local-Global Feature   Encoding and Cross-modal Context Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05396)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Histopathology serves as the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, with clinical reports being vital for interpretation, guiding treatment and patient care. However, report writing by pathologists is labor-intensive, time-consuming and error-prone. 
- Automated histopathology report generation faces challenges like lack of benchmark datasets, gigapixel size of whole slide images (WSIs), contrast between visual and textual modalities, and reliance on multiple instance learning (MIL) with pre-trained feature extractors acting as bottlenecks.

Proposed Solution - HistGen:
- Curates first benchmark WSI-report dataset with ~7,800 pairs by building a report collection and cleaning pipeline from TCGA.

- Proposes a MIL-empowered framework for histopathology report generation with two key modules:
  - Local-Global Hierarchical Encoder: Efficiently aggregates visual features from a region-to-slide perspective to capture both local and global information.
  - Cross-Modal Context Module: Enables explicit alignment and interaction between visual and textual modalities.  

- Pre-trains a DINOv2 ViT-L feature extractor on 55,000+ WSIs to boost encoding.

- Model can be fine-tuned for cancer subtyping and survival analysis, showing strong transfer learning capability.

Main Contributions:
- First curated benchmark WSI-report dataset with ~7,800 pairs
- Local-global hierarchical encoder for efficient visual feature aggregation 
- Cross-modal context module for explicit vision-language alignment
- Pre-trained DINOv2 ViT-L feature extractor that outperforms prior works
- Extensive experiments showing superiority over state-of-the-art on report generation and down-stream tasks

The key novelty lies in efficiently harnessing multi-granularity visual information and cross-modal interactions for superior automated histopathology report generation.
