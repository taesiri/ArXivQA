# [MM-SurvNet: Deep Learning-Based Survival Risk Stratification in Breast   Cancer Through Multimodal Data Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework called MM-SurvNet for survival risk stratification in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Survival risk prediction is important for clinical decision making and treatment selections for breast cancer patients. However, traditional methods based primarily on clinicopathological factors are limited in capturing the heterogeneity and complex biology of breast cancer. 

To address this, the paper leverages multiple data modalities - whole slide histopathology images, genetic profiles, and clinical data. The images provide visual information on tumor morphology. Genetic data from RNA sequencing offers insights on gene expression patterns. Clinical variables like tumor grade and lymph node status also influence prognosis predictions.

The proposed MM-SurvNet architecture employs a vision transformer called MaxViT to extract visual features from histopathology images. A self-attention mechanism then aggregates image patch-level features into a compact patient-level representation. This compressed vector highlights significant regions in images while preserving inter-patch contexts. 

Furthermore, a dual cross-attention mechanism fuses the image embedding vector with genetic profiles. By allowing attention flows in both directions, this captures intermodal dependencies and extracts the most relevant features from each modality. Finally, clinical variables are incorporated as additional inputs to enhance prediction.

Experiments on the TCGA breast cancer dataset demonstrate superior performance over models using single data types, with a C-index of 0.64 for survival prediction. Kaplan-Meier analysis also shows effective stratification of patients into high and low risk groups. By integrating histopathology images, genetics and clinical data, MM-SurvNet facilitates more accurate risk prognostication to guide treatment decisions for ER+ breast cancer.
