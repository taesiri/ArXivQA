# [Benchmarking LLMs via Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current LLM evaluation platforms like HuggingFace leaderboard only use accuracy, neglecting model uncertainty which is crucial for thoroughly assessing LLMs. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new benchmarking approach that integrates uncertainty quantification using conformal prediction. Evaluates 8 LLMs across 5 tasks formatted as multiple choice questions.

- Propose a new metric called UAcc that considers both accuracy and uncertainty.

Key Findings:
- LLMs with higher accuracy can exhibit lower certainty.

- Larger LLMs may show greater uncertainty than smaller counterparts. 

- Instruction-finetuning tends to increase LLM uncertainty.

- By accounting for uncertainty, the proposed UAcc metric can amplify or diminish an LLM's relative improvement over another and even change their ranking.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive benchmarking of LLMs incorporating uncertainty.

- Demonstrates significance of uncertainty for evaluating LLMs beyond just accuracy.

- Introduces new UAcc metric integrating accuracy and uncertainty.

In summary, this paper highlights the importance of uncertainty quantification for thoroughly assessing LLMs. The proposed benchmarking methodology and UAcc metric enable more nuanced comparisons of LLM performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes benchmarking large language models via uncertainty quantification using conformal prediction, evaluates multiple LLMs across various natural language tasks, and introduces a new uncertainty-aware evaluation metric UAcc that considers both accuracy and uncertainty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes using conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in large language models (LLMs). The key contributions are:

1) It benchmarks eight LLMs across five typical NLP tasks by transforming them into multiple choice questions. The tasks include question answering, reading comprehension, commonsense inference, dialogue response selection, and document summarization.

2) It reveals several findings through a comprehensive evaluation:
- LLMs with higher accuracy may exhibit greater uncertainty
- Larger LLMs tend to show higher uncertainty than smaller counterparts  
- Instruction-finetuning increases uncertainty in LLMs

3) It introduces a new evaluation metric called UAcc that incorporates both accuracy and uncertainty. This metric can amplify or reduce the relative improvement of one LLM compared to another.

4) The results underscore the importance of considering uncertainty in addition to accuracy when evaluating and comparing LLMs. The paper argues that relying solely on accuracy is insufficient for thoroughly benchmarking LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is highlighting the significance of uncertainty quantification through a rigorous examination of multiple LLMs across diverse tasks. The paper proposes conformal prediction as an effective and practical means to achieve this.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed UAcc metric balance prediction accuracy and uncertainty to provide a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs compared to solely using accuracy? What are the unique advantages and potential limitations of this metric?

2. The paper employs conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. What are the key benefits of using conformal prediction over other uncertainty quantification methods like Bayesian inference when evaluating LLMs? What practical challenges remain?  

3. The study transforms all tasks into a multiple choice format to enable uncertainty evaluation. What are possible approaches to quantify uncertainty for the generative capabilities of LLMs? What remains difficult or impossible with current methods?

4. How does the choice of conformal score function like LAC and APS impact the prediction sets and uncertainty estimates produced by conformal prediction? What are the tradeoffs between these score functions?  

5. What do the results suggesting increased uncertainty for larger LLMs imply about the relationship between scale and uncertainty? How might this affect the development and usage of ever-larger foundation models?

6. Why does instruction tuning appear to increase uncertainty in many cases? Does this suggest potential issues with instruction tuning that need to be addressed?

7. Could the findings regarding uncertainty provide insight into topics like model calibration, overconfidence, compositionality, causal reasoning, or adversarial robustness for LLMs? If so, how?  

8. How sensitive are the uncertainty measurements using conformal prediction to factors like prompt design, calibration set size, softmax temperature, and conformity score parameters? How can this sensitivity be addressed?  

9. The study only evaluates language tasks, but many LLMs are becoming multimodal. What additional challenges arise for uncertainty quantification in multimodal capabilities of LLMs?

10. How could the benchmarking methodology proposed here be extended to a larger set of diverse LLMs and tasks? What data efficiency innovations could make this more scalable?
