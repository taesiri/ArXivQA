# [Promptly Predicting Structures: The Return of Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06877)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Structured prediction tasks require making multiple interdependent decisions that constrain each other. These tasks are common in NLP but annotating data for them is difficult and expensive. 
- Recently, prompt-based methods have shown promise for text classification/generation in low-resource scenarios. However, using prompts for structured outputs is still largely unexplored.
- Simply breaking down the structure into components and getting predictions from prompts ignores structural constraints leading to invalid outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a framework to construct zero- and few-shot structure predictors using prompts and inference. 
- Break down task into prompt-friendly subtasks to get scored candidates from LLMs.  
- Feed scores to inference algorithms like ILPs or graph optimization to produce globally consistent structures.
- Inference acts as a correction mechanism over the independent prompt-based predictions.

Key Contributions:
- Novel idea of reintroducing inference, a key aspect of structured prediction, into the prompting paradigm. 
- Instantiate the framework on semantic role labeling and coreference resolution tasks.
- Show that enforcing consistency not only outputs valid structures, but also improves overall performance. 
- Demonstrate promise of prompts for structured tasks without needing any training data.
- Analysis over model sizes and shots establishes broad applicability of the framework.

In summary, the paper makes structured prediction amenable to the prompting paradigm by using inference over prompt-based predictions. This allows exploiting recent advances in LLMs for structured NLP without requiring expensive annotations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a framework for predicting structurally consistent outputs for structured prediction tasks in a zero- to few-shot setting by using prompts to generate candidate structures and combinatorial inference to filter out invalid ones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework for predicting structurally valid outputs for structured prediction tasks in a zero- to few-shot setting using language models and inference. The key ideas are:

1) Breaking down the structured prediction task into prompt-friendly components (e.g. questions for each output element).

2) Using language models to generate scored outputs for each component based on the prompts. 

3) Employing inference algorithms to combine the component predictions into globally consistent structures that satisfy structural constraints.

4) Showing that this framework can work in a zero-shot setting without any labeled training data, or few-shot by providing a few examples.

5) Demonstrating the framework on semantic role labeling and coreference resolution tasks, where enforcing consistency with inference not only outputs valid structures, but also improves performance over unconstrained variants.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a general prompt-inference framework to predict structurally valid outputs on structured prediction problems in low resource scenarios by exploiting recent advances in language model prompting.

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Prompt-based methods
- Few-shot learning
- Zero-shot learning

The paper presents a framework to adapt prompt-based methods for few-shot structured prediction tasks. It focuses on two tasks - SRL and coreference resolution. The key ideas are to break down structured outputs into individual decisions, convert them into prompts to get scores from language models, and then use inference algorithms to ensure structural validity and consistency. The constraints help improve performance over unconstrained variants.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using inference after prompting to generate structurally consistent outputs. What are the advantages of using inference over just aggregating the prompted outputs? How does inference help improve performance and consistency?

2. The paper breaks down the structured prediction task into constituent sub-tasks and converts each one into a prompt-friendly format. What are somechallenges in designing good prompts for structured tasks? How can verbalizing constraints help? 

3. The framework uses scoring from language models and feeds them into inference algorithms. What are some commonly used inference algorithms and objective functions for structured prediction? How are they adapted in this framework?

4. What are the different facets of prompt engineering explored in the paper? How do factors like using zero-shot vs few-shot setting, instruction tuning, and iterative prompting impact overall performance?

5. The paper evaluates the framework on semantic role labeling and coreference resolution tasks. What are some unique challenges posed by each task? How does the framework address them through prompting and inference?

6. What are the different constraints applicable for semantic role labeling and coreference resolution tasks? How does inference help satisfy them? Can you think of other tasks where similar constraints may apply?

7. The paper analyzes impact of model size and number of shots on performance. What trends do you observe? Why does consistency not always improve with increasing model size?

8. What are some limitations of using the proposed framework? When may directly predicting structures with language models work better?

9. The framework relies on task decomposition and question generation. What recent advances can help automate these steps? How can the overall framework become more end-to-end?

10. The inference step adds overhead to the prediction pipeline. How can inference be made faster? Can model architectures be designed to inherently satisfy structural constraints?
