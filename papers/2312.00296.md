# [Towards Aligned Canonical Correlation Analysis: Preliminary Formulation   and Proof-of-Concept Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00296)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called Aligned Canonical Correlation Analysis (ACCA) to address the challenge of imperfect alignment across different views of the same entities in multi-view data. Traditional Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) assumes a one-to-one correspondence between entities across views, which does not hold in many real-world datasets. The proposed ACCA method jointly learns the latent representations shared across views as in CCA, while also recovering the alignment between entities. Specifically, ACCA relaxes constraints on the alignment matrix to make optimization tractable, with additional terms in the objective enforcing properties of a permutation matrix. An alternating optimization approach is presented that iterates between updating the CCA variables and the alignment matrix. Preliminary experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the promise of ACCA in accurately recovering alignments, outperforming random guessing baselines. The accuracy improves with a properly set bound on the entropy regularization term. While further improvements to optimization and formulation are noted as future work, this paper provides an important first step towards coupled representation learning and alignment for multi-view data.
