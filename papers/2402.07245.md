## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Medical image segmentation is essential for diagnostics and treatment planning, but requires extensive labeled data which is costly and limited. 
- CNNs are good at local features while Vision Transformers (ViTs) capture long-range dependencies, but both struggle with computational efficiency for medical images.
- Limited labeled data and computational constraints pose obstacles to precise medical image segmentation.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes Semi-Mamba-UNet, integrating a Mamba-based UNet into a semi-supervised learning framework with pixel-level contrastive cross-supervision between networks.
- Leverages complementary strengths of CNN and Mamba architectures via two separate Mamba-based UNet models.
- Introduces pixel-level contrastive learning using projector pairs to maximize feature learning from limited labeled and unlabeled data.  
- Uses pixel-level cross-supervision where networks generate pseudo-labels to train each other on unlabeled data.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring Mamba architecture for medical image segmentation with limited annotations.
- Integrates Mamba-based segmentation network with semi-supervised learning and evaluates against UNet and Swin-UNet across SSL methods.
- Proposes pixel-level contrastive and cross-supervised learning strategies to enhance feature learning.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for cardiac MRI segmentation using public dataset, especially in low labeled data regimes.

In summary, it proposes a novel semi-supervised framework with Mamba networks for medical image segmentation that uses self-supervised contrastive learning and cross-supervision between networks to maximize utilization of limited labeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.
