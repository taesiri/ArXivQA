# [TDeLTA: A Light-weight and Robust Table Detection Method based on   Learning Text Arrangement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Table detection is challenging due to the diversity of table styles. Existing image-based models achieve high performance on seen table styles but suffer significant degradation when encountering out-of-distribution tables. 
- These models tend to overfit to superficial table styles and do not truly understand tables.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose TDeLTA, a light-weight and robust table detection method based on learning text arrangement. 
- TDeLTA takes text blocks as input and models their arrangement using a BiLSTM encoder and attention module to classify them into 4 categories (row headers, column headers, content cells, outside text).
- Table boundaries are then generated from the text classifications using a post-processing algorithm. By modeling text arrangement, TDeLTA relies on the intrinsic structure of tables rather than superficial styles.

Main Contributions:
- TDeLTA achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods on PubTables dataset using only 3.1M parameters.
- When tested on the out-of-distribution FinTabNet dataset, TDeLTA outperforms prior arts by a large margin of 7% under 0-shot setting, demonstrating strong robustness.
- Analysis shows TDeLTA truly understands tables by learning text arrangement while other models overfit to styles.
- TDeLTA also shows practicality by working directly with OCR inputs instead of ground truth text annotations.

In summary, the key innovation is modeling inherent text arrangement to make table detection robust to varying styles, instead of just treating tables as visual objects. This allows superior generalization ability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes TDeLTA, a light-weight and robust table detection method that models the arrangement of text blocks to classify them into semantic categories and detect table regions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing TDeLTA, a light-weight and robust table detection method that relies on modeling text arrangement rather than raw images. This enables it to handle out-of-distribution tables across different styles.

2. Designing a text classification task to classify text blocks into 4 categories (row headers, column headers, content cells, outside text) based on their semantic roles in tables. This aids precise table localization and helps distinguish adjacent tables. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks demonstrating TDeLTA's effectiveness and strong robustness, especially under the 0-shot setting. The results prove that modeling text arrangement can help overcome interference caused by superficial table styles.

In summary, the key innovation is utilizing text arrangement instead of visual patterns to fundamentally improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen table styles in the few-shot and 0-shot settings. The text classification task and experimental results further support the advantages of this idea.
