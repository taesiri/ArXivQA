# [Enhancing Unsupervised Video Representation Learning by Decoupling the   Scene and the Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05757)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper aims to tackle is:How to alleviate the "scene-dominated bias" in video representation learning, so that the learned representations are more sensitive to motion patterns rather than just static scene context. The authors motivate this question by showing that for some action categories in current video datasets, models can recognize them just from static backgrounds without looking at the motions. This indicates the models are relying too much on scene context rather than learning distinctive motion patterns. To address this issue, the central hypothesis of the paper is:By explicitly decoupling the scene and motion information during self-supervised pre-training, through specific data augmentation strategies, the model can learn representations that are more sensitive to temporal motion patterns and less biased by static scene context.In summary, the key research question is how to reduce scene bias and enhance motion modeling in video representation learning. The central hypothesis is that by decoupling scene and motion via data augmentations during self-supervised pre-training, the model can learn representations that focus more on distinctive motions rather than just scene context.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a self-supervised method called Decoupling the Scene and the Motion (DSM) to alleviate the scene bias problem in video representation learning. 2. It designs two effective strategies, Spatial Local Disturbance and Temporal Local Disturbance, to construct positive and negative video clip pairs for each video. The positive clip breaks the spatial scene structure while keeping the motion intact, and the negative clip breaks the motion while retaining the spatial structure.3. It formulates the self-supervised video representation learning into a data-driven metric learning problem, pulling the positive samples closer while pushing the negative samples farther from the anchor video in the latent space. 4. It achieves state-of-the-art results on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets for action recognition using unsupervised pre-training, outperforming previous methods by a large margin.5. It demonstrates the learned representations are more sensitive to motion patterns and less biased by scenes through visualization and analysis.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the DSM method to decouple the scene and motion in videos in a self-supervised manner, leading to video representations that are more motion-focused and less prone to scene bias. The simple yet effective data augmentation strategies and metric learning formulation are key to the method's performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised method called Decoupling the Scene and the Motion (DSM) that improves video representation learning by constructing positive and negative video clip pairs that break the coupling between scenes and motions.
