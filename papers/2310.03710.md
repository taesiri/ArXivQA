# [Agent Instructs Large Language Models to be General Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03710)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can an autonomous agent be used to instruct large language models to improve their general zero-shot reasoning abilities across a diverse range of language understanding tasks?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) An autonomous agent can be designed to generate high-quality, task-specific instructions for a variety of language understanding tasks. 

2) Providing these agent-generated instructions as prompts will align the reasoning process of large language models more closely with each specific task, enhancing their zero-shot reasoning abilities.

3) This approach of agent-instructed reasoning will allow large language models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot settings across tasks spanning classification, generation, and reasoning.

The paper aims to test these hypotheses by:

- Developing an agent architecture that can automatically produce step-by-step instructions for completing a given language task based on basic information about the dataset.

- Using the agent's instructions, instead of a generic prompt, to guide the chain of thought reasoning process of large language models.

- Evaluating this approach of zero-shot agent-instructed reasoning on a diverse set of NLP benchmarks across classification, generation, and reasoning.

In summary, the central research question is whether an autonomous agent can instruct large language models to unlock improved general zero-shot reasoning abilities on a wide range of language understanding tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces Agent Instructs, a method to improve the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models on general language understanding tasks. The key contributions are:

1. An autonomous agent is built to instruct the reasoning process of LLMs for a task by generating task-specific instructions. This helps align the LLM's chain of thought reasoning with the particular task.

2. The combination of the agent instructions and task-specific reasoning is shown to generalize the zero-shot reasoning abilities of LLMs to more tasks, including generation, classification, and reasoning.

3. Experiments on 29 datasets show Agent Instructs substantially improves the performance of LLMs like Vicuna, Llama, and GPT-3.5 in the zero-shot setting, achieving new state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks.

4. The decoupled agent and LLM design is more cost-effective than using agents directly, with minimal performance loss. The human-understandable reasoning steps also improve alignment and safety.

5. This work provides a new approach to improve zero-shot reasoning through task instructions and establishes strong performance of LLMs on diverse language understanding benchmarks.

In summary, the key contribution is a method to produce task-specific instructions using an agent, which are then used to guide the chain of thought reasoning process of LLMs, generalizing their zero-shot reasoning abilities to more tasks and improving alignment.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Agent Instructs that improves the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models by having an autonomous agent generate task-specific instructions to guide the model's reasoning process, and shows this approach boosts performance on a wide range of NLP datasets spanning generation, classification, and reasoning tasks.
