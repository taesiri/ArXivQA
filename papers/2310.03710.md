# [Agent Instructs Large Language Models to be General Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03710)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can an autonomous agent be used to instruct large language models to improve their general zero-shot reasoning abilities across a diverse range of language understanding tasks?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) An autonomous agent can be designed to generate high-quality, task-specific instructions for a variety of language understanding tasks. 

2) Providing these agent-generated instructions as prompts will align the reasoning process of large language models more closely with each specific task, enhancing their zero-shot reasoning abilities.

3) This approach of agent-instructed reasoning will allow large language models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot settings across tasks spanning classification, generation, and reasoning.

The paper aims to test these hypotheses by:

- Developing an agent architecture that can automatically produce step-by-step instructions for completing a given language task based on basic information about the dataset.

- Using the agent's instructions, instead of a generic prompt, to guide the chain of thought reasoning process of large language models.

- Evaluating this approach of zero-shot agent-instructed reasoning on a diverse set of NLP benchmarks across classification, generation, and reasoning.

In summary, the central research question is whether an autonomous agent can instruct large language models to unlock improved general zero-shot reasoning abilities on a wide range of language understanding tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces Agent Instructs, a method to improve the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models on general language understanding tasks. The key contributions are:

1. An autonomous agent is built to instruct the reasoning process of LLMs for a task by generating task-specific instructions. This helps align the LLM's chain of thought reasoning with the particular task.

2. The combination of the agent instructions and task-specific reasoning is shown to generalize the zero-shot reasoning abilities of LLMs to more tasks, including generation, classification, and reasoning.

3. Experiments on 29 datasets show Agent Instructs substantially improves the performance of LLMs like Vicuna, Llama, and GPT-3.5 in the zero-shot setting, achieving new state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks.

4. The decoupled agent and LLM design is more cost-effective than using agents directly, with minimal performance loss. The human-understandable reasoning steps also improve alignment and safety.

5. This work provides a new approach to improve zero-shot reasoning through task instructions and establishes strong performance of LLMs on diverse language understanding benchmarks.

In summary, the key contribution is a method to produce task-specific instructions using an agent, which are then used to guide the chain of thought reasoning process of LLMs, generalizing their zero-shot reasoning abilities to more tasks and improving alignment.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more robust evaluation metrics and benchmarks to better assess the reasoning capabilities of models. The authors mention that existing benchmarks focus more on shallow pattern matching rather than complex reasoning. They suggest developing more comprehensive benchmarks that test for true reasoning skills.

- Improving the reasoning and generalization abilities of large language models through better prompt and data design. The authors propose exploring prompt engineering techniques like chain of thought prompting that could elicit better reasoning from models. They also suggest using more diverse and complex training data.

- Combining neural models with symbolic AI and knowledge representation. The authors discuss integrating neural approaches with more structured knowledge and reasoning systems to take advantage of the strengths of both paradigms. This could improve interpretability and out-of-distribution generalization.

- Exploring different model architectures and self-supervised objectives that encourage more systematic thinking. The authors propose architectures with discrete reasoning steps and self-supervised pretraining methods that teach scientific or mathematical thinking.

- Developing more interactive learning frameworks where models continuously learn through feedback. This includes settings like assisted/reinforced learning where human input directs the model's learning process over time.

- Understanding reasoning across modalities like vision and language. Extending reasoning skills beyond just text to multimodal settings.

In summary, the key directions involve improvements in evaluation, reasoning capabilities, model architectures, and training frameworks to develop models that can exhibit complex reasoning and generalizable intelligence. More human-like thinking remains an open challenge for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Agent Instructs to improve the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models on general language understanding tasks. The key idea is to build an autonomous agent that generates task-specific instructions to guide the reasoning process of the large language model for a given task. First, the agent accesses knowledge about the task from the web to produce step-by-step instructions. Then, the instructions are used to prompt the language model to perform chain of thought reasoning optimized for the specific task. The reasoning steps are guided by the instructions to output predictions. Experiments are conducted on a diverse set of 29 datasets covering generation, classification, and reasoning tasks. Results on three large language models (Vicuna-13b, Llama-2-chat, GPT-3.5 Turbo) show the Agent Instructs method substantially improves performance over standard zero-shot learning and zero-shot chain of thought across most datasets. The approach obtains state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 20 datasets. This demonstrates the efficacy of using an agent to generate task-specific instructions for unleashing the zero-shot reasoning potential of large language models.

Compared to zero-shot chain of thought, average gains are significant, especially on reasoning where the average increase is 13.9%. With the agent instructions, Llama-2-70B even outperforms GPT-3.5 without needing any examples, demonstrating the promise of agent instructed reasoning.
