## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is:

How can we develop an interactive visualization tool to help non-expert users understand how text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion work?

The key points are:

- Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can generate impressively realistic images from text prompts. However, their complex internal operations make them difficult for non-experts to comprehend. 

- Existing resources that explain diffusion models often presume knowledge of machine learning or focus on mathematical details, making them inaccessible to general audiences.

- The authors propose building an interactive web-based visualization tool called Diffusion Explainer that tightly integrates overviews of the model architecture with detailed explanations of the underlying operations.

- Diffusion Explainer aims to help users without machine learning expertise learn how text prompts are transformed into images through features like animations, comparisons of prompt variations, and interactive elements.

- By making Diffusion Explainer accessible via web browsers without needing installation or advanced hardware, the authors hope to broaden public understanding of generative AI technologies.

In summary, the central research goal is to develop an interactive visualization technique tailored to non-expert audiences that explains how text-to-image diffusion models work under the hood. The Diffusion Explainer tool is their proposed approach to addressing this question.
