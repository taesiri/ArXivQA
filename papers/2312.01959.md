# [Learning-Based Approaches to Predictive Monitoring with Conformal   Statistical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01959)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of learning-based approaches to predictive monitoring (PM) of cyber-physical systems, with a focus on providing statistical guarantees on the reliability of predictions. The goal of PM is to predict violations of temporal logic requirements from the current system state before they occur. While model checking would offer precise PM, it is computationally expensive, so the authors propose using efficient deep learning models as approximations. A key challenge is ensuring reliable predictions, so they apply conformal prediction to complement the neural predictions with uncertainty estimates that enjoy finite-sample statistical guarantees on the generalization error. Their framework covers different system dynamics (deterministic, stochastic), state observability (full or partial), and requirement semantics (Boolean or quantitative). Overall, their methods achieve efficient and statistically rigorous PM to detect imminent safety violations across varied cyber-physical system models. Key innovations include handling stochastic dynamics via conformalized quantile regression and partial observability via end-to-end or modular state estimation and classification.
