# [Towards Understanding the Relationship between In-context Learning and   Compositional Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11834)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks struggle with compositional generalization - the ability to understand and produce novel combinations of known components. This is an important aspect of human language processing.
- Standard training of neural models lacks an inductive bias towards acquiring compositional representations. Models tend to memorize training examples rather than learning to generalize compositionally. 

Proposed Solution: 
- Hypothesize that forcing models to "in-context learn" can provide a useful inductive bias for compositional generalization. 
- In-context learning refers to the model generalizing to new examples conditioned only on few demonstration examples, without updating parameters.
- Implement a meta-learning regime with causal Transformer to explicitly incentivize in-context learning from scratch. Construct meta-task distribution by sampling random orderings of training data pairs and concatenating them into trajectories. Also shuffle output labels to prevent memorization.   

Main Contributions:
- Show the meta-trained model has substantially improved compositional generalization on SCAN, COGS and GeoQuery datasets compared to baselines. 
- Demonstrate connections between in-context learning and compositional generalization through ablation studies: more in-context learning problems enable better generalization; success of in-context learning depends on informative contexts and absence of memorization.
- Show pre-trained models can also benefit from additional meta-training for in-context learning.

In summary, the paper provides evidence that in-context learning can induce better compositional generalization in neural models. The proposed meta-learning approach is a general framework applicable to various datasets without requiring extensive prior knowledge.
