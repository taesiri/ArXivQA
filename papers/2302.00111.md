# [Learning Universal Policies via Text-Guided Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00111)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses examined in this paper are:

1) Can text-conditioned video generation be an effective way to learn general-purpose policies that enable combinatorial generalization, multi-task learning, and real world transfer? 

The hypothesis is that by framing policy learning as a text-conditioned video generation problem, it will allow leveraging the combinatorial nature of language and the universal interface of videos to generalize policies to new goals/tasks.

2) Can hierarchical video generation correspond to hierarchical planning, where coarse plans can be refined into more detailed plans?

The hypothesis is that hierarchical video generation can enable more effective planning by first generating high-level plans that are then refined into more detailed action plans.

3) Can video generation be steered at test time by introducing new constraints to bias the generated plans? 

The hypothesis is that test-time sampling can be used to bias video generation towards satisfying certain constraints or reaching certain intermediate states.

4) Can pretraining video generation models on large internet video/text datasets enable transferring and generalizing policies to real robotic tasks?

The hypothesis is that internet-scale pretraining will provide a broad set of "demonstrations" that aids in synthesizing realistic video plans for novel robotic environments and tasks.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that formulating policies as text-conditioned video generation models will enable greater generalization, more effective planning, and transfer of internet-scale knowledge, compared to traditional policy learning approaches. The experiments aim to test if these hypothesized benefits hold true.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing a new approach of using text-conditional video generation as a general framework for learning universal policies for sequential decision making across diverse environments and tasks. Some key aspects of their approach and contributions:

- They formulate a new abstraction called the Unified Predictive Decision Process (UPDP) as an alternative to MDPs for unified policy learning. The UPDP uses images/video as a universal interface and leverages text for task specifications, avoiding the need for reward design. It also separates planning from action execution.

- They propose a model called UniPi that instantiates the UPDP using video diffusion models for trajectory planning conditioned on text instructions and an initial frame. Actions are then inferred from the generated video plans.

- They demonstrate that their approach enables combinatorial generalization across novel combinations of subgoals specified in text, as well as effective multi-task learning and generalization across diverse environments.

- They show their method can leverage large internet video datasets for pretraining, enabling synthesis of complex behavior and transfer to real robotic tasks. 

- Overall, they propose text-conditional video generation as a new paradigm for policy learning that avoids many limitations of MDPs and prior multi-task RL methods. Using images/video as universal spaces allows leveraging vision/language models and internet data toward learning general policies.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing this video-as-policy formulation and the UniPi model as a new way to tackle challenges in learning universal policies across diverse tasks and environments by exploiting recent advances in conditional video generation. The experiments support the benefits of their approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method for learning universal policies by formulating policy generation as a text-conditioned video generation problem, where a video diffusion model synthesizes future video frames depicting planned behaviors given a textual goal description, and actions are extracted from the generated video using an inverse dynamics model; this approach enables combinatorial generalization across goals, transfer learning across tasks, hierarchical and adaptable planning, and leveraging internet-scale data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for training control policies by formulating policy learning as a text-conditioned video generation problem. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- It leverages recent advances in large language and vision models for control, whereas most prior work trains policies from scratch. This enables combinatorial generalization and knowledge transfer.

- It represents policies via generated future video frames rather than directly outputting actions. This provides a natural interface for planning, hierarchy, and human interpretability. 

- It uses text as the task specification instead of hand-designed reward functions. This avoids the challenge of reward design and enables language-directed generalization.

- It proposes the UPDP abstraction as an alternative to MDPs. UPDPs use images/video as the interface and isolate planning from action spaces to enable multi-environment learning.

- It shows the value of pretraining on web-scale video data for transferring real world knowledge. Most prior video RL work uses only task-specific data.

- It focuses on synthesizing long-term behaviors whereas most video prediction work in RL predicts only 1-step futures for model-based control.

Overall, the key novelty is using large pretrained vision/language models and internet videos for multi-task control via conditional video generation. This contrasts with common approaches that learn policies with RL optimization using custom state/action spaces. The results demonstrate improved generalization and planning abilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few interesting future research directions:

1. Scaling up the proposed approach to longer time horizons and more complex environments. The current method is demonstrated on relatively short time horizons (up to 20 time steps). Scaling the approach to much longer horizons and applying it to more complex environments like full robotic manipulation tasks would be an important next step.

2. Incorporating closed-loop feedback. Currently, the policy executes the generated plan in an open-loop manner without any corrective feedback. Adding mechanisms to adjust the plan based on actual observations could improve robustness. 

3. Combining planning and policy learning. The paper generates plans that are then executed by a separately trained policy. An exciting direction is end-to-end training where the planner and policy are jointly optimized.

4. Better utilizing pretraining. The approach shows promise in leveraging pretraining on internet videos for real world robotic tasks. Further investigation on how to best utilize this pretraining for control policies could enable scaling to more complex real world behaviors.

5. Developing improved evaluation metrics. The paper discusses the need for better metrics to evaluate the quality of generated plans for control tasks. Developing metrics beyond current ones like FID that are more suited to evaluating controllable behavior generation is an open challenge.

6. Applications to sim2real transfer. The idea of representing policies in a space like images rather than specific state and action spaces could aid sim2real transfer. Evaluating the approach for this application is promising future work.

In summary, scaling up the approach, incorporating feedback, better utilizing pretraining, developing improved generations metrics, and applications to sim2real are called out as interesting future directions to build on this work. The overall concept of representing policies as generative models conditioned on language shows promise in improving generalization and transfer capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for learning universal policies via text-guided video generation. The key idea is to formulate policy learning as a text-conditioned video generation problem, where given a text description of a desired goal, the model generates a video depicting the sequence of actions needed to accomplish that goal. The video is then used to infer the underlying actions to execute in the real environment through an inverse dynamics model. This approach allows the model to leverage the combinatorial power of language and the universal nature of video to generalize to novel goals and tasks across diverse environments. The model is trained on a large dataset of internet videos and shows several benefits: 1) it can combinatorially generalize to unseen compositions of subgoals, 2) it enables multi-task learning across varied environments, 3) it supports hierarchical planning through coarse-to-fine video generation, and 4) it allows transferring real world knowledge through pretraining on web videos. Experiments validate these advantages, showing improved generalization over baselines in combinatorial planning, multi-task transfer, and real robot settings. Overall, this work illustrates the potential of using generative video models and web-scale data to learn universal policies.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the Unified Predictive Decision Process (UPDP) as an alternative to standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for formulating sequential decision making problems. The key components of a UPDP are (1) a video generator model that can synthesize future state trajectories conditioned on an initial state and task description, and (2) a policy that maps generated state trajectories to actions. 

UPDPs use images/videos as a universal interface for representing states across environments and natural language for specifying tasks. This allows for combinatorial generalization across tasks and transfer learning across environments with different state/action spaces. The paper shows how diffusion models can be used to instantiate the video generator component of a UPDP. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed UniPi, enables effective combinatorial generalization, multi-task learning, and transfer from internet videos to real robot tasks. Key benefits include the ability to leverage hierarchical planning in the video space and adapt plans via sampling. Overall, formulating policies as conditional video generators is shown to be a promising approach for learning universal policies that generalize across diverse tasks and environments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called UniPi for training text-conditioned policies that can exhibit combinatorial generalization, effectively learn across multiple environments, and leverage real-world videos for knowledge transfer. The key idea is to formulate policy learning as a text-conditioned video generation problem. Specifically, given a text description of a goal, the method uses a video diffusion model to generate a sequence of future frames depicting the planned actions to accomplish the goal. An inverse dynamics model is then used to extract the underlying actions from the generated video plan. By leveraging language as the interface for specifying goals and video as the interface for planning, this approach allows for combinatorial generalization to novel goals, multi-task learning across diverse environments, and pretraining on real-world internet videos. The video diffusion model is trained to generate constrained videos starting from an initial frame and task text. Environment consistency is enforced by tiling the initial frame across time steps. Hierarchical planning is enabled by first generating sparse frame sequences that are refined into detailed plans. The inverse dynamics model is trained separately on a small dataset to infer actions from video frames.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper presents a method for learning universal policies via text-guided video generation. The key problems and questions it seeks to address are:

1. How to enable combinatorial generalization of policies across a variety of tasks and goals specified in natural language. The paper proposes using text as a general interface for specifying goals/tasks and video generation as a way to plan policies that achieve those goals.

2. How to enable effective multi-task learning and transfer across environments with different state/action spaces. The paper proposes using video as a universal representation to embed different environments into a shared space.

3. How to leverage large amounts of unlabeled video data from the internet to aid in policy learning. The paper shows how pretraining the video generation model on web-scale video datasets enables transferring knowledge to downstream tasks.

4. Whether video generation can be an effective alternative to traditional policy learning that predicts actions directly from states. The paper aims to demonstrate the advantages of planning via video generation in terms of interpretability, hierarchical planning, and generalization compared to standard policy learning methods.

In summary, the key focus is using video generation, conditioned on language specifications of goals/tasks, as a way to train universal policies that can generalize effectively across a diverse set of environments and tasks. The paper aims to show the advantages of this approach over methods that learn policies directly in environment-specific state/action spaces.
