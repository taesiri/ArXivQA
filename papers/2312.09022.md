# [Brain Diffuser with Hierarchical Transformer for MCI Causality Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09022)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called the brain diffuser with hierarchical transformer (BDHT) for estimating effective connectivity from fMRI data to analyze mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The BDHT leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model, using rough fMRI data and structural connectivity from DTI as conditions to guide the model to remove noise and generate clean ROI time series and effective connectivity networks. The model employs a hierarchical transformer architecture to capture multi-scale spatiotemporal features and topological relationships during the denoising process for improved performance. Evaluations on ADNI dataset demonstrate superior accuracy in reconstructing time series over VAE and GAN models. The estimated effective connectivities also achieve the best classification results for MCI diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis identifies important regions like the parahippocampal gyrus and connections related to memory and language as being impacted in MCI. Overall, the BDHT provides an end-to-end approach to obtain discriminative connectivity biomarkers from raw fMRI to reveal mechanisms underlying MCI for early detection and tracking of disease progression.
