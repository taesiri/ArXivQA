# [RESIN-EDITOR: A Schema-guided Hierarchical Event Graph Visualizer and   Editor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03093)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Complex events like disease outbreaks or terrorist attacks unfold over weeks/months and involve many interrelated sub-events. Modeling these events is challenging as it requires capturing temporal, logical and hierarchical connections between sub-events.  
- Existing information extraction (IE) systems and visualizers are limited in their ability to model and visualize such complex multi-document, multi-media events. They lack capabilities for hierarchical graph visualization, source tracing, and user editing.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present RESIN-Editor, an interactive visualizer and editor for complex event graphs extracted from multimedia news clusters. 
- The system visualizes a hierarchical event graph which is obtained by matching extracted events to a human-curated schema graph. It shows events as nodes, temporal relations as horizontal links, and hierarchical relations as vertical links.
- Key capabilities:
  - Hierarchical graph visualization showing events at multiple granularities.
  - Detailed provenance tracing that links events/entities back to source text/images.
  - Interactive editing that allows users to modify the graph structure and node attributes.

Main Contributions:
- A novel editor for effectively analyzing complex events through multi-granularity visualization, comprehensive source tracing, and interactive editing.
- Empirical case studies on disease/terrorism events show the system is significantly more effective than analyzing events directly from documents.
- The system enables better event trigger/argument extraction, schema matching, and prediction. It provides informed schema feedback based on extracted events.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative visual analytics system called RESIN-Editor that can help both experts and developers better analyze complex multi-document events by leveraging a human-curated schema graph. Its interactive editing further enables capturing user feedback to improve information extraction systems.
