# [Compact NSGA-II for Multi-objective Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Feature selection is critical for reducing dimensionality and improving performance in machine learning, especially for large-scale datasets. It is inherently a multi-objective problem balancing classification accuracy and minimizing the number of features. For big data, feature selection becomes expensive as evaluation requires classifying a feature subset. Hence algorithms that work well with limited budget are valuable.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Compact NSGA-II (CNSGA-II), a novel memory-efficient multi-objective feature selection algorithm. Unlike typical evolutionary algorithms that maintain a population, CNSGA-II represents the population as a probability distribution using Probability Vectors (PVs). The PVs sample new feature subsets each iteration. Only non-dominated solutions and leaders guide PV updates. This allows searching wide areas of the feature space without high memory overhead.

Contributions:
1) First compact multi-objective algorithm designed for feature selection that outperforms standard NSGA-II.
2) Maintains diversity and provides superior Hypervolume over NSGA-II despite using less memory. 
3) Achieves lower classification error and removes more irrelevant features across 5 large-scale benchmark datasets.
4) Step size parameter allows balancing fast initial search versus deep optima when budget varies.
5) Demonstrates CGA is viable for expensive optimization problems given the linear complexity.

Overall, the paper presents a novel way to formulate feature selection as a compact multi-objective problem enabling scalability and efficency. The proposed CNSGA-II algorithm advances state-of-the-art in compact evolutionary computation.
