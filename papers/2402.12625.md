# [Compact NSGA-II for Multi-objective Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Feature selection is critical for reducing dimensionality and improving performance in machine learning, especially for large-scale datasets. It is inherently a multi-objective problem balancing classification accuracy and minimizing the number of features. For big data, feature selection becomes expensive as evaluation requires classifying a feature subset. Hence algorithms that work well with limited budget are valuable.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Compact NSGA-II (CNSGA-II), a novel memory-efficient multi-objective feature selection algorithm. Unlike typical evolutionary algorithms that maintain a population, CNSGA-II represents the population as a probability distribution using Probability Vectors (PVs). The PVs sample new feature subsets each iteration. Only non-dominated solutions and leaders guide PV updates. This allows searching wide areas of the feature space without high memory overhead.

Contributions:
1) First compact multi-objective algorithm designed for feature selection that outperforms standard NSGA-II.
2) Maintains diversity and provides superior Hypervolume over NSGA-II despite using less memory. 
3) Achieves lower classification error and removes more irrelevant features across 5 large-scale benchmark datasets.
4) Step size parameter allows balancing fast initial search versus deep optima when budget varies.
5) Demonstrates CGA is viable for expensive optimization problems given the linear complexity.

Overall, the paper presents a novel way to formulate feature selection as a compact multi-objective problem enabling scalability and efficency. The proposed CNSGA-II algorithm advances state-of-the-art in compact evolutionary computation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a compact version of the NSGA-II multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called CNSGA-II and applies it to multi-objective feature selection, outperforming NSGA-II in terms of convergence and diversity while using less memory.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel compact multi-objective optimization algorithm called Compact NSGA-II (CNSGA-II) and applying it to the problem of multi-objective feature selection. Specifically:

- CNSGA-II is the first compact multi-objective algorithm designed for feature selection. It uses a probabilistic representation (probability vectors) to encode the population instead of explicitly storing candidate solutions. This makes it very memory efficient compared to regular multi-objective algorithms like NSGA-II.

- New solutions are generated by sampling from the probability vectors instead of using genetic operators. The probability vectors get updated based on the best solutions at each iteration to focus the search.

- CNSGA-II is shown to outperform NSGA-II on several high-dimensional feature selection problems in terms of convergence and distribution of solutions on the Pareto front, while using significantly less memory.

- The method has hyperparameters like step size and number of probability vectors that allow trading off convergence speed vs final solution quality.

In summary, the key novelty is proposing a compact multi-objective optimization algorithm that is tailored for expensive feature selection problems and demonstrating its effectiveness compared to a state-of-the-art method like NSGA-II.

The paper proposes a new compact multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called Compact NSGA-II (CNSGA-II) for feature selection. The key ideas include representing the population as probability vectors instead of a set of solutions to save memory, using non-dominated sorting and hypervolume to evaluate performance, and sampling new solutions from the probability vectors each iteration. It is tested on several large-scale datasets for simultaneously minimizing classification error and number of features selected. The proposed compact algorithm outperforms the standard NSGA-II in terms of hypervolume and objectives, using less memory.
