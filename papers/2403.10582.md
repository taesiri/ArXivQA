# [How Suboptimal is Training rPPG Models with Videos and Targets from   Different Body Sites?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) uses video of a person's face to estimate their blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform. This enables non-contact measurement of heart rate and other cardiovascular signals.
- Most rPPG methods are trained in a supervised manner, using contact PPG sensors on the fingers as target signals to train neural networks. However, PPG signals can vary substantially in morphology and timing across different body locations.
- It is unknown whether using finger PPG signals to train facial video rPPG models is optimal, since there may be a domain gap between face videos and finger PPG targets.

Methods:
- The authors utilized a unique multimodal dataset containing simultaneous face video, forehead PPG, and finger PPG measurements from 18 participants. 
- Three state-of-the-art neural rPPG methods (DeepPhys, TS-CAN, PhysNet) were trained on face videos using either the forehead or finger PPG signals as supervision targets.
- Quantitative waveform similarity (mean squared error) and qualitative waveform inspection were used to compare forehead versus finger PPG training.

Results:
- Training with forehead PPG led to much better performance than finger PPG when testing on forehead PPG, with up to 40% lower MSE. The models learned the correct morphology more effectively.
- Finger PPG training struggled to predict proper waveform morphology and timing when testing on forehead PPG. There appears to be a substantial domain gap.
- However, finger PPG training could still predict the main heart rate reasonably accurately during testing.

Contributions:  
- This is the first study demonstrating that using forehead PPG targets leads to better facial video rPPG performance compared to standard finger PPG target training.
- Both quantitatively and qualitatively, forehead PPG supervision enables more accurate waveform morphology and timing predictions.
- The results indicate that minimizing domain gaps between training supervision signals and input/output spaces is very important for rPPG neural networks.
