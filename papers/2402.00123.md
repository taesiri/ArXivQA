# [Comparing Template-based and Template-free Language Model Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00123)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Two main methods for probing language models for knowledge: template-based (uses expert-created templates like "[X] was born in [MASK]") and template-free (uses naturally occurring text). 
- Differences between these approaches have been overlooked, but could significantly impact assessment of how much knowledge is captured by LMs.

Methodology:
- Evaluate 16 language models on 10 probing datasets (4 template-based, 6 template-free) in general domain and biomedicine.
- Propose method to create template-free biomedical probing dataset (LIPID).
- Compare model rankings, scores, perplexity between approaches.

Key Findings:
- Template-free and template-based approaches often rank models differently, except for top domain-specific models.  
- Scores decrease substantially (up to 42% in accuracy) when comparing template-free vs template-based on parallel datasets.
- Perplexity negatively correlated with accuracy for template-free but positively correlated for template-based.
- Models tend to predict same answers frequently across prompts for template-based but not for template-free.

Main Contributions:
- First study comparing template-based and template-free probing approaches. Reveals significant differences in assessment of language model knowledge.
- Method to create template-free domain-specific (biomedical) probing datasets. 
- Introduction of LIPID, the first biomedical template-free probing benchmark.
- Analysis highlighting factors like overuse of templates, overconfident models, data distribution issues that contribute to differences between approaches.

Conclusion:
- Important to use both probing approaches to comprehensively evaluate factual knowledge in language models. Template-free gives higher lower bound of knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares template-based and template-free language model probing across multiple models and datasets, finding substantial differences in model rankings and scores between the two approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors evaluate 16 language models on 10 probing datasets (4 template-based and 6 template-free) in multiple domains to compare template-based and template-free probing approaches. 

2) They propose a method to create template-free domain-specific datasets and use it to develop the first template-free biomedical probing dataset (LIPID). This allows comparing the two probing approaches in different domains.

3) They find that model rankings and scores differ substantially between template-based and template-free probing. Models also exhibit different behaviors like lower perplexity but worse accuracy on template-based data.

4) Their analyses suggest that the two techniques may evaluate different kinds of knowledge in language models. The template-free approach provides a higher lower bound estimate of model knowledge.

5) They emphasize the need to use multiple probing techniques to comprehensively evaluate the factual knowledge stored in language models. Their findings open avenues for future work on better evaluation strategies.

The main focus of the paper is on comparing two approaches for evaluating the factual knowledge stored in language models - template-based probing using expert-created cloze statement templates, and template-free probing using naturally occurring text. The key differences, results, and analyses compare model rankings, scores, accuracy, perplexity, etc. between these two techniques, applied to both general domain and biomedical models and datasets. The paper also introduces a new biomedical dataset called LIPID to enable analysis in the biomedical domain.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method for creating template-free domain-specific probing datasets. Can you walk through the four main steps of this process in detail? What considerations went into the design of each step? 

2. The paper finds that model rankings differ significantly between template-based and template-free probing approaches, except for top domain-specific models. Why might top domain-specific models show more consistency in rankings across probing approaches compared to generic English models?

3. What potential reasons does the paper discuss for the substantial score differences observed between template-free and template-based probing on parallel datasets like Google-RE and T-REx? Which of these reasons do you think provides the most convincing explanation?

4. The paper finds perplexity is negatively correlated with accuracy for template-free probing but positively correlated for template-based probing. Why might perplexity and accuracy show opposite relationships across probing approaches? What might this suggest about the different knowledge being tested?

5. Do you think the tendency for models to predict the same answers across prompts more often in template-based probing reflects an over-reliance on simple heuristics? How could this issue be addressed in future work?

6. The authors conclude template-free probing provides a higher lower bound estimate on model knowledge. Do you agree? Should other factors beyond estimating knowledge also play a role in choosing a probing approach?

7. Could the better perplexity of smaller models on some template-based datasets reflect those models learning simpler heuristics that happen to work well for those particular templates and datasets? How would you test this hypothesis?  

8. While analyzing datasets with different numbers of entities, the results show score drops are larger for SQuAD than CTD/Wikidata despite SQuAD having fewer additional entities. What factors might explain this discrepancy in impact?

9. Do you think our current understanding of what knowledge probing techniques actually evaluate is mature enough to conclusively determine one approach is better? Might the ideal solution involve using both in conjunction?

10. The authors recognize extremely large models as an area needing more analysis regarding these probing approaches. What challenges do you anticipate in scaling up these methods to models with billions of parameters?
