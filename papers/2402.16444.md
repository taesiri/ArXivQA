# [ShieldLM: Empowering LLMs as Aligned, Customizable and Explainable   Safety Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is an urgent need for automated tools to detect safety risks in the responses generated by large language models (LLMs), due to high costs and inefficiencies of solely relying on human oversight.
- Existing methods lack balance between alignment with human safety standards and customizability to new policies or standards. They also lack explainability.

Proposed Solution - ShieldLM:
- Proposes ShieldLM, an LLM-based safety detector that is aligned, customizable, and explainable.

Key Contributions:
- Compiles a large bilingual dataset with 14,387 query-response pairs annotated for safety based on various standards. Identifies 7 types of controversial cases requiring distinct rules.

- Enhances customizability by training ShieldLM to handle multiple rules, where only a subset may be relevant for each case. Incorporates irrelevant rules during training to teach model to recognize applicable rules.

- Builds a pipeline to automatically generate explanations from GPT-4 that are consistent with human labels and rules. Makes ShieldLM explain its predictions.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of ShieldLM across in-distribution and 3 out-of-distribution test sets. Quantitatively validates its customizability and explainability.

- Highlights ShieldLM's practical utility through its deployment as a reliable safety evaluator for advanced LLMs in a real-world application.

- Releases ShieldLM to assist developers in safety detection under diverse standards, contributing to broader efforts focused on enhancing LLM safety.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ShieldLM, an LLM-based safety detector that is trained on a large annotated dataset to align with human safety standards, supports customizable detection rules, and provides natural language explanations for its decisions, in order to accurately and transparently detect safety issues in LLM responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing ShieldLM, an aligned, customizable, and explainable safety detector for detecting safety issues in large language model (LLM) responses. ShieldLM is trained on a new bilingual dataset of over 14,000 annotated query-response pairs covering various safety issues and standards.

2. Demonstrating ShieldLM's state-of-the-art performance across multiple in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets compared to strong baselines including content moderation APIs and prompted large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

3. Quantitatively validating ShieldLM's customizability by showing its ability to adapt to distinct safety detection rules and standards. The explainability is also verified through manual evaluation.

4. Investigating the effects of various factors like explanation quality, training noise, and base model choice on ShieldLM's capabilities.

5. Showcasing ShieldLM's practical utility in a real-world application for evaluating the safety of chatbot responses on the fly.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an LLM-based safety detector called ShieldLM, which pushes the boundaries of safety detection by combining alignment with human standards, customizability to diverse rules, and explainability.
