# [More Photos are All You Need: Semi-Supervised Learning for Fine-Grained   Sketch Based Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13990)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we design an FG-SBIR model that does not require large amounts of training data?

The key hypothesis seems to be:

Leveraging unlabelled photo data through semi-supervised learning will help mitigate the performance gap imposed by limited labelled photo-sketch paired data.

Specifically, the paper proposes a semi-supervised framework that makes use of unlabelled photos and limited photo-sketch pairs to train the FG-SBIR model. The core ideas are:

1) Using a photo-to-sketch generation model to create pseudo sketch-photo pairs from unlabelled photos. 

2) Joint training of the generation and retrieval models for positive exchange of information.

3) Novel components like instance weighting, consistency loss, and policy gradient reinforcement learning to enable effective joint training.

So in summary, the central research question is how to design an FG-SBIR model that does not rely on large-scale labelled data, which is addressed through the hypothesis of using semi-supervised learning with unlabelled photos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be a novel semi-supervised framework for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) that can leverage large-scale unlabeled photos to address the data scarcity problem faced by existing FG-SBIR models. 

Specifically, the key contributions seem to be:

1) Proposing, for the first time, a semi-supervised approach to FG-SBIR that uses unlabeled photos together with limited labeled sketch-photo pairs to improve retrieval accuracy. 

2) Coupling sequential sketch generation with fine-grained SBIR in a joint learning framework based on reinforcement learning to enable mutual benefits.

3) Introducing a new photo-to-sketch generator with 2D attention and designing a discriminator-guided instance weighting scheme along with consistency loss for training retrieval with noisy synthetic pairs.

4) Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed semi-supervised framework can reach state-of-the-art performances using the same amount of training data, and achieves comparable results to fully supervised models with only a fraction of labeled data.

In summary, the main novelty lies in formulating a semi-supervised learning approach for FG-SBIR to overcome the data scarcity problem by leveraging unlabeled photos through joint training of a sketch generator and retrieval model.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work:

- The paper proposes a novel semi-supervised framework for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) that makes use of unlabeled photos to mitigate the data scarcity problem. This differs from most prior work in FG-SBIR which relies on fully supervised learning with limited labeled sketch-photo pairs. The semi-supervised approach is unique and aims to overcome the bottleneck of data scarcity.

- At the core of the framework is a sequential photo-to-sketch generation model that creates pseudo sketch-photo pairs from unlabeled photos to augment training data. This differs from previous sketch generation methods by preserving spatial resolution and using a cross-modal 2D attention mechanism.

- The paper introduces a discriminator-guided instance weighting scheme and consistency loss via knowledge distillation to provide robustness against noise in the synthesized training data. These mechanisms for handling noisy pseudo-labeled data are novel in the context of FG-SBIR.

- Joint training of the generation and retrieval models enables positive exchange of information between the two. Using policy gradients and reward signals for this joint training is a novel approach not explored in prior FG-SBIR methods.

- Compared to prior works that aim to exploit unlabeled photos like using edge maps or pretext tasks, the proposed photo-to-sketch generation better captures the abstraction and subjectivity of human drawing.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate clear improvements in both retrieval accuracy and sketch generation quality over state-of-the-art supervised baselines as well as methods that leverage unlabeled photos. The semi-supervised approach also shows substantial gains in low-data regimes.

In summary, the key novelty lies in the semi-supervised formulation for FG-SBIR and the components introduced for robust joint training of the generator and retrieval models. The paper makes several contributions to advance the state-of-the-art in fine-grained sketch-based retrieval.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Evaluating the proposed photo-to-sketch generation model on other datasets like Sketchy to further analyze its generalization ability. The authors mention that Sketchy may be more challenging due to noisier backgrounds.

- Exploring different network architectures and objective functions for the photo-to-sketch generation module. The authors propose a sequential generative model with 2D attention, but other architectures could be investigated. 

- Applying the proposed semi-supervised learning framework to other fine-grained cross-modal retrieval tasks beyond sketch-based image retrieval. The overall methodology could potentially be generalized.

- Developing techniques to further improve the robustness to noisy or poorly generated sketch-photo pairs in the semi-supervised pipeline. While the authors propose some solutions, there is room for improvement.

- Reducing the performance gap between semi-supervised and fully supervised models by developing better regularization techniques or leveraging unlabelled data. The semi-supervised model lags behind the supervised upper bound.

- Evaluating how the amount of labelled vs unlabelled data affects model performance. The authors provide an initial analysis but more detailed studies could be done.

- Exploring alternative methods for propagating signals between the generation and retrieval modules that avoid relying on the non-differentiable rasterization operation.

Overall, the main future directions focus on improving, generalizing, and extending the core technical approach, conducting more detailed empirical studies, and researching alternative designs. But the paper provides a solid base for future semi-supervised FG-SBIR research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) that aims to overcome the problem of limited training data. The key idea is to leverage a large amount of unlabeled photo data to improve retrieval performance. The framework consists of two jointly trained models - a fine-grained SBIR model and a photo-to-sketch generation model. The photo-to-sketch model generates pseudo sketch-photo pairs from unlabeled photos that augment the training data for the SBIR model. To handle noisy/unreliable pseudo pairs, two mechanisms are introduced - a discriminator that scores reliability of pairs for instance weighting of loss, and a distillation loss for consistency regularization. The SBIR model provides reward signals to train the sketch generator via policy gradient reinforcement learning. Experiments show significant gains over supervised baselines by exploiting unlabeled photos, especially in the low-data regime. The joint training framework enables positive mutual improvement of the retrieval and generative models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) to address the problem of limited training data. FG-SBIR aims to retrieve photos based on sketch queries at an intra-category level. Existing models rely on fully supervised learning, which requires large labeled sketch-photo pairs. However, scaling up sketch data is costly as each sketch must be hand-drawn. 

To overcome this data scarcity, the authors introduce a framework that leverages abundant unlabeled photos in addition to limited labeled data. The key idea is a joint learning approach between a photo-to-sketch generator and a FG-SBIR model. The generator creates pseudo sketch-photo pairs from unlabeled photos to augment training data. To avoid noisy generations, a discriminator provides reliability scores for instance weighting. The retrieval model gives feedback as rewards to improve generation quality. Experiments show significant gains over supervised baselines when using 60% less data, and state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks by exploiting unlabeled photos through this semi-supervised approach.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-supervised framework for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) that leverages unlabelled photos to account for the data scarcity problem in existing supervised approaches. The key component is a sequential photo-to-sketch generation model that takes an unlabelled photo and generates a corresponding sketch. This allows synthetic sketch-photo pairs to be created from unlabelled photos and used alongside real labelled pairs to train the FG-SBIR model. To avoid overfitting to noisy synthetic pairs, the framework includes a discriminator that scores the reliability of each synthetic pair for instance weighting of the loss, and a consistency loss via distillation to provide tolerance. The generation and retrieval models are trained jointly so they can benefit each other - the retrieval model provides reward signals back to the generator to improve sketch faithfulness, while better sketches from the generator help train the retrieval model. Experiments show significant gains over supervised baselines when using both labelled and unlabelled data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the key problem this paper is trying to address is the lack of sufficient training data (i.e. sketch-photo pairs) for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) models. 

The paper points out that current FG-SBIR datasets are limited to thousands of sketch-photo pairs, while photo datasets can scale to millions of images. Obtaining more sketch-photo pairs is costly since it requires manually drawing sketches corresponding to photos. This data scarcity limits the performance of existing FG-SBIR models which rely on fully supervised learning with many sketch-photo pairs.

To address this, the paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework that can utilize a large amount of unlabelled photos, without corresponding sketches, to improve FG-SBIR model performance with limited labelled sketch-photo pairs. The core idea is to generate pseudo sketch-photo pairs from unlabelled photos using a photo-to-sketch generation model, and use them along with real labelled pairs to train the FG-SBIR model.

In summary, the key problem is the lack of sufficient labelled sketch-photo training data for FG-SBIR models, and the paper aims to mitigate this issue by exploiting unlabelled photos in a semi-supervised learning framework.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (FG-SBIR): The paper focuses on retrieving a specific photo based on a query sketch at an intra-category level, rather than category-level retrieval.

- Data scarcity: Current FG-SBIR datasets are limited to thousands of sketch-photo pairs, compared to millions for photo-only datasets. This data scarcity bottlenecks model performance. 

- Semi-supervised learning: The paper proposes a semi-supervised framework to leverage unlabelled photos to account for the data scarcity problem.

- Instance weighting: A discriminator is used to quantify reliability of generated pseudo pairs for instance-wise weighting of the retrieval loss.

- Consistency loss: A distillation loss provides tolerance against noisy pseudo pairs during training.

- Policy gradient reinforcement learning: Used to provide training signal from retrieval to sketch generation model despite non-differentiable rasterization.

So in summary, the key terms are fine-grained SBIR, data scarcity, semi-supervised learning, photo-to-sketch generation, joint learning, instance weighting, consistency loss, and policy gradient reinforcement learning.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-supervised framework for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) to mitigate the data scarcity problem. Existing FG-SBIR models rely on large datasets of sketch-photo pairs, which are difficult to obtain at scale. The key idea is to leverage additional unlabeled photos through a sequential photo-to-sketch generation model to produce synthetic sketch-photo pairs for training the retrieval model. The framework consists of a photo-to-sketch generator with a cross-modal 2D attention mechanism and a fine-grained retrieval model. To handle noisy synthetic pairs, the retrieval model employs a discriminator for instance-wise weighting of the triplet loss and a distillation loss for regularization. The two modules are trained jointly - the retrieval model provides a reward signal to improve sketch generation through policy gradient, while better sketches in turn improve retrieval. Extensive experiments on shoe and chair datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both sketch generation quality and retrieval accuracy compared to supervised baselines. The framework provides an effective way to overcome data scarcity and achieve state-of-the-art FG-SBIR performance even with limited training data.

This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised framework for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) to address the problem of limited training data. The key idea is to leverage a large number of unlabeled real photos to improve model performance. The framework consists of two jointly trained components: 1) a sequential photo-to-sketch generator that converts unlabeled photos to sketch-photo pairs, and 2) a FG-SBIR model that retrieves photos based on sketch queries.
