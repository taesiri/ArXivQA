# [More Photos are All You Need: Semi-Supervised Learning for Fine-Grained   Sketch Based Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13990)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we design an FG-SBIR model that does not require large amounts of training data?The key hypothesis seems to be:Leveraging unlabelled photo data through semi-supervised learning will help mitigate the performance gap imposed by limited labelled photo-sketch paired data.Specifically, the paper proposes a semi-supervised framework that makes use of unlabelled photos and limited photo-sketch pairs to train the FG-SBIR model. The core ideas are:1) Using a photo-to-sketch generation model to create pseudo sketch-photo pairs from unlabelled photos. 2) Joint training of the generation and retrieval models for positive exchange of information.3) Novel components like instance weighting, consistency loss, and policy gradient reinforcement learning to enable effective joint training.So in summary, the central research question is how to design an FG-SBIR model that does not rely on large-scale labelled data, which is addressed through the hypothesis of using semi-supervised learning with unlabelled photos.
