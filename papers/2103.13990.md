# [More Photos are All You Need: Semi-Supervised Learning for Fine-Grained   Sketch Based Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13990)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we design an FG-SBIR model that does not require large amounts of training data?The key hypothesis seems to be:Leveraging unlabelled photo data through semi-supervised learning will help mitigate the performance gap imposed by limited labelled photo-sketch paired data.Specifically, the paper proposes a semi-supervised framework that makes use of unlabelled photos and limited photo-sketch pairs to train the FG-SBIR model. The core ideas are:1) Using a photo-to-sketch generation model to create pseudo sketch-photo pairs from unlabelled photos. 2) Joint training of the generation and retrieval models for positive exchange of information.3) Novel components like instance weighting, consistency loss, and policy gradient reinforcement learning to enable effective joint training.So in summary, the central research question is how to design an FG-SBIR model that does not rely on large-scale labelled data, which is addressed through the hypothesis of using semi-supervised learning with unlabelled photos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be a novel semi-supervised framework for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) that can leverage large-scale unlabeled photos to address the data scarcity problem faced by existing FG-SBIR models. Specifically, the key contributions seem to be:1) Proposing, for the first time, a semi-supervised approach to FG-SBIR that uses unlabeled photos together with limited labeled sketch-photo pairs to improve retrieval accuracy. 2) Coupling sequential sketch generation with fine-grained SBIR in a joint learning framework based on reinforcement learning to enable mutual benefits.3) Introducing a new photo-to-sketch generator with 2D attention and designing a discriminator-guided instance weighting scheme along with consistency loss for training retrieval with noisy synthetic pairs.4) Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed semi-supervised framework can reach state-of-the-art performances using the same amount of training data, and achieves comparable results to fully supervised models with only a fraction of labeled data.In summary, the main novelty lies in formulating a semi-supervised learning approach for FG-SBIR to overcome the data scarcity problem by leveraging unlabeled photos through joint training of a sketch generator and retrieval model.
