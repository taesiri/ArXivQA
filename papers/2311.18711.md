# [Women Are Beautiful, Men Are Leaders: Gender Stereotypes in Machine   Translation and Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18711)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces GEST, a new dataset for measuring gender stereotypical reasoning in masked language models and machine translation systems across English and 9 Slavic languages. GEST contains over 3,500 samples capturing 16 specific gender stereotypes (e.g. "women are beautiful", "men are leaders") that were defined based on sociological research and input from gender experts. The authors evaluate GEST on 11 masked language models (including mBERT, XLM-R) and 4 machine translation systems (including Google Translate), finding significant and consistent stereotypical reasoning across almost all models and languages tested. For instance, samples about beauty and diligence are most strongly associated with women while leadership and professionalism are most masculine. The results are shown to be robust across different system types, models, languages and prompts. The paper discusses the extensibility of the methodology to other languages and stereotypes and highlights limitations around semantic bias effects and gender binarism assumptions. Overall, the paper demonstrates the prevalence of learned gender stereotypes in NLP systems and provides an intuitive, standardized methodology for continued monitoring and mitigation of this issue.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces GEST, a new dataset for measuring gender stereotypical reasoning in masked language models and machine translation systems across English and 9 Slavic languages, and uses GEST to evaluate several models, finding significant and consistent amounts of stereotypical reasoning in almost all models and languages tested.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation of the GEST dataset for measuring gender-stereotypical reasoning in masked language models and machine translation systems. Specifically:

1) GEST contains samples covering 16 specific gender stereotypes (e.g. "women are beautiful", "men are leaders") for English and 9 Slavic languages. The stereotype definitions are based on sociological research.

2) The samples allow testing NLP systems in three ways: through English prompts for masked language models, through translation from English to Slavic languages in machine translation, and through masked language model prompts in the Slavic languages. 

3) Experiments using GEST show significant and consistent gender-stereotypical reasoning across diverse NLP systems and languages. The results are robust across different models, languages, prompt templates, etc.

4) GEST enables a more granular analysis of which specific stereotypes are exhibited by NLP systems, overcoming limitations around treating gender bias as a singular concept.

In summary, GEST contributes a principled, multifaceted evaluation dataset that provides strong evidence of pervasive and nuanced gender stereotyping in major NLP systems across languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Gender stereotypes - The paper focuses on evaluating gender stereotypical reasoning in machine translation systems and language models. It defines 16 specific gender stereotypes to study.

- Gender bias - The paper aims to measure and understand gender bias that manifests as stereotypical reasoning in NLP models.

- Machine translation - One of the main NLP tasks evaluated is English-to-X machine translation across several systems.

- Language models - Both English and multilingual masked language models are evaluated using the proposed GEST dataset.

- Evaluation methodology - The paper puts emphasis on having an intuitive methodology to evaluate stereotypical reasoning based on observing models' behavior when exposed to stereotypical sentences.

- Slavic languages - The paper targets English as well as 9 Slavic languages (Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian, Croatian, Slovene, Serbian, Czech, Polish, Slovak).

- Dataset creation - The GEST dataset was manually created and contains natural sentences representing different gender stereotypes.

- Results - The results demonstrate consistent stereotypical reasoning across most of the evaluated models and languages. Specific stereotype strengths are analyzed.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new dataset called GEST for measuring gender stereotypical reasoning in NLP models. How does GEST improve upon limitations of previous datasets used for evaluating gender bias? What aspects make it more comprehensive?

2. The authors employ a two-phase methodology involving first defining 16 gender stereotypes and then collecting samples for each stereotype. What were some key considerations and steps in arriving at a consensus list of stereotypes? How was the process of sample collection standardized across stereotypes?  

3. The paper demonstrates usage of GEST to evaluate multiple machine translation systems and language models. What were some of the common themes and differences observed in terms of stereotypical associations made by these models? Which models exhibited greater vs lower amounts of bias based on measurements using GEST?

4. One interesting finding highlighted is the sexualization of women even in machine translation systems. What could potentially explain this manifestation of bias? How prevalent was this compared to occupational stereotypes captured via metrics like the stereotype rate?

5. The paper proposes the metric of "feminine ranks" to study gradations in stereotypical reasoning across the 16 categories defined in GEST. What insights do the consistency and variance around these ranks for different models reveal about the landscape of gender bias in NLP?  

6. How adaptable is the GEST methodology for evaluating gender bias in other languages and cultures? What are some limitations around cultural compatibility that need to be considered before applying GEST more broadly?

7. The results using English vs Slavic language prompts with multilingual MLMs reveal high correlation in bias trends. Does this imply fundamental flaws in foundational architectures of language models? What steps could mitigate some of these issues?

8. Were there any discrepancies found when using different templates and probing methodologies for English language models? If so, how can the consistency of measurements using GEST be further improved?  

9. One analysis reveals the influence of semantic topics superseding stereotypical associations for some samples. How prevalent do you think “topical bias” effects are? What steps could be taken to control for this?

10. The paper focuses only on binary notions of gender. How could the GEST methodology be extended to measure bias with respect to non-binary gender identities? What complexities need to be addressed?
