# [A Little Leak Will Sink a Great Ship: Survey of Transparency for Large   Language Models from Start to Finish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16139)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive web data risk leaking inappropriate data like personal information, copyrighted text, and benchmark datasets. This undermines trust in AI.

- Three key criteria are established: 
    1) Leakage rate: proportion of leaked data in training data
    2) Output rate: ease of generating leaked data 
    3) Detection rate: ability to detect leaked vs non-leaked data

- It's unclear how leakage rate affects output rate and detection rate.

Methodology: 
- Analyzed leakage rates in training data of 6 major LLMs for personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmarks.

- Created prompts to elicit leaked data from models and compared likelihood of generating leaked vs denied text. This measures output rate.  

- Proposed a self-detection method using few-shot learning to distinguish leaked from non-leaked data. Compared to likelihood thresholding methods.

Key Contributions:

- Leakage rates were highest for personal info, then copyrighted text, lowest for benchmarks. But output rates were similar across categories. Indicates even minimal leakage impacts outputs.

- Self-detection outperformed existing methods. Detection rates followed trends in leakage rates, indicating leakage rate influences detectability.  

- Relationship between leakage rate vs output/detection rate highlighted. Small leakage rates don't affect output tendencies but make detection harder. Preprocessing must balance both.

In summary, the paper analyzed how data leakage in LLMs affects outputs and detectability. The proposed self-detection method helps models identify their own training data. Key results show even minimal leakage impacts outputs, and balancing leakage rate and detection rate is necessary.
