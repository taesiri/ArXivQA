# [A Little Leak Will Sink a Great Ship: Survey of Transparency for Large   Language Models from Start to Finish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16139)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive web data risk leaking inappropriate data like personal information, copyrighted text, and benchmark datasets. This undermines trust in AI.

- Three key criteria are established: 
    1) Leakage rate: proportion of leaked data in training data
    2) Output rate: ease of generating leaked data 
    3) Detection rate: ability to detect leaked vs non-leaked data

- It's unclear how leakage rate affects output rate and detection rate.

Methodology: 
- Analyzed leakage rates in training data of 6 major LLMs for personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmarks.

- Created prompts to elicit leaked data from models and compared likelihood of generating leaked vs denied text. This measures output rate.  

- Proposed a self-detection method using few-shot learning to distinguish leaked from non-leaked data. Compared to likelihood thresholding methods.

Key Contributions:

- Leakage rates were highest for personal info, then copyrighted text, lowest for benchmarks. But output rates were similar across categories. Indicates even minimal leakage impacts outputs.

- Self-detection outperformed existing methods. Detection rates followed trends in leakage rates, indicating leakage rate influences detectability.  

- Relationship between leakage rate vs output/detection rate highlighted. Small leakage rates don't affect output tendencies but make detection harder. Preprocessing must balance both.

In summary, the paper analyzed how data leakage in LLMs affects outputs and detectability. The proposed self-detection method helps models identify their own training data. Key results show even minimal leakage impacts outputs, and balancing leakage rate and detection rate is necessary.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper conducts an experimental survey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate of inappropriate data in large language models' training data and the models' output rate and detection rate of that leaked data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Conducting an experimental survey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate (proportion of leaked data in training data) and the output rate (ease of generating leaked data) and detection rate (performance of detecting leaked data) for personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmarks leaked in large language models. 

2) Proposing a self-detection approach using few-shot learning for large language models to detect whether data points are present or absent from their training data. This showed better performance than existing detection methods.

3) Creating a dataset of prompts designed to elicit personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmarks from large language models in order to explore the ease of generating leaked information. Experiments revealed that models produce leaked information in most cases despite less such data in their training set.

4) Gaining insights that even small amounts of leaked data in training can greatly affect outputs, and that simply reducing leakage rate does not necessarily improve the situation - it is necessary to balance leakage rate and detection rate.

In summary, the main contribution is conducting an extensive experimental analysis to reveal the relationship between leakage rate, output rate, and detection rate of leaked data in large language models.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed self-detection method allow target language models to detect whether data points are in their own training data? What machine learning technique does it employ?

2. What are the key differences between the proposed self-detection approach and existing detection methods like LOSS, PPL/zlib, and Min-K%? How does self-detection try to address their limitations? 

3. The paper establishes leakage rate, output rate and detection rate as key criteria. How are these criteria defined? What is the relationship explored between them through experiments in the paper?

4. What datasets were used to calculate leakage rates of personal information, copyrighted texts and benchmarks? What methods were used to determine if leakage occurred?

5. How were the leaked text and denied text datasets created to calculate output rates? What was the process used to generate appropriate prompts eliciting leaked information?

6. How exactly is few-shot learning used in the self-detection approach? What is the structure of the prompt used for detection through few-shot learning?

7. What trends were observed in output rates across models with and without instruction tuning? How did output rates vary across leakage of personal information versus copyrighted texts and benchmarks?

8. How did detection rates correlate with leakage rates for different targets? Why does the paper hypothesize higher leakage rates lead to better detection performance?  

9. What was the process used in analyzing self-detection versus using GPT-4 for leak detection? What key insight did this analysis provide about the self-detection approach?
