# [UniLiDAR: Bridge the domain gap among different LiDARs for continual   learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08512)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing LiDAR-based 3D perception models are trained and tested on single datasets, which limits their generalization capability. When deployed to new datasets or platforms with different LiDARs, they suffer from significant performance degradation. 
- This is due to substantial domain gaps across datasets in terms of (1) geometric discrepancies from variations in LiDAR beams, point densities etc. (2) inconsistent semantic label spaces caused by taxonomy differences.
- Annotating new target domain data or fine-tuning on new datasets leads to catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge. 

Proposed Solution: 
- This paper proposes UniLiDAR, a 3D occupancy prediction framework to bridge domain gaps across LiDAR datasets and enable continual learning.
- It has two key components:
   1. Geometric realignment module: Aligns point cloud ranges and applies dataset-specific normalization to encapsulate unique statistics of each dataset.
   2. Semantic label mapping: Learns a unified label space across datasets automatically based on output similarities using combinatorial optimization.

- These components allow the model to handle different LiDAR datasets in a shared framework with dataset-specific heads.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to enable continual learning across multiple LiDAR datasets for 3D dense prediction tasks.
- Achieves significantly improved performance over single dataset baselines and SOTA methods on OpenOccupancy-nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets.  
- Enhances model's generalization capability and reduces costs for cross-LiDAR deployment, without needing new target domain annotation or fine-tuning.
- Core ideas can be integrated into other 3D perception models to enhance their adaptability and performance across diverse data.

In summary, UniLiDAR pioneers multi-LiDAR continual learning for 3D scene understanding and demonstrates improved robustness via effective domain gap bridging techniques.
