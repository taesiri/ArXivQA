# [Bridging Text and Molecule: A Survey on Multimodal Frameworks for   Molecule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13830)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Modeling molecules and extracting meaningful features is challenging in molecular deep learning. Current models lack a deep understanding of chemical domain knowledge and need a large amount of labeled data for training. Recently, multimodal learning and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in modeling and inference. Bridging textual information with molecules provides an opportunity to enhance molecular representations. However, there lacks a systematic review of recent progress in this emerging field.

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents the first survey on multimodal frameworks for molecules. It provides a structured taxonomy to categorize models based on their architecture: single-stream models that treat molecules as languages, and multi-stream models that process modalities separately. Various pre-training tasks are introduced for latent space alignment, including contrastive learning, conditional generation, and masked language modeling. The paper also summarizes prompting techniques to adapt LLMs for molecular tasks, including prompt-based tuning, instruction tuning, in-context learning and chain-of-thought. It showcases applications empowered by text-molecule alignment in drug discovery, such as retrieval, property prediction, molecule design and reaction prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Provides an overview of multimodal frameworks for molecules with a structured taxonomy of model architectures and pre-training strategies
- Presents a systematic review of training techniques, dataset construction methods and applications
- Summarizes prompting methods to bridge LLMs with molecular tasks 
- Discusses limitations in this field and highlights several future directions, including needs for high-quality data and benchmarks, improving model interpretability and reasoning skills, integrating foundation models, and learning from human/AI feedback.

The paper delivers valuable insights into an emerging research field. The proposed future outlooks will facilitate more reliable and interpretable multimodal frameworks for molecules.
