# [Generalization Analysis of Policy Networks: An Example of   Double-Integrator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies often degrade in performance when deployed in expanded state spaces outside of their training environment. For example, an agent that can navigate well in a 32x32 grid struggles when the grid size increases to 64x64. 
- The root causes of this performance degradation are not well understood. Most prior solutions involve techniques like domain randomization or policy fine-tuning, but do not provide interpretable explanations.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper introduces a novel state space division theory to analyze and interpret DRL policies, specifically to understand performance degradation issues. 
- The key idea is that DRL policies divide the state space into linear division boundaries or "strips". In proximal states near the origin, these boundaries are nonlinear due to the unsaturated tanh activation. But in distant states, the activations saturate and boundaries become linear.
- As state norms grow large, policies resemble bang-bang control separated into +/- maximum acceleration regions. However, the linear boundaries prevent approximating the ideal nonlinear bang-bang controller, leading to unavoidable overshoot problems.

Contributions:
- Provides formal mathematical theory and definitions to describe state space division boundaries based on policy network parameters. 
- Empirically demonstrates emergence of linear boundaries as a universal intrinsic phenomenon stemming from network saturation, independent of RL optimization algorithm.
- Shows through case studies that linearity causes inability to achieve time-optimal bang-bang control, forcing policies to overshoot, especially from larger initial errors.
- Overall, explains a core reason why policy performance degrades in expanded spaces, due to intrinsic limitations in approximating ideal nonlinear controllers.

In summary, the paper offers a novel and formalized perspective into interpreting reinforcement learning policies via state space divisions, and leverages this perspective to uncover fundamental performance limitations in generalizing policies to distal spaces.
