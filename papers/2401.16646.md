# [Incoherent Probability Judgments in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate coherent text, but are their probability judgments equally coherent? 
- This paper evaluates the coherence of probability judgments made by LLMs using probabilistic identities and repeated judgments.

Methods:
- 4 LLMs tested: GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, LLaMA-2-70b, LLaMA-2-7b.
- LLMs were asked to estimate probabilities of 24 pairs of future events in weather and politics. 
- Probabilities combined into identities that should equal 0 if coherent. 
- Same prompts were resubmitted 5 times to assess variability.

Results:
- LLMs showed incoherence in identities mirroring systematic biases seen in humans.
- Positive/negative term imbalance influenced extent of deviation.
- Mean-variance relationship of repeated judgments had inverted U shape resembling humans.  
- Increased model size correlated with enhanced coherence.

Proposed Explanation:
- Link autoregressive process in LLMs to implicit Bayesian inference using de Finetti's theorem.
- Draw parallels to Bayesian Sampler model of human probability judgments.
- Incoherence arises from repeated use of priors when approximating underlying event probabilities.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates LLMs exhibit human-like incoherence in probability judgments
- Proposes Bayesian Sampler model better explains LLM behavior than alternative PT+N  
- Establishes framework to improve LLM coherence and enhance reliability of AI systems

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem, methods, results, proposed explanation and contributions. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper assesses the coherence of probability judgments made by large language models using probabilistic identities and repeated judgments, finding human-like deviations from rationality that may arise from the autoregressive training objective linking these models to Bayesian inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper provides empirical evidence that the probability judgments made by large language models (LLMs) exhibit similar patterns of incoherence as those observed in human probability judgments. Specifically:

1) When LLMs' probability judgments for related events are combined into probabilistic identities, the identities deviate from zero in a systematic way that mirrors human biases based on the balance of positive and negative terms. 

2) The relationship between mean and variance of repeated probability judgments made by LLMs for the same event resembles an inverted U-shape, akin to patterns seen in human judgments.

The paper proposes that these shared deviations from rationality likely stem from the autoregressive training process used by LLMs. A connection is drawn between autoregression and the Bayesian Sampler model of human probability judgments. Overall, the work demonstrates that LLMs display human-like incoherence in probability reasoning and provides a hypothesis for the underlying mechanism based on implicit Bayesian inference.

- Mean-variance relationship

The paper examines the coherence of probability judgments made by large language models, using probabilistic identities and repeated judgments to quantitatively assess the coherence. It draws parallels between the patterns of incoherence observed in LLMs and human probability judgments, proposing connections between the autoregressive processes in LLMs and Bayesian inference models of human judgments. The keywords listed cover the main concepts, models, and methods discussed in analyzing the coherence of probability judgments from LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes linking autoregressive language models to implicit Bayesian inference as an explanation for the observed incoherence in probability judgments. What are the key assumptions required to establish this link theoretically? How valid are these assumptions?

2. The Bayesian Sampler model is offered as a potential computational-level account of the incoherence patterns. What are other candidate Bayesian models that could explain the results? What evidence would help adjudicate between these accounts? 

3. What are the implications of the proposed Bayesian account regarding the origins of incoherence in language models? Does it suggest the incoherence is an unavoidable byproduct or could training procedures be altered to improve coherence?

4. The paper analyzes incoherence using probabilistic identities and repeated judgments. What other techniques from the judgment and decision-making literature could be fruitfully applied to study coherence in language models?

5. What range of probability judgment tasks and prompts should be used to comprehensively evaluate the incoherence of language models? Are the current sets of prompts sufficient or biased in some way?

6. The paper studies only English language models. How would you expect incoherence patterns to change in multilingual models? What cross-linguistic differences could emerge? 

7. What modifications need to be made to scale up the analysis - for example, to safely evaluate incoherence in models with open-ended conversational capabilities?

8. The paper suggests practical ways of leveraging incoherence measures to improve probability outputs. What empirical evidence is needed to support using coherence rather than calibration for this purpose?

9. How sensitive are the observed incoherence results to factors like model size, data, search algorithm, and other architectural choices? What probing experiments could isolate these factors?

10. The analysis relies on numerical probability estimates from language models. How would evaluations differ if asking for qualitative or comparative judgments instead? What biases might this introduce?
