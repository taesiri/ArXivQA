# [Learning Sampling Distribution and Safety Filter for Autonomous Driving   with VQ-VAE and Differentiable Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sampling trajectories from a distribution and then ranking them based on cost is a common approach in autonomous driving. But typically the sampling distribution is handcrafted (e.g. Gaussian) which fails to capture multi-modality of driving behaviors.
- Recently Conditional VAE (CVAE) has been used to learn the sampling distribution, but it suffers from posterior collapse and inadequately captures multi-modality. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use a Vector Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) instead, whose discrete latent space is well-suited to represent multi-modal distributions. Train it on expert trajectories.
- Also train a PixelCNN to generate conditional samples from the VQ-VAE's discrete latent space based on environment observations.
- Add a differentiable QP layer in the VQ-VAE decoder to produce an interpretable representation of velocity and lateral offset setpoints.
- Propose an optimization-based safety filter to ensure collision avoidance and lane boundary constraints. It uses barrier functions and is trained in a self-supervised manner to learn good initialization and parameters.

Key Contributions:
- Show VQ-VAE captures multi-modal trajectory distribution much better than CVAE baseline, enabling better performance in complex scenarios.
- Propose novel differentiable safety filter based on barrier functions that learns parameters and initialization through self-supervision.
- Achieve up to 12x lower collision rate compared to prior CVAE-based method, while maintaining good speed.
- Show approach maintains good performance even with reduced compute/sampling budget.

In summary, the key idea is to use VQ-VAE and a learned safety filter for multi-modal sampling and safety in autonomous driving. The method achieves better performance than CVAE-based approaches.
