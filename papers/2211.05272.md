# [GAPartNet: Cross-Category Domain-Generalizable Object Perception and   Manipulation via Generalizable and Actionable Parts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05272)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable robots to perceive and interact with objects in a generalizable way across different object categories, including unseen categories. 

Specifically, the paper proposes learning "generalizable and actionable parts" (GAParts) as a way to achieve cross-category generalization in object perception and manipulation. The key hypothesis is that identifying parts with consistent semantics, geometry, and interaction patterns will allow developing models and policies that transfer better to novel objects compared to category-level approaches.

The main contributions to test this hypothesis are:

- Proposing the concept of GAParts and defining 9 common GAPart classes with consistent semantics and actionability across objects.

- Constructing a large-scale dataset called GAPartNet with semantic and pose labels for GAParts across 27 object categories.

- Developing a method for cross-category 3D part segmentation and pose estimation by learning domain-invariant features via adversarial training.

- Showing that simple heuristics based on estimated GAPart poses enable manipulating unseen object categories in simulation and real-world.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a focus on GAParts can enable more generalizable object perception and manipulation. The paper aims to demonstrate this through dataset construction, new technical approaches for part-based vision and interaction, and applications to cross-category tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting the concept of Generalizable and Actionable Parts (GAParts) and using them for cross-category object perception and manipulation. Specifically:

- The paper proposes the GAPart definition, which identifies part classes that are both visually recognizable across object categories and have consistent actionability for manipulation. Based on this, 9 GAPart classes are defined.

- The paper constructs a large-scale interactive dataset called GAPartNet, with semantic and pose annotations for over 8,000 GAPart instances across 27 object categories. This enables research on generalizable part perception and manipulation. 

- For cross-category part segmentation and pose estimation, the paper proposes a domain generalization approach with adversarial learning to extract domain-invariant features. This method outperforms prior works significantly.

- Leveraging the GAPart definition, the paper designs simple heuristics for pose-based manipulation that generalizes to novel objects. This is shown both in simulation and real-world experiments on unseen categories. 

In summary, the key contribution is using the new concept of GAParts to achieve cross-category generalizable object perception and manipulation, supported by a new dataset, learning methods, and manipulation heuristics. The GAPart representation and the notion of learning generalizable parts are the main novelties proposed.
