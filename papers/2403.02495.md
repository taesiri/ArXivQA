# [Pseudo-Labeling and Contextual Curriculum Learning for Online Grasp   Learning in Robotic Bin Picking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02495)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper addresses the problem of online grasp learning for robotic bin picking tasks. Most existing methods rely on offline training and may not adapt well to new objects or environmental conditions. 

- During online learning, the robot only receives sparse reward feedback (grasp success/failure) at the pixel location selected by the current policy. This is challenging as the loss is only backpropagated through one pixel, limiting learning efficiency.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new approach called SSL-ConvSAC that combines semi-supervised learning (SSL) and reinforcement learning. It treats the pixel with reward feedback as labeled data and other pixels as unlabeled data.

- SSL-ConvSAC introduces a consistency regularization loss to exploit unlabeled pixels and improve learning. It enables integrating SSL techniques like FixMatch and curriculum learning methods.

- A contextual curriculum learning approach is proposed to handle the extreme imbalance between labeled (1 pixel) and unlabeled data, which can otherwise cause training divergence. This uses lower-bounded thresholds and soft-weighting.

Main Contributions:
- First work to address the sparse reward feedback problem in online grasp learning through SSL. Enables exploiting unlabeled data.

- Flexible framework SSL-ConvSAC that can integrate different SSL algorithms like FixMatch, FlexMatch, etc.

- Contextual curriculum learning method to mitigate extreme data imbalance issue between labeled and unlabeled data.

- Evaluated on a real robot system and demonstration of improved online grasp learning performance - achieved 90% grasp success rate.
