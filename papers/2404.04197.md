# [Convex MPC and Thrust Allocation with Deadband for Spacecraft Rendezvous](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper focuses on the problem of controlling a chaser spacecraft to rendezvous with a target spacecraft in orbit. Specifically, the goal is to design a model predictive control (MPC) approach that can guide the chaser to the target efficiently. 

- A key challenge is that the thrusters on the spacecraft have a minimum impulse bit or minimum activation time constraint, which introduces mixed-integer constraints into the MPC optimization problem. This results in exponential complexity that makes solving the optimization problem computationally intractable for real-time application onboard a spacecraft.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two customized MPC solver algorithms - "Projected" and "Relaxed" - that can efficiently approximate the optimal solution without exploring the entire mixed-integer search space.

- The Projected algorithm sequentially solves relaxed convex problems to decide which thrusters to activate, adding integrality constraints progressively until a feasible solution is obtained.

- The Relaxed algorithm simply solves a fully relaxed convex version of the MPC optimization by ignoring all integer constraints, and then projects the obtained non-integer control solution onto the feasible space.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates the application of MPC for spacecraft rendezvous guidance and control, implicitly handling thruster allocation while minimizing fuel consumption.

- Proposes two computationally efficient approximate MPC solver algorithms that can produce near optimal solutions in significantly less time compared to standard MIP solvers.

- Shows through simulations that the proposed solvers generate similar performance to the optimal MIP solution in terms of trajectory, fuel use and computational time.

- Establishes that the proposed algorithms enable real-time implementation of MPC for spacecraft rendezvous by avoiding exponential complexity arising from mixed-integer constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two efficient algorithms for solving model predictive control of spacecraft rendezvous with mixed-integer constraints arising from minimum thruster activation times.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two solver algorithms, called Projected and Relaxed, that efficiently approximate the optimal solution to the mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that arises from applying model predictive control (MPC) to spacecraft rendezvous. Specifically, the paper shows that these algorithms can produce near-optimal solutions in significantly less time compared to standard MINLP solvers, making them suitable for real-time applications of MPC for spacecraft rendezvous despite the computational complexity introduced by the integer constraints on the spacecraft thruster actuators. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using a convex relaxation approach to address the MINLP in this application instead of relying on more computationally expensive branch-and-bound algorithms.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two algorithms, Projected and Relaxed, to efficiently solve the mixed-integer optimization problem that arises from the minimum impulse constraints on the thrusters. Can you explain in detail the key ideas behind each of these algorithms and how they differ? 

2. Both proposed algorithms are approximations that do not guarantee finding the optimal solution. What is the rationale behind using an approximate method rather than an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver? Discuss the tradeoffs.

3. The simulation results show that the trajectories obtained from the Projected and Relaxed algorithms closely match those from the Standard MIP solver. Analyze these results - why might the optimal trajectories not exploit the full expressiveness of mixed-integer constraints?

4. The paper linearizes the discrete-time model to obtain an affine model. Explain this linearization step and discuss whether it could impact the optimality of solutions. How could the accuracy of the linearization be improved?

5. The cost function aims to minimize state error and control effort. Propose some alternative cost functions that could be relevant for the rendezvous problem and discuss the benefits and downsides of each.  

6. The Clohessy-Wiltshire equations are used to simplify the relative motion model. What assumptions go into these equations? When might they become invalid? Discuss the impact on the MPC controller.

7. The simulation results show increasing and more variable computation times for the MIP solver as the rendezvous progresses. Analyze the possible reasons behind this trend.

8. How could the proposed method be extended to deal with constraints on thruster usage and capabilities, such as limits on the number of switchings? 

9. The method assumes perfect state information is available. Discuss how the performance would change under noisy measurements or uncertainty in model parameters.

10. The paper focuses only on the far-range rendezvous phase. What changes would be needed to apply this method to the entire rendezvous process, including docking?
