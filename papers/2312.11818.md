# [Root Cause Explanation of Outliers under Noisy Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing root cause analysis (RCA) methods for identifying anomalies in causal processes assume noise-free connections between nodes. However, in real systems like computer networks, anomalies can originate from noisy/faulty connections.  
- Existing RCA methods become computationally intractable for large graphs due to reliance on Shapley values requiring summation over all possible subsets.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce noisy functional causal models that allow inferring noise in both nodes and connections (edges) of the causal graph. This enables identifying if anomaly arises from node or edge.
- Propose Bayesian Integrated Gradient of Edge and Node noise (BIGEN) for efficiently attributing an observed leaf anomaly score to ancestor nodes and edges. BIGEN integrates gradient between reference and target noise instead of summation over subsets.

Key Contributions:
- Framework to identify root causes of anomalies originating from both nodes and connections. Can reduce operational costs by early detection. 
- Model uncertainty in connections via Bayesian linear regression to enable inference of edge noises.
- Efficient integrated gradient based method BIGEN that scales linearly in number of nodes/edges for anomaly attribution.
- Demonstrated improved performance over baselines on simulated and real-world data from computer network and supply chain domains. BIGEN also has significantly lower computation time.

In summary, the paper introduces modeling of noisy connections in causal graphs to enable identifying anomalies originating from both nodes and connections. The proposed BIGEN method also provides efficient anomaly attribution that scales to large graphs. Experiments validate improvements over state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework to identify root causes of outliers in complex systems by modeling uncertainty in both nodes and edges of causal graphs and attributing an observed outlier score to anomalous ancestors using an efficient integrated gradient method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A framework for identifying the sources of changes in both nodes and edges to reduce operational costs. 

2. Modelling the causal connections using Bayesian linear regression to enable the inference of edge noises and applying the Shapley-based attribution framework.

3. Introducing a new causal contribution score called BIGEN to efficiently attribute a leaf anomaly to the ancestor nodes and edges. 

4. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods on random graph datasets and two real-world scenario datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a method to identify root causes of anomalies that can originate from changes in both nodes and edges of a causal graph. This is done by modeling edge noises, inferring them along with node noises, and attributing an anomaly score to ancestors using an efficient integrated gradient based method called BIGEN. The effectiveness of this method is shown on synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a noisy functional causal model to account for noise in both nodes and edges of a causal graph. How does modeling edge noise in addition to node noise enhance the ability to identify root causes compared to only modeling node noise?

2. The paper employs Bayesian linear regression to model the noisy causal mechanisms. What are the advantages of using a Bayesian approach here compared to a frequentist approach? How does the Bayesian view align with the overall framework?

3. The paper reparameterizes the target variable as a function of the node and edge noises. Why is this noise-dependent reparameterization useful? How does it facilitate the subsequent attribution algorithms? 

4. Explain in detail the process used to estimate the edge and node noises from the abnormal batch of observations. What assumptions are made and why?

5. The integrated gradient method is used to compute the BIGEN attribution scores. Walk through the mathematical details of how the integrated gradient is adapted to handle both node and edge noises. What is the intuition behind this approach?

6. Compare and contrast the integrated gradient approach used in BIGEN with the baseline Shapley value methods. What are the computational and performance advantages of BIGEN over the Shapley methods?

7. The experiments show lower performance in attributing anomalies to noisy edges compared to anomalous nodes. Why might identifying the root causes be more difficult when edge anomalies are present?

8. The paper demonstrates linear scaling of BIGEN even for causal graphs with thousands of nodes. Explain how the computation complexity grows for the Shapley methods and why BIGEN does not suffer from this exponential growth.

9. The method assumes the causal graph structure is given. How could the performance change if there is uncertainty in the causal structure? What modifications would be needed to handle causal discovery jointly with root cause explanation?

10. The paper focuses on explaining outliers observed at a target leaf node. How could the BIGEN method be extended to handle multiple simultaneous outliers observed at multiple leaves in the graph? What additional complexities might arise?
