# [NoMAD-Attention: Efficient LLM Inference on CPUs Through   Multiply-add-free Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01273)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language model (LLM) inference is very expensive on CPUs due to the vast quantities of multiply-add (MAD) operations required for attention mechanism computations. 
- Attention computations scale quadratically with sequence length, quickly overwhelming CPU compute capabilities.
- CPUs have limited parallel compute cores and are inefficient for highly repetitive workloads like attention. Thus attention computations become a key bottleneck.

Solution: 
- The paper proposes NoMAD-Attention, which eliminates most MAD operations in attention through fast in-register lookups by exploiting the SIMD registers in CPUs.
- NoMAD-Attention uses product quantization to transform dot products in attention to memory lookups. It constrains codebook sizes to allow lookup tables (LUTs) to fit into SIMD registers for fast access.
- The key cache memory layout is reorganized into a transposed, blocked format to enable batch parallel lookups using SIMD shuffle instructions.  

Key Contributions:
- Proposes NoMAD-Attention to replace expensive MAD operations in attention with fast in-register LUT lookups, enabling efficient CPU inference.
- Achieves up to 2x speedup on 4-bit quantized LLaMA-7B model at 16k context length without loss of accuracy.
- First work to accelerate attention computations by shifting compute paradigm from MAD to lookup using SIMD registers.
- Hardware-aware memory layout reorganization and codebook design to overcome limitations of SIMD registers.
- Compatible with pre-trained attention-based transformers without model fine-tuning.

In summary, the paper makes LLMs more accessible by enabling their efficient deployment on prevalent CPU hardware through a novel MAD-free attention mechanism designed specifically for efficient in-register lookup computation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NoMAD-Attention, a novel attention algorithm for large language model inference on CPUs that replaces expensive multiply-add operations with fast in-register lookups to achieve up to 2x speedup without sacrificing model quality or requiring finetuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Identifying the extensive multiply-add (MAD) operations in attention as the bottleneck for CPU inference of large language models (LLMs), and exploring the opportunity to mitigate this bottleneck by replacing MAD operations with fast in-register lookups using SIMD registers. 

2. Introducing NoMAD-Attention, a MAD-free framework for attention computation in pre-trained attention-based LLMs. NoMAD-Attention uses hardware-aware algorithmic designs to enable accurate and fast estimation of query-key dot products through in-register lookups, despite the limited capacity of SIMD registers.

3. Demonstrating through experiments that NoMAD-Attention maintains the quality of original LLMs well while achieving considerable speedups. For example, NoMAD-Attention achieves up to 2x speedup on 4-bit quantized LLaMA-7B models at a context length of 16k tokens.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing NoMAD-Attention to accelerate LLM inference on CPUs by replacing expensive MAD operations in attention with fast in-register lookups, while maintaining model quality. This is achieved through careful hardware-aware algorithm design.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions replacing MAD operations with in-register lookups to speed up attention. Can you elaborate on the specifics of how the MAD operations are replaced? What data structures and algorithms enable the replacement?

2. The use of product quantization to transform dot products into lookups is a key aspect. Can you explain in more detail how the asymmetric distance computation with product quantization allows the estimation of dot products? 

3. The paper constrains the codebook size to 16 centroids per sub-quantizer. What is the impact of this constraint? How does it affect the accuracy of the dot product estimations? Could using more centroids improve quality?

4. The paper reorganizes the key cache into a transposed blocked format. What is the motivation behind this? How does it help enable efficient batched lookups? 

5. NoMAD attention seems compatible as a drop-in replacement for standard attention. What modifications need to be made to the surrounding model architecture or software to enable NoMAD attention?

6. How does NoMAD attention handle multi-head attention? Does it quantize and lookup in parallel per head? Or is there key sharing across heads?

7. The paper demonstrates significant speedups on CodeLLaMA models. How do you think the speedups would translate to other model architectures besides LLaMA models?

8. How does the efficiency of NoMAD attention scale with increasing sequence length? Is there a context length where it would become slower than standard attention?

9. The paper uses K-means to learn the codebook centroids. What other clustering algorithms could be used? Would neural network based vectors quantization work better?

10. NoMAD attention reduces accesses to cache and RAM by utilizing registers. Besides improving speed, what are other advantages of minimizing memory accesses? Could it help make LLMs more energy efficient?
