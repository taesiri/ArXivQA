# [Centroid-Based Efficient Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding achieves state-of-the-art translation quality by maximizing the expected metric score between translation hypotheses and references. 
- However, it requires quadratic time complexity as it computes scores between every hypothesis and every reference. This is inefficient for a large number of hypotheses.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose centroid-based MBR (CBMBR) to improve speed.
- Encode all hypothesis and reference sentences into vectors using COMET. 
- Cluster reference vectors into k centroids using k-means++ for better initialization.
- Compute expected COMET score between each hypothesis and the k centroids instead of all references.  
- Reduces time complexity from O(N^2) to O(Nk).

Main Contributions:
- CBMBR decoding achieves a 6.9x speedup in expected score computation over vanilla MBR.
- It also improves COMET score by up to 0.5% over MBR on WMT translation tasks.
- Analysis shows CBMBR is more robust to multimodal distributions of candidates compared to MBR.
- Confirm sentence embeddings of COMET correlate well with semantic similarity despite not being trained on that objective.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient approximate CBMBR decoding method that speeds up computation while also improving translation quality compared to vanilla MBR. The key ideas are to cluster reference sentences and leverage COMET's implicit learning of semantic similarity.
