# [3D Hand Pose Estimation in Egocentric Images in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06583)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents WildHands, a method for robust 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images captured in unconstrained real-world settings. A key challenge it tackles is the ambiguity in perceiving 3D hand shape from cropped image regions due to varying perspective distortion. The authors analyze this crop-induced shape ambiguity on the ARCTIC dataset and show that encoding information about the crop's location in the image can help resolve it. WildHands uses such a positional encoding based on camera intrinsics. Since 3D annotations are unavailable for in-the-wild images, WildHands also employs auxiliary 2D supervision from segmentation masks and grasp type labels on internet videos to improve generalization. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on the ARCTIC benchmark and significantly better 2D keypoint accuracy compared to a robust baseline method on a newly collected in-the-wild dataset called EPIC-Hands. The use of crops, positional encoding, multi-dataset training and auxiliary supervision enables WildHands to effectively estimate 3D hand poses in unconstrained images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents WildHands, a method for robust 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images in the wild by using crops, camera position encoding, and auxiliary supervision from in-the-wild data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

(1) Presenting WildHands, a system for 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images in the wild. 

(2) Collecting EpicHands, a dataset containing 2D hand keypoint annotations on 5K egocentric images from the in-the-wild Epic+VISOR dataset to evaluate 2D projections of estimated 3D hand poses.

(3) WildHands achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ARCTIC egocentric benchmark and improves by 45.3% over FrankMocap on the EpicHands dataset for 2D hand pose evaluation.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a novel 3D hand pose estimation system (WildHands) tailored for in-the-wild egocentric images, collecting a new dataset (EpicHands) for evaluating such methods, and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks as well as the newly collected dataset.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- 3D hand pose estimation - The paper focuses on predicting the 3D shape, articulation, and camera-relative placement of hands from egocentric RGB images.

- In-the-wild images - The goal is to develop methods that work effectively on real-world, unconstrained images rather than just controlled lab datasets.

- Perspective distortion ambiguity - The paper analyzes an ambiguity in perceiving 3D hand shape from cropped image regions due to ignoring perspective distortion. 

- Auxiliary supervision - The method uses auxiliary 2D ground truth like segmentation masks and grasp labels on in-the-wild data to complement 3D pose supervision from lab datasets.

- Multi-dataset training - The model is trained jointly on multiple datasets with different types of supervision signals.

- Intrinsics-aware encoding - An encoding based on camera intrinsics is used to provide information about an image crop's location to disambiguate distortion-related shape ambiguity.

- Egocentric interactions - A focus is hand-object interactions captured from a first-person viewpoint in the wild.

The key ideas revolve around tackling challenges like domain shift, lack of 3D ground truth, and perspective distortion for 3D hand analysis in unconstrained images.
