# [3D Hand Pose Estimation in Egocentric Images in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06583)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents WildHands, a method for robust 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images captured in unconstrained real-world settings. A key challenge it tackles is the ambiguity in perceiving 3D hand shape from cropped image regions due to varying perspective distortion. The authors analyze this crop-induced shape ambiguity on the ARCTIC dataset and show that encoding information about the crop's location in the image can help resolve it. WildHands uses such a positional encoding based on camera intrinsics. Since 3D annotations are unavailable for in-the-wild images, WildHands also employs auxiliary 2D supervision from segmentation masks and grasp type labels on internet videos to improve generalization. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on the ARCTIC benchmark and significantly better 2D keypoint accuracy compared to a robust baseline method on a newly collected in-the-wild dataset called EPIC-Hands. The use of crops, positional encoding, multi-dataset training and auxiliary supervision enables WildHands to effectively estimate 3D hand poses in unconstrained images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents WildHands, a method for robust 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images in the wild by using crops, camera position encoding, and auxiliary supervision from in-the-wild data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

(1) Presenting WildHands, a system for 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images in the wild. 

(2) Collecting EpicHands, a dataset containing 2D hand keypoint annotations on 5K egocentric images from the in-the-wild Epic+VISOR dataset to evaluate 2D projections of estimated 3D hand poses.

(3) WildHands achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ARCTIC egocentric benchmark and improves by 45.3% over FrankMocap on the EpicHands dataset for 2D hand pose evaluation.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a novel 3D hand pose estimation system (WildHands) tailored for in-the-wild egocentric images, collecting a new dataset (EpicHands) for evaluating such methods, and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks as well as the newly collected dataset.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- 3D hand pose estimation - The paper focuses on predicting the 3D shape, articulation, and camera-relative placement of hands from egocentric RGB images.

- In-the-wild images - The goal is to develop methods that work effectively on real-world, unconstrained images rather than just controlled lab datasets.

- Perspective distortion ambiguity - The paper analyzes an ambiguity in perceiving 3D hand shape from cropped image regions due to ignoring perspective distortion. 

- Auxiliary supervision - The method uses auxiliary 2D ground truth like segmentation masks and grasp labels on in-the-wild data to complement 3D pose supervision from lab datasets.

- Multi-dataset training - The model is trained jointly on multiple datasets with different types of supervision signals.

- Intrinsics-aware encoding - An encoding based on camera intrinsics is used to provide information about an image crop's location to disambiguate distortion-related shape ambiguity.

- Egocentric interactions - A focus is hand-object interactions captured from a first-person viewpoint in the wild.

The key ideas revolve around tackling challenges like domain shift, lack of 3D ground truth, and perspective distortion for 3D hand analysis in unconstrained images.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Estimating 3D hand pose from egocentric images captured in unconstrained real-world settings is very challenging. Existing methods do not work well for such in-the-wild images due to:
(1) Large perspective distortion since hands are close to the camera 
(2) Poor visual signal - occlusion, blurring, low resolution
(3) Lack of 3D pose annotation outside of controlled lab settings

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a method called "WildHands" that addresses the above challenges. The key ideas are:

1) Use crops around hands instead of full images to get finer details. However, cropping leads to loss of information about hand's location in the image, which creates ambiguity in the 3D pose. So they encode the crop's location in image using a position encoding method called Intrinsics-aware Positional Encoding (IPE) to mitigate this ambiguity.

2) Use auxiliary 2D supervision from in-the-wild datasets - segmentation masks and grasp labels to train the network, along with 3D supervision from lab datasets. This helps improve generalization.

Main Contributions:

1) Identify perspective distortion induced shape ambiguity when using hand crops as input and mitigate it using IPE encoding of crop's location

2) Use auxiliary supervision - segmentation and grasp labels on real-world datasets along with 3D supervision on lab datasets

3) Proposed WildHands method outperforms state-of-the-art on multiple datasets - gets best results on ARCTIC benchmark, beats FrankMocap by 45% on new EgoHands dataset collected from Epic dataset.

4) Collect EgoHands dataset with 2D annotations on 5K real-world egocentric images for evaluation.

In summary, the paper presents an effective way to leverage multiple sources of supervision to estimate accurate 3D hand poses from highly challenging real-world egocentric images.
