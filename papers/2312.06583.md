# [3D Hand Pose Estimation in Egocentric Images in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06583)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents WildHands, a method for robust 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images captured in unconstrained real-world settings. A key challenge it tackles is the ambiguity in perceiving 3D hand shape from cropped image regions due to varying perspective distortion. The authors analyze this crop-induced shape ambiguity on the ARCTIC dataset and show that encoding information about the crop's location in the image can help resolve it. WildHands uses such a positional encoding based on camera intrinsics. Since 3D annotations are unavailable for in-the-wild images, WildHands also employs auxiliary 2D supervision from segmentation masks and grasp type labels on internet videos to improve generalization. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on the ARCTIC benchmark and significantly better 2D keypoint accuracy compared to a robust baseline method on a newly collected in-the-wild dataset called EPIC-Hands. The use of crops, positional encoding, multi-dataset training and auxiliary supervision enables WildHands to effectively estimate 3D hand poses in unconstrained images.
