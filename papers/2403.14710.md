# [Use of recommendation models to provide support to dyslexic students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14710)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dyslexia is a common learning disorder that impairs reading, writing, and other cognitive abilities. This negatively impacts the learning experience of dyslexic students.
- Dyslexia symptoms and difficulties can vary widely between individuals, so personalized support is needed rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
- There is a lack of customized AI-based tools to recommend personalized learning strategies and support methods to university students with dyslexia.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a collaborative filtering recommendation system to suggest the most suitable learning tools and strategies to dyslexic students based on their individual needs and preferences. 
- Compare performance of user-based, item-based, and hybrid recommendation algorithms paired with Pearson, Euclidean, and Cosine similarity metrics.
- Train and test algorithms on dataset of 1237 dyslexic students' self-reported ratings of 39 learning tools/strategies.
- Evaluate real-world impact by having students utilize recommendation system during studying and comparing their learning performance.

Key Contributions:
- Showed an optimized hybrid recommendation algorithm can effectively suggest useful learning tools and strategies to dyslexic students with low error rate of 11.93%.
- Achieved high precision of 0.85 and recall of 0.83 in recommending relevant and personalized suggestions.
- Demonstrated real-world usefulness - dyslexic students following recommendations improved grades by ~1 point on 10-point scale.
- First personalized AI methodology specifically aimed at supporting university students with dyslexia during learning.
- Opened up potential for using customized recommendation systems to aid other students beyond just those with dyslexia.

In summary, the paper presented a personalized recommendation system to effectively suggest tailored learning strategies to dyslexic students, demonstrated strong performance of the optimized algorithm, and showed via real-world testing that following its suggestions improves dyslexic students' learning.
