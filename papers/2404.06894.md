# [O-TALC: Steps Towards Combating Oversegmentation within Online Action   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Online temporal action segmentation is useful for real-time human-robot interaction tasks, but existing approaches have issues with poor boundary predictions and oversegmentation. Offline segmentation methods using two-stage models are not suitable for real-time applications. Prior online methods based on sliding window action recognition models focus on rapid detection over accurate segmentation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two improvements to facilitate online action segmentation with backbone models operated in a sliding window fashion:

1) Surround Sampling: A modified dense sampling strategy during training where input clips extend beyond ground truth segment boundaries. This matches online inference clips and improves segment boundary predictions.

2) Online Temporally Aware Label Cleaning (O-TALC): An efficient online algorithm that explicitly removes short erroneous segments falling below a minimum cutoff length to reduce oversegmentation. Static and class-based cutoff lengths are investigated.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of surround sampling to improve clip matching between training and online inference for better boundary predictions

- O-TALC algorithm to reduce oversegmentation in an online manner by tidying frame predictions 

- Surround sampling + O-TALC achieves new state-of-the-art for online segmentation on multiple datasets

- Approaches are backbone invariant so can be combined with efficient models for low-latency real-time segmentation

- Analysis shows major improvements on short action classes and boundary predictions compared to regular dense sampling

The simple yet effective contributions facilitate deploying action recognition models for improved online segmentation, with performance rivaling complex offline approaches.
