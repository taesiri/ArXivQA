# [EASYTOOL: Enhancing LLM-based Agents with Concise Tool Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06201)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have limitations in using tools to solve complex real-world tasks. A key challenge is that tool documentations from different sources are often inconsistent, redundant, and incomplete, which makes it difficult for LLMs to effectively understand and utilize tools.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "EasyTool", a method to transform diverse and lengthy tool documentations into a unified, concise "tool instruction" format. This includes:

1) Tool Description - Summarizes the tool's purpose without irrelevant details 

2) Tool Functionality Guidelines - Structured details on tool parameters and usage examples to demonstrate how to properly invoke the tool

Key Contributions:
- Analyzes deficiencies of existing tool documentations that hinder LLMs in using tools
- Proposes EasyTool to generate high-quality tool instructions from documents to facilitate tool usage
- Tool instructions significantly reduce token consumption and improve performance of tool utilization in experiments on question answering, web services, and numerical reasoning
- Shows EasyTool can generalize to boost capability of open-source LLMs in using tools, even without any documentation
- The simplified tool instructions enable state-of-the-art results on complex benchmarks requiring orchestration of multiple tools

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in enhancing tool utilization for LLM-based agents, through an effective yet simple transformation of messy tool documents into clear, unified instructions that better guide LLMs in selecting and properly executing tools. The method is shown to be widely applicable and deliver strong empirical results across diverse real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces EasyTool, a method to transform diverse and lengthy tool documentation into a unified and concise tool instruction to improve the capability of large language model-based agents in utilizing external tools.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method called "EasyTool" to transform diverse and lengthy tool documentation into a unified and concise tool instruction. The key benefits of EasyTool are:

1) It creates high-quality tool instructions from tool documentations to facilitate better tool usage in LLM-based agents. The tool instructions include standardized tool descriptions and functionalities.

2) It eliminates irrelevant content from tool documentations and keeps only the core functionality descriptions to help LLMs focus on what's needed to use the tools.

3) It provides detailed usage guidelines and examples for the tools to instruct LLMs on how to properly invoke them. 

4) Experiments on multiple datasets show EasyTool can significantly reduce token consumption and improve performance of tool utilization by LLMs in real-world applications.

In summary, the main contribution is developing EasyTool to streamline messy tool documentation into clear and structured instructions that enhance LLMs' capability for practical tool usage.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper points out three main issues with existing tool documentation - inconsistency, redundancy, and incompleteness. Could you expand more on why these issues make it difficult for LLMs to understand and use tools effectively?

2. The key idea of the proposed method is to create a unified, concise tool instruction from diverse tool documentation. What were some of the main considerations and trade-offs when designing the standardized format for the tool instructions? 

3. The tool instructions contain both tool descriptions and functionality guidelines. What is the rationale behind having both components? Would it be sufficient to just have the functionality guidelines?

4. The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness on three distinct applications - question answering, web services, and numerical reasoning. For each application, what modifications or customizations were made to the overall method?

5. The results show significant improvements across metrics like success rate, path accuracy and tool error rate. However, are there any limitations or weaknesses in evaluation that should be addressed in future work?

6. For tools without documentation, the method generates instructions using GPT-4. How robust is this approach? Could the quality of generated instructions vary significantly for different tools? 

7. The method relies on the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs. How well would it generalize to other types of models? Could the tool instructions be adapted for supervised training?

8. The paper focuses on single tool documentation. How could tool dependencies and relationships be incorporated for more complex real-world scenarios?

9. What are some of the error cases or situations where the method would fail to produce high-quality tool instructions?

10. The improved tool utilization could enable new applications for LLM-based agents. What are some promising future directions that could build on this work?
