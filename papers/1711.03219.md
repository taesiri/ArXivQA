# [Denotational validation of higher-order Bayesian inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03219)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a semantic account of Bayesian inference algorithms for probabilistic programming languages. The key research objectives are:

- To provide a modular, denotational semantics for representing and validating common Bayesian inference algorithms such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). 

- To develop mathematical tools based on category theory and synthetic measure theory that can support this modular semantics in the presence of higher-order functions and continuous probability distributions.

- To demonstrate the usefulness of the semantics by providing semantic validation for complex inference algorithms like resample-move SMC by composing the semantics of their modular components.

In essence, the central hypothesis is that a modular denotational semantics based on category theory and synthetic measure theory can provide a useful framework for specifying and verifying Bayesian inference algorithms, especially for higher-order probabilistic programming languages. The paper aims to demonstrate the viability of this approach through concrete examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a modular semantic account of Bayesian inference algorithms for probabilistic programming languages. The key ideas are:

- Using denotational semantics based on quasi-Borel spaces to give mathematical meaning to probabilistic programs and inference representations. This allows handling both discrete and continuous distributions in a unified way.

- Defining the notions of inference representations, transformations, and transformers to modularly specify and analyze inference algorithms. Representations capture different intermediate forms a probabilistic program may take during inference. Transformations prove that converting between representations preserves the meaning. Transformers encapsulate common patterns like adding weights or traces. 

- Demonstrating this semantic framework on advanced inference algorithms like sequential Monte Carlo and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. The algorithms are decomposed into simpler semantic blocks that are composed to yield the overall algorithm.

- Proving a generalized Metropolis-Hastings-Green theorem to justify the correctness of Metropolis-Hastings updates in this semantic setting.

- Showing that quasi-Borel spaces and the associated synthetic measure theory can serve as a foundation for measure-theoretic probability and Bayesian inference with higher-order functions.

Overall, the paper provides a new semantic perspective on probabilistic inference, enabling modular specification and verification of complex algorithms built compositionally from smaller validated components. The use of more abstract mathematics like category theory and denotational semantics to understand applied topics like Bayesian machine learning is novel.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents a modular semantic framework for specifying and verifying Bayesian inference algorithms for probabilistic programming languages using quasi-Borel spaces, synthetic measure theory, and higher-order functions and data types.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel denotational semantics approach for verifying Bayesian inference algorithms in probabilistic programming languages. Here are some key aspects in relation to other related work:

- Focuses on formal verification of inference algorithms using denotational semantics, as opposed to operational semantics used in some prior work (e.g. Hur et al. 2015, Borgstr√∂m et al. 2016). This allows modular, compositional reasoning.

- Provides semantic abstractions (representations, transformations, transformers) tailored towards inference algorithms. This differs from more general semantics for probabilistic programs (e.g. Ramsey and Pfeffer 2002, Borgs et al. 2014).

- Handles advanced inference algorithms like sequential Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo by combining semantic analysis of components. In contrast, most prior semantic treatments focus on simpler inference techniques. 

- Develops novel mathematical tools like quasi-Borel spaces to support higher-order functions and continuous distributions, overcoming limitations of traditional measure theory.

- Shows how to construct complex inference algorithms from basic building blocks that come with semantic validity proofs. Other work on modular inference (e.g. Wingate et al. 2011, Zinkov and Shan 2017) does not provide the same semantic guarantees.

- Emphasizes connection to traditional measure theory proofs using synthetic measure theory. Provides new results like generalized Metropolis-Hastings-Green theorem.

So in summary, this paper establishes a new denotational semantics foundation tailored to modular verification of sophisticated Bayesian inference algorithms, overcoming limitations of previous semantic and modular approaches. The technical development of quasi-Borel spaces is also novel and important.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several potential directions for future research:

1. Developing convergence guarantees for the inference algorithms. The current purely measure-theoretic approach does not provide convergence rates or error bounds after a certain number of inference steps. 

2. Extending the framework to algorithms that rely on derivatives of density functions, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or variational inference. This would likely require developing a theory of differentiation over quasi-Borel spaces.

3. Applying the framework to probabilistic programming languages that allow users to select or compose inference algorithms, such as Venture and Pyro. The semantics developed in the paper may help overcome difficulties in reasoning about such programs.

4. Developing an indexed or effect-annotated version of inference representations and transformers. This could enable selectively applying certain algorithms like HMC only to parts of a program with differentiable densities. 

5. Connecting the denotational semantics to program analysis techniques like instrumentation, for example expressing an inference algorithm as an instrumented semantics.

6. Practical convergence guarantees taking computational complexity into account, not just statistical complexity.

7. Applications to Nested Markov chain Monte Carlo, a technique for improving mixing and convergence.

8. Extensions to handle continuous-time stochastic processes and stochastic differential equations.

In summary, the main suggested directions are adding convergence analysis, supporting more algorithms, connecting to program analysis, handling complexity, and extending to new types of probabilistic models. The paper lays a solid semantic foundation that could enable progress in these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a semantic framework for specifying and verifying Bayesian inference algorithms used in probabilistic programming languages. It uses a core calculus to define semantic structures like the mass function monad and inference representations. These are used to decompose complex inference algorithms like sequential Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo into smaller reusable components. Each component comes with a semantic validity criterion based on preserving the meaning or distribution. The framework uses quasi-Borel spaces to support both higher order functions and continuous distributions, overcoming limitations of traditional measurable spaces. A key result is a quasi-Borel version of the Metropolis-Hastings-Green theorem for verifying Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Overall, the paper provides a new denotational approach for modular reasoning about correctness of inference algorithms in higher-order probabilistic programs with continuous distributions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a semantic framework for specifying and verifying Bayesian inference algorithms for probabilistic programming languages. Probabilistic programming languages allow expressing sophisticated statistical models and performing inference on them, but designing correct inference algorithms is challenging. The authors develop a modular semantic account based on monads, denotational semantics, and higher-order functions. They introduce the key abstractions of inference representations, which capture intermediate representations of probabilistic programs, and inference transformations between them which preserve the represented distribution. Complex inference algorithms can be constructed by composing such representations and transformations. 

A technical challenge is dealing with continuous distributions and higher-order functions, since the usual measurable space structure does not support both simultaneously. The authors overcome this using quasi-Borel spaces, which allow integrating over function spaces. They demonstrate their framework by providing semantic specifications for common inference algorithms like sequential Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo, decomposing them into simpler representations and transformations. Overall, this provides a rigorous foundation for specifying and verifying probabilistic programming systems in a modular way.
