# [FAST: Factorizable Attention for Speeding up Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers have quadratic computational and memory complexity in the number of tokens N, limiting their scalability. This is due to the softmax-based attention mechanism used. 
- Prior attempts at more efficient attention mechanisms have issues with reduced expressiveness, localization, or separability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes FAST, a novel attention metric based on a factorizable form inspired by the fast multipole method. 
- FAST attention reduces the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) without compromising accuracy or sparsifying the attention matrix.
- It uses a polynomial similarity metric instead of exponential, but shows similarly robust properties.
- The computations are simple and support automatic differentiation.

Main Contributions:
- FAST attention mechanism with linear complexity in both computation and memory.
- Maintains full representation of attention matrix with all-to-all token relationships.
- Shows strong performance across tasks compared to softmax attention.
- Can be seamlessly integrated into any transformer architecture.
- Enables transformers for long sequence tasks not viable before due to quadratic complexity limitations.
- Analyzes properties of FAST attention - visualizations, scaling, gradients, expressiveness.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel form of attention that scales linearly while maintaining the capabilities of standard softmax attention. This makes transformers viable for much longer sequences and data modalities previously infeasible. Experiments verify the efficiency, accuracy and expressiveness across diverse tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FAST, a novel attention mechanism for transformers that reduces the computational and memory complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of tokens, while maintaining comparable expressivity to softmax attention.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing FAST, a novel algorithm that achieves linear computational and memory complexity for calculating an attention-based score in transformers without compromising accuracy or sparsifying the attention matrix. Specifically, FAST is based on a new class of attention metrics, called Fastmax, which are factorizable to achieve linear complexity. The paper shows that FAST scales linearly in the number of tokens, has bounded and stable gradients, produces reasonable attention maps, and achieves competitive performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark compared to the quadratic softmax attention. The key novelty is developing an attention metric that is as expressive as softmax attention while being decomposable for efficiency.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions custom gradients can potentially reduce the memory complexity. Can you elaborate on how the custom gradients would be derived and implemented? What are the tradeoffs with using automatic differentiation?

2. You note the similarity in attention structure between softmax and fastmax when visualizing the attention maps. Can you hypothesize why fastmax, despite being a very different formulation, seems to learn similar inductive biases? 

3. The paper argues fastmax establishes a firm upper bound on the gradient to ensure stability. Can you walk through the mathematical derivation of this upper bound? How does this compare to other subquadratic methods?

4. How exactly is the dropout implemented in fastmax since the full attention matrix isn't explicitly calculated? What are the tradeoffs of the different dropout schemes analyzed in Figure 3?

5. The computational complexity contains terms with $H$, the number of heads. Can you explain how increasing heads reduces computational cost? What are the downsides? 

6. Could fastmax be extended to the Performer or Linformer architectures that also utilize low-rank structure? What would be the limitations?

7. The paper benchmarks wall-clock time against softmax but doesn't compare optimization performance. Could fastmax possibly converge slower? How would you test this?

8. How valid is the Long Range Arena benchmark for evaluating expressivity, given recent results showing poor correlation to language modeling tasks? What additional experiments would better demonstrate fastmax capabilities?

9. The similarity function uses a low-order polynomial expansion inspired by the Taylor series of the exponential. Can you explain why the exponential was chosen over other similarity metrics?

10. The paper focuses on self-attention transformers, but fastmax could likely be applied to cross-attention. What challenges do you anticipate in extending it to decoder-encoder attention?
