# [Vertical Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Symbolic regression, which aims to find symbolic expressions from data, is a key task in AI-driven scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods mostly follow a "horizontal" path, trying to directly search for the best expression in the full hypothesis space with all variables. This full hypothesis space is exponentially large, making the task very challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Vertical Symbolic Regression" (VSR) to expedite symbolic regression when learning expressions with many variables. 
- VSR initially holds all variables constant except one, and searches for simple symbolic expressions mapping the single free variable to output. This is much easier than searching in the full space.
- It then gradually adds more free variables, expanding the expressions by fitting new data where additional variables are allowed to vary. The search spaces in the initial steps are exponentially smaller.
- At each step, VSR uses control variable experiments, where a subset of variables are held constant. From such experiments, VSR determines whether a constant represents a standalone constant or a summary of a sub-expression involving controlled variables. This allows controlled expansion towards the final expression.
- VSR can use any symbolic regressor at each step. The paper implements it with Genetic Programming (VSR-GP) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (VSR-MCTS).

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the idea of vertical symbolic regression through controlled expansion based on control variable experiments. This can reduce exponential search spaces to polynomial. 
- Implements VSR-GP and VSR-MCTS algorithms and shows superior performance over various state-of-the-art baselines on multiple symbolic regression benchmarks.
- Demonstrates VSR's ability to handle expressions with more variables than existing methods.
- Provides theoretical analysis to show exponential versus polynomial search space sizes for VSR versus horizontal search.
- Shows benefits of VSR including lower training time, memory, and higher rate of recovering ground truth expressions.

In summary, the paper proposes a vertical discovery path to efficiently search for symbolic expressions, demonstrating superior scalability over horizontal search methods. The integration of controlled experiments is key to the success of VSR.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Vertical Symbolic Regression method that incrementally builds symbolic expressions by first modeling a subset of variables under controlled experiments, then iteratively expanding the expressions by incorporating more variables, in order to reduce the combinatorial search space and accelerate the discovery of complex multi-variable expressions from data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes Vertical Symbolic Regression (VSR) for symbolic regression tasks with many independent variables. VSR starts from learning equations mapping a subset of independent variables in reduced hypothesis spaces through a customized set of control variable experiments. Then it iteratively expands such equations to the full hypothesis space.

2. It shows theoretically that VSR can bring an exponential reduction in the search spaces when learning a class of expressions, compared to horizontal symbolic regression methods that search the full hypothesis space directly.

3. It implements two variants of the proposed VSR framework - VSR using Genetic Programming (VSR-GP) and VSR using Monte Carlo Tree Search (VSR-MCTS). It shows empirically that VSR-GP and VSR-MCTS outperform several state-of-the-art approaches on symbolic regression tasks.

4. It demonstrates that VSR finds expressions with the smallest median Normalized Mean-Square Errors among all compared methods on several benchmark datasets, is robust to noise, and recovers the ground-truth expressions at a higher rate compared to baselines.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing Vertical Symbolic Regression to effectively handle symbolic regression tasks with many variables by searching reduced hypothesis spaces first and then expanding the search space. This is shown both theoretically and empirically to outperform existing horizontal symbolic regression methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Vertical symbolic regression (VSR)
- Control variable experiments
- Reduced-form equations
- Genetic programming (GP)
- Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)
- Symbolic regression
- Scientific discovery
- Multi-variable equations
- Hypothesis space reduction
- Vertical vs horizontal discovery paths

The main ideas proposed in the paper are using control variable experiments and vertical discovery paths to incrementally build up complex multi-variable symbolic expressions. This is contrasted with horizontal discovery paths that try to directly find expressions with all variables in the full hypothesis space. Key methods leveraged are genetic programming (VSR-GP) and Monte Carlo tree search (VSR-MCTS). Theoretical and empirical results show the potential of VSR to reduce exponential search spaces down to polynomial sizes for certain classes of expressions. Overall, the key theme is using vertical AI-driven scientific discovery to tackle challenging symbolic regression problems involving many variables.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the vertical symbolic regression (VSR) method reduce the exponential search space into a polynomial search space when fitting symbolic expressions? What class of expressions does this apply to?

2. What is the key intuition behind using control variable experiments in the VSR framework? How do they help in incrementally building more complex expressions?

7. What customizations are done in the Genetic Programming and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms to suit them to the VSR framework requirements?

8. How sensitive is the performance of VSR to factors like number of variables, choice of operators, noise levels, etc.? What trends can be observed?  

9. What are some potential ways the incremental expansion idea of VSR could be integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms like neural-based methods?

10. What modifications would be needed to apply the VSR approach to discovering governing equations in domains like physics, chemistry and biology?
