# [Vertical Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Symbolic regression, which aims to find symbolic expressions from data, is a key task in AI-driven scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods mostly follow a "horizontal" path, trying to directly search for the best expression in the full hypothesis space with all variables. This full hypothesis space is exponentially large, making the task very challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Vertical Symbolic Regression" (VSR) to expedite symbolic regression when learning expressions with many variables. 
- VSR initially holds all variables constant except one, and searches for simple symbolic expressions mapping the single free variable to output. This is much easier than searching in the full space.
- It then gradually adds more free variables, expanding the expressions by fitting new data where additional variables are allowed to vary. The search spaces in the initial steps are exponentially smaller.
- At each step, VSR uses control variable experiments, where a subset of variables are held constant. From such experiments, VSR determines whether a constant represents a standalone constant or a summary of a sub-expression involving controlled variables. This allows controlled expansion towards the final expression.
- VSR can use any symbolic regressor at each step. The paper implements it with Genetic Programming (VSR-GP) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (VSR-MCTS).

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the idea of vertical symbolic regression through controlled expansion based on control variable experiments. This can reduce exponential search spaces to polynomial. 
- Implements VSR-GP and VSR-MCTS algorithms and shows superior performance over various state-of-the-art baselines on multiple symbolic regression benchmarks.
- Demonstrates VSR's ability to handle expressions with more variables than existing methods.
- Provides theoretical analysis to show exponential versus polynomial search space sizes for VSR versus horizontal search.
- Shows benefits of VSR including lower training time, memory, and higher rate of recovering ground truth expressions.

In summary, the paper proposes a vertical discovery path to efficiently search for symbolic expressions, demonstrating superior scalability over horizontal search methods. The integration of controlled experiments is key to the success of VSR.
