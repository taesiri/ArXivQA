# [SAGA: Spectral Adversarial Geometric Attack on 3D Meshes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13775)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main research question this paper addresses is how to generate effective geometric adversarial attacks on 3D mesh autoencoders. Specifically, it proposes a novel framework called SAGA (Spectral Adversarial Geometric Attack) for creating adversarial mesh inputs that fool autoencoders into reconstructing different target geometries. The key hypotheses are:1. Adversarial attacks can move beyond just fooling classifiers (semantic attacks) and can also target the geometry reconstruction capabilities of autoencoders.2. Perturbing meshes in the spectral domain based on their Laplacian eigendecomposition allows controlling the global geometry while limiting visible distortions. 3. Optimizing perturbations using a reconstruction loss to match a target shape and mesh-based regularizations can create effective adversarial examples.4. The adversarial reconstructions will generalize and transfer to other unseen autoencoders.So in summary, the central research focus is developing a spectral mesh perturbation method that generates geometrically adversarial inputs to fool autoencoders, while also conducting experiments to evaluate the attack effectiveness and transferability.
