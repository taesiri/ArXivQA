# [Combined Task and Motion Planning Via Sketch Decompositions (Extended   Version with Supplementary Material)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16277)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Combined task and motion planning (TAMP) integrates high-level symbolic task planning with lower-level motion planning. Effectively combining these two levels of planning is challenging.
- Existing approaches either (1) check symbolic plans for feasibility using a motion planner or (2) sample feasible configurations upfront to generate symbolic plans. These approaches have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel interleaved approach to TAMP using sketches.
- Sketches are rules over state features that decompose problems into simpler subproblems. Sketches exploit domain structure.
- The proposed sketch for TAMP tasks has a width of 1, decomposing problems into subproblems solvable greedily with linear search. 
- Sampling is done locally per subproblem instead of globally. When a subplan fails due to geometry, search resumes from that subproblem.  

Main Contributions:
- First use of sketches for TAMP to exploit problem structure.
- Sketch of width 1 developed for pick-and-place problems under assumptions.
- Local subproblem sampling enables tighter integration of symbolic and geometric reasoning.
- Failure isolation and recovery within subproblems, avoiding full restarts.
- Evaluated on TAMP benchmarks, outperforming prior tableau and sampling based methods.
- Probabilistically complete and near optimal performance demonstrated empirically.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel sketch-guided approach for TAMP that decomposes problems into simple subproblems solved with efficient linear search. Key innovations are local sampling per subproblem and subproblem-focused failure recovery. Experiments validate the approach, showing state-of-the-art performance on standard TAMP benchmarks.
