# [Semantic Scene Completion with Cleaner Self](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09977)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is how to handle the inherent noise in depth values when predicting semantic 3D scene completion from an RGB image and depth input. The depth noise leads to two main problems:

1) Incomplete surface reconstruction due to zero noise where the depth sensor cannot estimate depth in some regions. This leads to incomplete 3D predictions. 

2) Confused semantic labels due to delta noise where the depth value deviates from the ground truth. This results in voxels getting wrong semantic labels.

The main hypothesis is that training with ground truth noise-free depth values can provide cleaner knowledge that can be transferred to a model that takes real noisy depth as input at test time. The key research questions are:

- Can a teacher model trained on perfect depth provide useful knowledge to guide a student model trained on noisy depth to handle the two noise issues?

- What distillation strategies are most effective for transferring the cleaner knowledge - feature-based, logit-based, or both?

- Does this knowledge transfer lead to improved scene completion and semantic scene completion compared to models trained only on noisy depth data?

So in summary, the core research focus is on leveraging knowledge distillation to mitigate the effects of inherent depth noise during training for improving semantic 3D scene completion at test time when only noisy depth is available.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel Cleaner Self (CleanerS) framework for Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) that can mitigate the negative effects of noisy depth values during training. 

2. It identifies two common types of noise in depth values - zero noise and delta noise - and analyzes their impacts on SSC performance.

3. It trains a teacher network on noise-free depth values rendered from 3D voxel ground truth to learn "cleaner" knowledge. This is then transferred to a student network with noisy depth values via knowledge distillation.

4. Specifically, it uses feature-based and logit-based distillation strategies to transfer occupancy and semantic knowledge from the teacher to student network. 

5. Extensive experiments show the proposed CleanerS framework improves performance over noisy counterparts by 3.1% in scene completion IoU and 2.2% in SSC mIoU.

6. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on the challenging NYU dataset for SSC using noisy depth values as input.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel training framework called CleanerS that can learn from noise-free data to improve a model that takes noisy data as input for the SSC task. This is done through specific feature and logit based knowledge distillation strategies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a Cleaner Self framework for Semantic Scene Completion that uses knowledge distillation from a teacher network trained on noise-free data to help improve a student network trained on noisy data, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NYU dataset without needing ground truth at inference time.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new approach for semantic scene completion (SSC) that addresses key limitations of prior work, particularly in handling noise in the input depth data. Here is a high-level comparison to related work:

- Most prior SSC methods take noisy depth data as input, which leads to problems like incomplete predictions and confused semantics. This paper is the first to focus on mitigating the negative effects of noisy depth inputs.

- Some recent works use ground truth depth data for training SSC models. However, they still require clean depth at test time, which is impractical. This paper transfers knowledge from clean data to the noisy pipeline only during training. 

- For handling noise, common approaches are data denoising or learning robust features. This paper proposes a novel "cleaner self" framework of distilling knowledge from a teacher (trained on clean data) to student (trained on noisy data).

- State-of-the-art SSC methods are based on TSDF, points, or RGB-D fusion. This paper also adopts a hybrid approach of RGB image + TSDF volumes, but contributes new distillation objectives tailored for SSC.

- Both feature-level and output-level distillation are explored, finding global semantic distillation more effective than local voxel distillation due to input differences.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the challenging NYU dataset. The framework improves noisy counterparts, achieving gains of 3.1% in scene completion and 2.2% in semantic completion.

In summary, this paper makes key contributions in analyzing and addressing the impact of depth noise on SSC, via a novel knowledge distillation approach that does not require ground truth depth at test time. The gains over prior art validate it as a new state-of-the-art technique.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigating other types of noises and artifacts in depth data beyond zero noise and delta noise. The authors primarily focused on mitigating these two main types of noise, but there may be other imperfections in real-world depth data that could benefit from similar noise-robust training techniques.

- Exploring additional knowledge distillation strategies beyond feature and logit distillation. The authors propose feature and logit distillation to transfer knowledge from the teacher to student network, but other distillation techniques like attention map or relation distillation could provide complementary benefits.

- Applying the CleanerS framework to other 3D vision tasks beyond semantic scene completion. The idea of training a teacher model on perfect ground truth data to supervise a student model on noisy data could be beneficial for other tasks like 3D object detection, 3D semantic segmentation, etc.

- Developing more advanced teacher-student training schemes that allow the student to actually surpass the teacher over time, rather than just match its performance. This could lead to models that exceed the capabilities of training only on ground truth data.

- Testing the approach on more diverse and challenging real-world datasets. The authors demonstrate results on NYU, but applying CleanerS to messy natural environments could reveal new challenges.

- Exploring semi-supervised or self-supervised training schemes that rely less on ground truth 3D labels. Obtaining full 3D ground truth for training is expensive, so reducing this dependence could increase applicability.

Overall, the core idea of training teacher and student networks for noise-robust 3D vision seems promising, and there are many interesting directions to take it in future work. The results on semantic scene completion provide a solid proof-of-concept for the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Cleaner Self (CleanerS) framework to handle noisy depth values for the task of Semantic Scene Completion (SSC). SSC transforms a single RGB-D image into a complete 3D voxel representation with semantic labels. Noisy depth values cause two main issues: incomplete visible surfaces leading to incomplete predictions, and shifted visible surfaces leading to confused semantic labels. CleanerS consists of a teacher network trained on perfect depth values rendered from ground truth voxels, and a student network trained on real noisy depth values. During training, the teacher provides intermediate supervision to the student via knowledge distillation, transferring its "cleaner" knowledge. Specifically, the teacher's 3D occupancy features supervise the student's features to address incomplete surfaces, and the teacher's semantic relations supervise the student's relations to address confused semantics. Experiments show CleanerS improves results on the NYU dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance, without needing ground truth depth at test time.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Cleaner Self (CleanerS) framework for Semantic Scene Completion (SSC). SSC transforms a single image into a complete 3D voxel representation with semantic labels. However, most methods rely on noisy depth data, leading to incomplete predictions and confused semantics. The key insight is to train one "teacher" model on perfect depth data rendered from ground truth voxels. This teacher provides intermediate supervision to a "student" model trained on real noisy depth data. 

Specifically, CleanerS contains a teacher and student network with identical architectures. The teacher takes noise-free depth while the student takes noisy depth as input. Through feature-based and logit-based knowledge distillation, the teacher guides the student to focus on reconstructing the visible surface and imagining occluded regions. The student learns to complete scenes despite imperfect perception. Experiments show CleanerS improves noisy counterparts and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the NYU dataset. The framework transfers knowledge from perfect depth at train time to boost performance on noisy depth at test time.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Cleaner Self (CleanerS) framework for Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) that aims to mitigate the negative effects of noisy depth input. The framework consists of a teacher network trained on ground truth noise-free depth data, and a student network trained on noisy depth data. To transfer clean knowledge to the student, feature-based and logit-based knowledge distillation is applied. Specifically, the noisy student's 3D occupancy feature is supervised by the cleaner teacher's feature to address incomplete predictions. The student's semantic relations are also supervised by the teacher's relations to address confused semantic labels. This allows the student network to learn from the teacher's clean knowledge during training. Only the student network is used during inference with noisy depth data. Experiments show the proposed method improves results over baselines and achieves state-of-the-art on the NYU dataset.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to handle noise in the depth data for semantic scene completion (SSC). SSC involves predicting full 3D semantic voxel representations from limited 2D RGB-D views. A key challenge is that the depth data from sensors like Kinect contains two main types of noise:

1) Zero noise - When the depth sensor fails to estimate depth in some regions, it just sets the depth to zero. This leads to incomplete surface representations and volumetric predictions. 

2) Delta noise - The depth values have inherent inaccuracies and deviations from ground truth. This causes errors in mapping 2D pixels to 3D positions and results in confused semantic labels in the final voxel predictions.

Existing SSC methods suffer from these noise issues. The main contribution of this paper is a framework called CleanerS that uses knowledge distillation to mitigate the effects of noisy depth during training. It trains one "teacher" model on clean ground truth depth data. This teacher provides supervision to guide a "student" model that trains on the noisy sensor depth data. Specifically, it uses feature-based and logit-based distillation losses to transfer knowledge about occupancy features and semantic relations from the teacher to the student.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel training framework to handle depth noise in SSC by transferring knowledge from a model trained on clean data to guide one trained on noisy data. Experiments show it improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art on the NYU dataset.

- Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF): A common representation for the visible surface extracted from the depth image. 

- Zero noise: Errors in the depth image where depth values are incorrectly set to zero, causing incomplete surface reconstruction.

- Delta noise: Deviations in the measured depth values compared to ground truth, causing errors in surface localization and semantics.

In summary, the key focus is on addressing two common depth noise types in SSC using knowledge distillation techniques to transfer knowledge from a teacher network trained on clean data. This allows improved performance on real noisy data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Cleaner Self (CleanerS) framework that consists of a teacher network and a student network. What is the motivation behind using this teacher-student setup? How does it help mitigate the impact of noisy depth values?

2. The teacher network is trained on noise-free depth values rendered from 3D voxel ground truth, while the student network is trained on noisy depth values. Why is the knowledge from the teacher considered "cleaner"? What specifically makes it less prone to noise?

3. The paper mentions using both feature-based and logit-based knowledge distillation (KD) strategies. Can you explain the difference between these two KD approaches? What are the advantages of using both?

4. In the feature-based KD, the TSDF features from the teacher and student networks are matched using an MSE loss. Why are the TSDF features chosen for this rather than other features? What properties of the TSDF features make this beneficial?

5. The logit-based KD uses two complementary strategies - semantic-centered distillation (KD-SC) and semantic affinity distillation (KD-SA). How do these two strategies work? What types of knowledge do they aim to transfer? 

6. The paper compares the proposed logit-based KD with a more straightforward voxel-wise logit distillation. Why is the voxel-wise distillation less effective? What inherent challenges make it harder to match voxels from the teacher and student?

7. The student network takes noisy TSDF as input, while the teacher takes clean TSDF-CAD. How big is the gap between outputs of the teacher and student due to this input difference? Does this make distillation harder?

8. The paper reports improved scene completion and semantic scene completion results on the NYU dataset. Can you analyze these results and summarize the key benefits obtained from the proposed CleanerS framework?

9. The method relies on having voxel ground truth to render clean TSDF-CAD for the teacher network. How amenable would this be to scale up to larger, more diverse scene completion datasets? What are the challenges?

10. The overall CleanerS framework seems quite generic. Do you think a similar idea could be applied to other vision tasks that suffer from inherent sensor noise issues? What would need to be adapted?
