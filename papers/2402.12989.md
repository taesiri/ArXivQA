# [Tactile Perception in Upper Limb Prostheses: Mechanical   Characterization, Human Experiments, and Computational Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12989)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is limited research on characterizing the natural transmission of tactile signals through prosthetic devices and the implications for prosthetic design. 
- It is unknown how the type of prosthetic hand affects user perception of tactile cues.
- Softer, more articulated prosthetic hands likely dampen vibration transmission compared to simpler, rigid hands, but the impact on user perception is unclear.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:
- Assessed a prosthetic user's ability to discriminate finger contacts based on vibrations transmitted through 4 prosthetic hands with distinct mechanics.
- Conducted mechanical vibration tests on the prostheses by impacting each fingertip and measuring socket-level vibrations. 
- Correlated human perceptual performance with prosthesis vibration transmission characteristics.
- Trained LSTM networks on socket vibration signals to classify contacted finger.

Key Findings:
- User could discriminate contacted finger above chance level for all prostheses, with higher accuracy for more rigid, less articulated hands.
- Softer, articulated hands dampened vibration transmission compared to rigid hands.
- LSTM networks achieved higher finger discrimination accuracy than human subject, even for softer hands, showing vibration signals contain necessary information.  

Main Conclusions:
- Prosthesis mechanics affect user tactile perception through changes in vibration transmission.
- Enhancing vibration transmission in softer hands could improve perception.
- Vibration signals and LSTM networks show promise for integrating tactile feedback in prostheses.

So in summary, the key innovation is showing that a prosthetic user has natural tactile perception abilities that depend on prosthesis mechanics, and that artificial enhancement of transmission with ML techniques could enable intuitive tactile feedback.
