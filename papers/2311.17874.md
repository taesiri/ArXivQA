# [FisherRF: Active View Selection and Uncertainty Quantification for   Radiance Fields using Fisher Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17874)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called FisherRF for active view selection and uncertainty quantification in neural radiance fields. The key idea is to leverage Fisher information, which represents the expectation of observation information, to quantify the observed information within radiance field models. This allows efficiently selecting the next best views that maximize information gain without needing ground truth data. Specifically, the method computes Hessian matrices of the negative log-likelihood loss function used to optimize radiance fields, which provide information about the flatness of the loss surface. Flatter minima indicate lower information so views can be chosen to maximize curvature. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate superior performance over prior methods for next best view selection. Additionally, pixel-wise uncertainty maps are produced by aggregating Fisher information along rays to enable identifying low-confidence regions. The method's general applicability and state-of-the-art quantitative results highlight its potential to advance radiance field tasks limited by viewpoints. Key advantages include efficiency from exploiting sparsity and independence between rays, avoidance of architectural constraints, and the linkage between information gain and loss curvature.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using Fisher information to quantify the uncertainty in radiance fields. How does Fisher information provide an advantage over other uncertainty quantification methods like Bayesian neural networks or ensemble approaches? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper shows impressive results on active view selection for novel view synthesis. Could the method also be applied to other problems like 3D reconstruction or semantic/instance segmentation to actively select views? What modifications would be needed?

3. The paper uses a greedy batch selection algorithm to pick multiple views at once. Could more sophisticated Bayesian optimization approaches like expected improvement select better batches? How would the computational complexity compare?

4. For Fisher information calculation, the paper uses a diagonal plus log-prior approximation of the Hessian. What is the impact of this approximation? Could using the full Hessian or more advanced Hessian approximation methods improve performance further?

5. The paper evaluates performance on synthetic and real datasets with limited viewpoints. How would the approach perform on large-scale, dynamic scenes with many viewpoints? Are there scalability challenges?

6. The visualization of pixel-wise uncertainty is an interesting direction opened up by this work. What other applications could leverage these pixel uncertainties, like novel view synthesis, 3D reconstruction, or segmentation?

7. Could the quantification of information gain from new views enable lifelong or continual learning of radiance fields over time as new data is captured? 

8. How sensitive is the performance of the method to hyperparameters like the log-prior regularization factor? Is additional tuning or learning of hyperparameters needed for new scenes?

9. For real-world deployment, selecting views can require physically moving a camera or capturing new images. How feasible and practical is the 70fps computation speed for those scenarios?

10. The method shows strong performance, but the complexity could limit real-time application. Are there opportunities to improve computational performance through Quantization, distillation, pruning, or efficient codings of the Fisher matrices?
