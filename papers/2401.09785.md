# [Instant Answering in E-Commerce Buyer-Seller Messaging using   Message-to-Question Reformulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09785)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
In e-commerce, customers often need more detailed product information than what's provided in listings to make purchase decisions. They directly contact sellers with lengthy, email-style messages seeking additional details. However, manually responding to these messages is time/cost intensive for sellers, causing high wait times of hours to days before buyers receive responses. This negatively impacts customer experience and delays purchase decisions.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors develop an AI system called Message-to-Question (M2Q) to instantly answer buyer's messages to sellers using an existing Question Answering (QA) system. However, the verbose, multi-intent nature of buyer messages poses a challenge for QA systems designed for simple questions. 

M2Q employs sequence-to-sequence models to reformulate messages into concise, standalone questions capturing the buyer's main intent. These are then fed to a federated QA pipeline drawing answers from product catalogs, manuals etc. If unsatisfied, buyers can still contact sellers.

Key Contributions:

- Propose a novel approach to enable instant QA for buyer-seller messages via reformulation
- Design an effective sequence-to-sequence model optimized for message-to-question reformulation
- Demonstrate significant improvements in QA performance over baselines by evaluating on a human-annotated dataset
- Show increased purchase rates and decreased seller messages after launching system on a live e-commerce platform

The proposed M2Q approach effectively bridges the gap between buyer messages and QA systems. By distilling multi-intent messages down to clear, answerable questions, it enables the QA pipeline to respond instantly without seller involvement. This improves customer experience and reduces costs for sellers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called Message-to-Question (M2Q) that reformulates lengthy buyer messages in e-commerce into concise, answerable questions for a QA system to provide instant responses, improving the shopping experience and reducing seller overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an approach called "Message-to-Question" (M2Q) for automatically answering messages sent from buyers to sellers in e-commerce platforms. Specifically:

- M2Q reformulates lengthy buyer messages into concise, salient questions that are optimized for understanding and response by a federated question answering (QA) system. This allows providing instant answers to buyers without needing manual response from sellers.

- Offline experiments show M2Q increases question understanding by 755% and answering rate by 1,746% compared to baselines when using the QA system.

- Live deployment demonstrates M2Q reduces buyer-to-seller messages by up to 276%, likely due to user satisfaction with the instant answers. It also increases purchase rates by 57.14% compared to a control group without instant answers.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating an approach to provide instant answers to buyer messages in e-commerce platforms, which improves both buyer experience and reduces seller overhead.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Buyer-seller messaging (BSM)
- Question answering (QA) 
- Message reformulation
- Sequence-to-sequence models
- Message-to-Question (M2Q)
- Federated QA system
- Instant answering
- E-commerce
- Purchase metrics
- Message intent extraction
- Text summarization

The paper focuses on automating buyer inquiries to sellers in e-commerce using a domain-specific federated QA system. The key challenge it addresses is adapting QA systems designed for simple questions to handle lengthy, detailed customer queries. The proposed M2Q approach reformulates buyer messages into more succinct, answerable questions to improve the QA system's understanding and answering capabilities. The paper demonstrates gains in metrics like purchase rate and successful answer rate from real-world deployment. So the key terms revolve around applying QA and text reformulation to improve e-commerce conversations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What motivated the authors to develop the Message-to-Question (M2Q) approach for reformulating buyer messages into answerable questions? What specific problems or limitations were they trying to address?

2. How does M2Q differ from previous approaches that aimed to match buyer inquiries to existing product information or QA pairs? What novel capabilities does it introduce? 

3. Explain the two components of the M2Q approach - generative and extractive reformulation. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method? When is one preferred over the other?

4. What sequence-to-sequence models did the authors experiment with as the basis for the generative reformulation component? Why did they ultimately select T5 and Flan-T5 as the best approaches? 

5. The paper mentions combining the generative and extractive methods into a "hybrid" approach. Can you explain the intuition behind this and why it improved performance over either individual method?

6. What specific guidelines and quality control processes were used in creating the human-annotated dataset used to train and evaluate M2Q? Why were these important?

7. Besides the offline experiments, the paper also conducted an online evaluation with real e-commerce users. Can you summarize the relative improvements found for key metrics like Purchase Rate and Successful Answer Rate?

8. What conclusions did the authors draw about the impact of providing instant answers on both buyer experience/satisfaction and reducing seller workload? Were these expected or surprising outcomes? 

9. How might the performance of M2Q be further improved in future work? What are limitations of the current approach that still need to be addressed?  

10. Do you think the Message-to-Question technique could be applied successfully to other domains like customer support conversations? Why or why not?
