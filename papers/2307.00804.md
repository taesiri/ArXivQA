# [SketchMetaFace: A Learning-based Sketching Interface for High-fidelity   3D Character Face Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00804)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an easy-to-use sketching system that allows amateur users to create high-fidelity 3D character face models with only 2D freehand sketches. The key challenges the authors aim to tackle are:- Accuracy - How to assist users in conveying their ideas accurately through sketches. The authors adopt curvature-aware strokes to address this.- Usability - How to reduce the cognitive load when using curvature-aware strokes and make the system intuitive for amateurs. The authors propose a coarse-to-fine interface, stroke suggestions, and keeping interactions 2D. - High-fidelity modeling - How to map 2D sketches to detailed 3D models effectively. The authors propose a novel Implicit and Depth Guided Mesh Modeling (IDGMM) algorithm that fuses mesh, implicit and depth representations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by carefully designing the user interface to be intuitive yet expressive, and developing a learning-based backend algorithm that combines the strengths of different 3D representations, it is possible to create an easy-to-use sketching system for amateurs to model high-fidelity 3D character faces. The paper aims to demonstrate this through both system design and experimental evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting SketchMetaFace, a novel sketching system that allows amateur users to easily create high-fidelity 3D character face models. The key aspects are:- A carefully designed user interface with a coarse-to-fine modeling scheme, curvature-aware strokes for crafting geometric details, and a data-driven stroke suggestion tool. This aims to make the system intuitive and easy-to-use for novices.- A new algorithm called Implicit and Depth Guided Mesh Modeling (IDGMM) that fuses mesh, implicit and depth representations. This allows generating detailed 3D shapes from 2D sketches efficiently and accurately. - Comprehensive evaluation of the system usability through user studies, which shows it enables amateurs to create diverse high-quality 3D faces more easily compared to prior systems.- Evaluation of the IDGMM algorithm through comparisons with other sketch-to-3D methods, ablations studies and perceptual studies. The results demonstrate IDGMM's superiority in accuracy, detail generation and efficiency.In summary, the main contribution is developing an end-to-end system with both user interface designs and technical innovations to make high-fidelity 3D face modeling from sketches accessible to novice users. Both qualitative results and quantitative experiments confirm the effectiveness of SketchMetaFace.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in sketch-based 3D modeling:- The paper presents a sketch-based modeling system focused specifically on creating detailed 3D faces and heads. Many other sketch-based modeling systems are more general and aim to create a wider variety of 3D shapes like furniture, vehicles, etc. - It utilizes a coarse-to-fine modeling approach, allowing users to start with a rough face shape before adding fine details. This follows similar "top-down" workflows in other sketch-based systems.- The use of curvature-aware strokes is unique, allowing control over bumps/dents in the surface. Most other systems use regular pen/pencil strokes. This gives more control over geometric details.- The learning-based backend uses a novel combination of implicit functions, depth maps, and mesh deformation. Many recent systems also use learning-based methods, but this specific technique seems unique.- It incorporates data-driven suggestions to assist novice users. Providing suggestions or recommendations based on data is an emerging trend in sketch-based modeling tools.- The interface focuses on 2D sketching with minimal 3D interactions. Some systems rely more heavily on 3D view manipulation or 3D curve/stroke input.- Evaluations indicate it is easier to use and produces higher quality 3D heads compared to existing tools like DeepSketch2Face and SimpModeling. User studies are important for demonstrating sketching interface improvements.So in summary, this paper advances sketch-based modeling specifically for detailed 3D heads, using a unique coarse-to-fine workflow, curvature-aware strokes, and a novel learning-based backend. Evaluations show improvements over previous systems.
