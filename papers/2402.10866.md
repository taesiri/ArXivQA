# [EcoRank: Budget-Constrained Text Re-ranking Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10866)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are very effective for text re-ranking tasks but using them can be expensive due to pricing based on number of tokens. 
- This expense escalates for re-ranking many passages as substantial text needs to be inputted, making the cost intractable for high query volumes.
- Existing works on using LLMs for re-ranking focus only on accuracy, not considering budget constraints. 

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate budget-constrained text re-ranking as an optimization problem to maximize performance within a given budget.
- Explore different prompt strategies like pointwise, pairwise and listwise methods tailored for re-ranking under budget constraints.
- Introduce EcoRank, a two-layer pipeline that jointly optimizes decisions on prompt strategies, LLM API choices, and budget allocation. 
- First layer re-ranks passages with pointwise relevance filtering using expensive but accurate LLM, removing irrelevant ones. 
- Remaining budget is then allocated in second layer to re-rank relevant passages using cheaper LLM and pairwise comparisons.

Main Contributions:
- First work addressing budget-aware modeling for text re-ranking using LLMs.
- Suite of budget-constrained methods for re-ranking using LLM APIs.
- EcoRank method outperforming other budget-aware baselines by 14% in accuracy, efficiently navigating spaces of prompt choices, LLM APIs and budget splits.
- Extensive evaluation of prompt designs and API choices on four datasets.

In summary, the paper tackles budget-aware optimization for utilizing expensive LLMs in text re-ranking via a novel two-stage EcoRank approach.
