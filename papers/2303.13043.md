# [Top-Down Visual Attention from Analysis by Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13043)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can a visual perception system achieve task-guided top-down attention through the framework of Analysis by Synthesis?

The key hypotheses are:

- Top-down visual attention arises naturally from optimizing a sparse reconstruction objective modulated by a high-level prior in an Analysis by Synthesis system. 

- A vision system that variationally approximates Analysis by Synthesis with a prior-modulated objective will be able to achieve controllable top-down attention.

In summary, the paper proposes that top-down attention can be achieved by incorporating a high-level prior into a visual analysis system based on the Analysis by Synthesis framework. The central hypothesis is that this will allow task-specific guidance of attention. The authors test this hypothesis by building a vision transformer model called AbSViT that approximates Analysis by Synthesis and demonstrate its controllable top-down attention capabilities.
