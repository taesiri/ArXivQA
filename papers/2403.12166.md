# [The Power of Few: Accelerating and Enhancing Data Reweighting with   Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses two key challenges in machine learning model training: (1) improving computational efficiency, and (2) maintaining or enhancing model accuracy. Specifically, it notes that while techniques like coreset selection and data reweighting have made progress, they each have limitations. Coreset selection can lose nuanced data diversity, while data reweighting incurs heavy computational costs. The paper thus sets out to develop an approach that balances efficiency and performance.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new method called Coreset Reweighting for ERM (CW-ERM) that integrates coreset selection and data reweighting. The key idea is to focus the computationally expensive reweighting step on a strategically selected coreset subset of the data. This enhanced coreset is then used to efficiently propagate updated weights back to the full dataset. 

The method has three main steps:
1) Coreset Selection: Select a representative coreset using median distance-based scoring after extracting features with a pre-trained model. This compresses the dataset.
2) Coreset Reweighting: Optimize sample weights for the coreset alone using MetaWeightNet, reducing computational load.
3) Weight Broadcasting: Propagate optimized coreset weights back to the full dataset via nearest neighbors.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new framework that combines coreset selection and data reweighting to balance efficiency and performance.

- Shows that less than 1% of the dataset can be sufficient for effective reweighting, dramatically increasing efficiency.

- Empirically validates the method on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

The summary highlights the key problem motivating the work, explains the main ideas of the proposed CW-ERM method, and states the major contributions substantiated through experiments. It covers the essential aspects to convey both the technical approach and its significance.
