# [Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07015)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we leverage the diffusion priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion for the task of blind super-resolution of real-world images, without having to train a new model from scratch?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) By fine-tuning only a lightweight time-aware encoder attached to a frozen pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, the generative priors can be preserved while adapting the model for super-resolution in an efficient manner. 2) The time-aware encoder can provide adaptive guidance to the diffusion model during sampling, with stronger guidance earlier in the process and weaker guidance later, to help maintain fidelity.3) A controllable feature wrapping module can allow trading off between fidelity and realism by residual tuning of the diffusion model's decoder features based on the encoder features.4) A progressive patch aggregation sampling strategy can enable handling arbitrary image resolutions beyond the fixed resolution of the pre-trained model.So in summary, the central research question is how to effectively adapt a pre-trained generative diffusion model for blind super-resolution of real-world images through targeted fine-tuning, while avoiding heavy re-training and preserving the useful generative priors.
