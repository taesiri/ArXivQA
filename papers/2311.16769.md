# [Equilibrium in the Computing Continuum through Active Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16769)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel framework for collaborative edge intelligence to ensure decentralized service level objective (SLO) fulfillment across the computing continuum. The framework allows systems to break down high-level requirements and enforce them at the components they concern, creating self-adaptive devices that ensure dynamic requirements themselves. It develops causal reasoning between environment factors and SLO fulfillment for each component using active inference, where devices continuously predict and evaluate observations to model processes. Resource-constrained devices unable to build this knowledge can exchange and combine causal models based on hardware characteristics, accelerating onboarding of unknown devices and simplifying horizontal scaling. To increase SLO scope, devices form intelligent clusters under fog node supervision that resolve violations by offloading computation among pertinent devices. Results showed edge devices required 16 rounds to ensure over 90% SLO compliance without prior knowledge, causal structures were empirically explainable to increase trust, variable distribution shifts were resolved through 9 rounds of retraining, and forming clusters increased SLO fulfillment from 1.03 to 1.54 by redistributing load after a network error. Overall, the framework erects hierarchical structures to fulfill intricate requirements across multiple tiers through decentralized intelligence.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework for collaborative edge intelligence that allows computing continuum systems to ensure service level objectives by creating self-adaptive edge devices through active inference, transferring knowledge between heterogeneous devices to accelerate model training, and optimizing cluster-wide quality of service and quality of experience by redistributing load according to environmental factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. An Active Inference (ACI)-based machine learning technique that allows Computing Continuum (CC) components to gradually identify causal relations between environmental metrics and service level objective (SLO) fulfillment. This allows components to evaluate SLOs in a decentralized way and update their beliefs according to new observations.

2. A method for transferring and combining machine learning models between heterogeneous edge devices to accelerate their convergence towards SLO-fulfilling configurations. This simplifies the onboarding of new and unknown device types in the edge layer. 

3. An offloading mechanism that redistributes load within an edge-fog cluster according to devices' capabilities to fulfill SLOs. This aims to improve cluster-wide quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) by counterbalancing environmental factors.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel framework for collaborative edge intelligence that ensures decentralized SLO fulfillment across different tiers of the CC system. The framework leverages concepts like active inference, transfer learning, and hierarchical control to achieve this.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework for collaborative edge intelligence to ensure decentralized Service Level Objective (SLO) fulfillment. Can you explain in detail the key components of this framework and how they work together to achieve this goal?

2. Active Inference (ACI) agents are a core part of the framework. Can you describe what ACI agents are, how they create Equilibrium-Oriented SLO-Compliance (EOSC) models, and how these models help ensure SLOs? 

3. The paper discusses using Markov Blankets (MBs) to reduce inference complexity. What are MBs, how do they achieve this complexity reduction, and what are the time complexity benefits quantified in the paper?

4. Transfer learning is leveraged to accelerate EOSC model training. Can you explain the model comparison and selection process, how models are combined/prepared, and what practical limitations were encountered?

5. The framework aims to handle shifts in variable distribution through continuous retraining. How does the paper evaluate this capability and what key observations were made regarding recovering from changes?

6. Bayesian Network Learning (BNL) involves both structure and parameter learning. What time complexity challenges did BNL introduce within the ACI cycle? How did the paper address or workaround them?

7. Explain the behavioral factors calculated by ACI agents and how they are used to evaluate and select system configurations. Also discuss how the paper analyzed and visualized these to interpret agent behavior.

8. At the cluster level, the paper proposes stream offloading based on a complementary EOSC-F model. Can you walk through how this model is constructed, the stream reassignment algorithm, and how network issues were resolved? 

9. Analyze and critique the prototype implementation, including key metrics captured, SLO formulation, device classification, and any practical limitations imposed. Do you see room for improvement?

10. The paper claims to achieve "equilibrium" through its approach. Do you feel this claim is justified? Why or why not? What enhancements could help better achieve computing continuum equilibrium?
