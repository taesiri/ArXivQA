# [KnowledgeVIS: Interpreting Language Models by Comparing   Fill-in-the-Blank Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04758)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
As large language models (LLMs) like BERT and GPT-3 gain popularity for text generation and summarization tasks, it has become challenging to interpret what factual and linguistic knowledge they have learned and why they work. Existing approaches rely on testing individual template sentences against a manually curated benchmark, which misses opportunities for researchers to intuitively probe models. There is a need for human-in-the-loop solutions that support comparing multiple prompt variations simultaneously.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents KnowledgeVIS, a visual analytics system for interpreting LLMs by comparing fill-in-the-blank prompts. It allows intuitive creation of prompt variations to test different relationships, surfaces insights by clustering predictions, and includes coordinated views to identify salient predictions and compare them across prompts. Specifically:

- An intuitive prompt interface structures input as a grid of templates and subjects for systematic variation.
- A novel taxonomy-based clustering groups predictions by semantic similarity to reveal patterns. 
- Interactive visualizations show prediction likelihoods, overlaps, and summaries at multiple levels to discover insights within and across prompts.

Key Capabilities and Contributions:

- Guides effective prompt engineering for eliciting factual, linguistic, and commonsense knowledge.
- Provides visual analytics workflow for qualitative analysis of multiple prompts.   
- Demonstrates revealing insights for domain-specific, bias, and knowledge probing tasks across models.
- Six NLP experts found new model capabilities and biases; wanted to use it for their own models.

In summary, KnowledgeVIS advances model interpretation through human-in-the-loop analysis of prompt variations, helping researchers inject intuition and expertise into the process. The coordinated views make comparisons more insightful than testing templates one at a time.
