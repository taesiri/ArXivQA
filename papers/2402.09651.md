# [Practitioners' Challenges and Perceptions of CI Build Failure   Predictions at Atlassian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09651)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Continuous integration (CI) build failures are a key challenge faced by developers at Atlassian, disrupting workflows and hampering productivity. 
- 17% of CI builds failed over 2021-2023, costing an average of 10 days wasted time per project to fix issues.
- There is a need to understand factors causing CI build failures and also gain insights into developers' perceptions of utilizing CI build prediction techniques.

Methodology:
- Analyzed 350,037 pull requests from 1,630 Atlassian projects to quantify 11 factors potentially influencing CI build failures. 
- Built a logistic regression model achieving AUC of 0.82 to identify significant factors.
- Surveyed 53 experienced Atlassian developers to capture perspectives on CI build failures and predictions.

Key Findings:
- Repository-related factors like previous build status and ratio of past failed builds have the strongest association with CI build failure likelihood.
- Developers find resolving CI build failures challenging and believe it impacts team productivity.
- Developers see value in CI build predictions to get proactive insights, though accuracy and over-reliance are concerns. 
- Developers agree with explanations based on percentage of changed files in past failures and number of changed files.

Main Contributions:
- Identified repository-level factors as most influential indicators of CI build failures, confirming applicability of prior research to industrial context.
- Highlighted productivity challenges posed by CI build failures from a developer perspective.
- Demonstrated developer interest in CI build prediction techniques to avoid failures proactively.
- Provided directions for enhancing CI processes via tailored integration of predictive insights.

The paper sheds light on the continued challenges of CI build failures in industry settings while also indicating developer receptiveness to advanced techniques like CI build prediction. It provides a foundation to guide further research and process improvements in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates continuous integration build failures at Atlassian through a quantitative analysis of factors influencing build outcomes and a qualitative survey of developers' perspectives, finding that repository metrics like prior build status strongly predict failures while developers see prediction tools as useful but requiring refinement to address concerns like over-reliance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1) It provides a quantitative analysis of factors associated with CI build failures using data from over 1,600 projects at Atlassian. The analysis found that factors related to the repository dimension, such as previous build history, have the strongest association with build failures.

2) It conducts a survey of 53 Atlassian developers to understand their perceptions of CI build failures and predictions. Key findings were that developers see resolving failures as challenging, failures can delay releases and reduce productivity, but they also provide learning opportunities. 

3) The survey explored developers' views on the usefulness of CI build predictions. It found developers see value in the predictions for gaining proactive insights and aiding decision-making, but they have concerns about accuracy, over-reliance, and providing value for developers at different skill levels.

4) It investigates developers' perspectives on explanations and suggestions provided alongside CI build predictions related to factors like changed files in previous failures. It highlights the need to tailor these insights to specific development contexts. 

In summary, the main contribution is providing new insights into CI build failures and prediction techniques based on evidence from commercial projects and experienced industry developers. The mixed-methods analysis sheds light on the challenges, expectations, and role of human judgment involved in adopting CI prediction tools in practice.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Continuous integration (CI)
- CI build failures
- CI build prediction
- Factors influencing CI build failures (e.g. repository factors, pull request factors)
- Developer perceptions of CI build failures and predictions
- Explanations and suggestions for CI build predictions
- Improving CI processes
- Adoption of CI build prediction techniques

The paper investigates CI build failures and predictions within the context of Atlassian's software development environment. It conducts both quantitative analysis to identify factors related to build failures, as well as a qualitative survey to understand developers' perspectives. Key goals are understanding challenges involving CI build failures, examining usefulness of build predictions, and gathering developer feedback on explainability of predictions to aid adoption. So the main keywords cover continuous integration, build outcomes, prediction techniques, explanatory factors, and practitioner viewpoints.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes both quantitative analysis and a survey study. What are the benefits of using a mixed methods approach in this research context compared to using only one method? How do the quantitative and qualitative findings complement each other?

2. Logistic regression is used to model the relationship between explanatory factors and CI build outcomes. What are some limitations of this technique? What alternative predictive modeling approaches could be used and what would be their advantages/disadvantages? 

3. The paper found repository dimension factors to be most strongly associated with build failures. However, the survey focused on perceptions of PR dimension factors. Why was this design choice made and what rationale was provided? What value could there have been in also surveying perceptions of repository factors?

4. The authors acknowledge that their dataset was constrained, lacking some potentially relevant explanatory variables like human factors. If access to additional variables was possible, what other factors should be considered and why? 

5. How robust are the quantitative findings to variations in how the response variable (build outcome) is defined? Could using alternative definitions like build duration lead to different results about important factors?

6. What are some ways the authors could have evaluated to what extent survey participants represent the overall population of Atlassian developers? Do you think the sample was representative?

7. For the UI prototype in the survey, what other aspects of the prediction output besides likelihood, factors, explanation, and suggestion could have been displayed? Would visualizing model confidence improve developer trust?

8. How could the authors have quantitatively measured developersâ€™ trust in the predictions (e.g. via an additional survey question)? Why would measuring trust be valuable?

9. The paper argues developers should not over-rely on automated predictions. How could the UI be designed to find the right balance between utilizing predictions while maintaining human judgment and oversight?

10. What steps could the authors take to turn these research findings into actual practice? What implementation and evaluation challenges might arise in transitioning the ideas to a real production system?
