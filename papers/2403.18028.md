# [Predicting Species Occurrence Patterns from Partial Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the important problem of predicting species occurrence and distribution patterns from limited observational data. Many species groups like insects and amphibians have very sparse observational records compared to birds. However, there are ecological correlations across taxa that can potentially be exploited to make better predictions. The paper introduces a novel practical task of "checklist completion" - predicting full species occurrence rates given partial observations of some species.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new model called R-Tran to address this problem. R-Tran is based on a transformer architecture and takes as input (a) satellite imagery features, (b) target embeddings representing species labels, (c) state embeddings indicating whether each species label is known/unknown. It models interactions between imagery features and label information. The design allows incorporation of any partial species observations during inference.

The paper also introduces SatButterfly, a new dataset of butterfly observations and colocated satellite imagery, with a subset overlapped with the existing SatBird dataset. This enables cross-taxon learning experiments between birds and butterflies.

Contributions:
- Formulation of a practical checklist completion task to predict full species occurrence patterns from partial observations 
- R-Tran, a transformer-based model to exploit partial species observations by modelling interactions between input features and output labels
- SatButterfly dataset with satellite imagery mapped to butterfly observations, overlapping with SatBird
- Experiments demonstrating that R-Tran outperforms baselines in predicting occurrences within taxon (birds) and across taxa (birds and butterflies) using partial observations.

The work offers new ability to leverage insights from well-observed species like birds to predict distributions of under-observed but threatened species groups, helping address twin climate and biodiversity crises.
