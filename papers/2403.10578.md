# [Generative Modelling of Stochastic Rotating Shallow Water Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Stochastic parametrization addresses uncertainty in numerical weather and climate prediction models. Recent works have calibrated stochastic parameters using a Gaussian assumption for the noise increments, but this is not always realistic. 

- This paper proposes a new methodology for calibrating stochastic parameters that avoids the Gaussian assumption, using a generative model approach.

Methodology:
- The methodology is applied to stochastic rotating shallow water (RSW) equations. The RSW model is perturbed by spatial noise which compensates for the loss of scales when simulating on a coarse grid versus a fine grid.    

- Previously the noise was modeled by a principal component analysis (PCA) method which assumed Gaussian increments. This is replaced by a diffusion generative model which can learn more complex non-Gaussian distributions directly from data.

- Specifically, a diffusion Schr√∂dinger bridge model is used. It gradually diffuses real data into Gaussian noise, learning mappings between them. Sampling the reverse process generates new non-Gaussian data.

Experiments:
- The methodology is demonstrated on synthetic RSW simulation data. The generative model successfully models a non-Gaussian distribution for the spatial noise perturbations, verified using statistical testing.

- Ensemble forecast experiments show the generative noise outperforms Gaussian noise in terms of RMSE, CRPS skill scores and rank histograms when there is low initial uncertainty. This indicates it better captures unresolved fine scale dynamics.

Main Contributions:
- A new methodology to calibrate stochastic parameters in numerical weather/climate models without assuming Gaussian noise, using generative modelling.

- Demonstrated for an RSW model, learns non-Gaussian spatial noise to compensate for unresolved scales. Outperforms Gaussian noise in ensemble forecast experiments when there is low initial uncertainty.

- Overall the paper shows generative models are a promising data-driven tool for quantifying uncertainty from unresolved scales in fluid models.
