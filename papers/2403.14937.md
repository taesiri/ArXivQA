# [Survey on Modeling of Articulated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the research area of 3D modeling of articulated objects. Articulated objects refer to objects composed of multiple rigid parts that are interconnected by joints, allowing motion between the parts. Modeling these objects is challenging as it requires understanding both the geometry of the individual parts as well as the kinematic structure describing their motion. 

The paper reviews techniques for two key tasks: (1) articulated part perception - detecting and segmenting object parts while estimating articulation parameters, and (2) articulated object creation - reconstructing or generating full 3D models of articulated objects that can be animated.

The survey structures its analysis along two main axes - geometry processing and articulation modeling. Geometry processing involves representing and analyzing the shape of articulated parts. Common geometric representations include meshes, point clouds, and implicit neural fields. Articulation modeling focuses on capturing part mobility and kinematic structure, using representations like joint parameters, kinematic trees, and deformation flows. 

The paper discusses assumptions, representations, and methodologies adopted in literature for both tasks. For part perception, key trends involve supervised and self-supervised deep learning on point clouds and images. For object creation, neural implicit representations combined with learning strategies enable generating animated models.

The survey also highlights key challenges like generalizing across diverse objects, improving robustness of perception, incorporating physics-based constraints, and modeling complex part geometries. It outlines promising future directions such as leveraging generative AI, improving detail of reconstructed models, and better handling of real-world noise.

Overall, this paper serves as an excellent reference source for researchers in computer vision and graphics working on modeling articulated objects. By systematically addressing techniques and challenges, it offers valuable insights to advance research in this complex domain.
