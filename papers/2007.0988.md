# [The Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating Conjecture. I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.0988)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is proving the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals of the critical line. Specifically, the paper proves that for most $t$ in the interval [T, 2T], the maximum of |zeta(1/2 + it + ih)| over |h| <= 1 is bounded above by (log T) / (log log T)^{3/4} with high probability. This matches the prediction made by the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture.The key contributions are:- Proving a sharp upper bound on the maximum with uniform and optimal decay rates in the deviation parameter y. This goes beyond what is known for analogous questions in random matrix theory.- Developing an iterative multiscale scheme involving upper and lower barriers to control the maximum. This allows bypassing limitations of current number theory techniques for handling long Dirichlet polynomials.- Establishing new estimates on twisted moments of the zeta function to implement the iterative scheme.So in summary, the central hypothesis tested is the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of zeta, and the main contribution is proving the optimal upper bound part of this conjecture via new iterative and probabilistic techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on skimming through the paper, here is a one sentence summary: This paper establishes an upper bound for the maximum values of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals along the critical line, settling the upper bound part of a conjecture by Fyodorov, Hiary and Keating regarding the distribution of these maximum values.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper on the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture compares to other related research:- This paper makes significant progress on a major open problem in analytic number theory - establishing the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals of the critical line. This conjecture was motivated by analogous predictions from random matrix theory, so the progress on the zeta function side represents an advance over what was previously known.- The techniques used draw on both analytic number theory and probability theory, combining precise estimates for moments of zeta and Dirichlet L-functions with iterative arguments using barrier methods from probability. This demonstrates the power of combining tools from multiple fields to attack difficult problems in number theory.- Previous work on the zeta maximum problem, such as by Najnudel, Harper, and Arguin et al, had reached first and second order asymptotics. By pushing to higher moments and introducing new iterative arguments, this paper goes substantially further in determining the precise order of magnitude.- On the random matrix side, the analogous problem of understanding the maximum eigenvalue remains open, with only tightness results known so far. So this paper establishes a rare instance of stronger results being proved for the number theory problem compared to the random matrix analogue.- The introduction cites connections to work on branching random walks and Gaussian free fields, where sharp tail decay has been established in some cases. This paper adds to that body of techniques by developing a tailored iterative approach for the zeta function, rather than relying on existing probabilistic methods.So in summary, this paper makes significant new progress on a major open problem, demonstrates the potential of blending techniques from multiple fields, and develops innovative arguments to push beyond prior barriers - representing a meaningful advance for the field. The results also highlight fascinating parallels between number theory and probability.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Proving matching lower bounds for Theorem 1. The authors state they will establish lower bounds in a subsequent paper, which would complement the upper bound proved here.- Extending the methods to establish analogous results for the global maximum of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. The authors suggest their techniques for studying the local maximum may also be relevant for the global maximum problem.- Further developing the connections to random matrix theory suggested by the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture. In particular, obtaining analogous results for the maximum eigenvalues of random matrices.- Investigating whether the methods can be adapted to handle a wider class of $L$-functions beyond the Riemann zeta function. The iterative scheme and use of twisted moments may generalize to other $L$-functions.- Optimizing the error terms and ranges of uniformity in the main theorems. There may be room to tweak the methods to strengthen the results.- Obtaining asymptotics for the distribution function $F(y)$ conjectured by Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating. The upper tail decay rate has now been established but determining the full distribution remains open.- Further developing the connections to branching random walks suggested by the heuristic explanations. The links to these probabilistic models could lead to new insights.In summary, the key suggested directions are sharpening the results for the Riemann zeta function, extending the techniques to related problems, and further exploring the probabilistic interpretations and models. The authors have provided a framework that opens up many possibilities for future work.
