# [The Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating Conjecture. I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.0988)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is proving the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals of the critical line. 

Specifically, the paper proves that for most $t$ in the interval [T, 2T], the maximum of |zeta(1/2 + it + ih)| over |h| <= 1 is bounded above by (log T) / (log log T)^{3/4} with high probability. This matches the prediction made by the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture.

The key contributions are:

- Proving a sharp upper bound on the maximum with uniform and optimal decay rates in the deviation parameter y. This goes beyond what is known for analogous questions in random matrix theory.

- Developing an iterative multiscale scheme involving upper and lower barriers to control the maximum. This allows bypassing limitations of current number theory techniques for handling long Dirichlet polynomials.

- Establishing new estimates on twisted moments of the zeta function to implement the iterative scheme.

So in summary, the central hypothesis tested is the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of zeta, and the main contribution is proving the optimal upper bound part of this conjecture via new iterative and probabilistic techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on skimming through the paper, here is a one sentence summary: 

This paper establishes an upper bound for the maximum values of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals along the critical line, settling the upper bound part of a conjecture by Fyodorov, Hiary and Keating regarding the distribution of these maximum values.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper on the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture compares to other related research:

- This paper makes significant progress on a major open problem in analytic number theory - establishing the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals of the critical line. This conjecture was motivated by analogous predictions from random matrix theory, so the progress on the zeta function side represents an advance over what was previously known.

- The techniques used draw on both analytic number theory and probability theory, combining precise estimates for moments of zeta and Dirichlet L-functions with iterative arguments using barrier methods from probability. This demonstrates the power of combining tools from multiple fields to attack difficult problems in number theory.

- Previous work on the zeta maximum problem, such as by Najnudel, Harper, and Arguin et al, had reached first and second order asymptotics. By pushing to higher moments and introducing new iterative arguments, this paper goes substantially further in determining the precise order of magnitude.

- On the random matrix side, the analogous problem of understanding the maximum eigenvalue remains open, with only tightness results known so far. So this paper establishes a rare instance of stronger results being proved for the number theory problem compared to the random matrix analogue.

- The introduction cites connections to work on branching random walks and Gaussian free fields, where sharp tail decay has been established in some cases. This paper adds to that body of techniques by developing a tailored iterative approach for the zeta function, rather than relying on existing probabilistic methods.

So in summary, this paper makes significant new progress on a major open problem, demonstrates the potential of blending techniques from multiple fields, and develops innovative arguments to push beyond prior barriers - representing a meaningful advance for the field. The results also highlight fascinating parallels between number theory and probability.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Proving matching lower bounds for Theorem 1. The authors state they will establish lower bounds in a subsequent paper, which would complement the upper bound proved here.

- Extending the methods to establish analogous results for the global maximum of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. The authors suggest their techniques for studying the local maximum may also be relevant for the global maximum problem.

- Further developing the connections to random matrix theory suggested by the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture. In particular, obtaining analogous results for the maximum eigenvalues of random matrices.

- Investigating whether the methods can be adapted to handle a wider class of $L$-functions beyond the Riemann zeta function. The iterative scheme and use of twisted moments may generalize to other $L$-functions.

- Optimizing the error terms and ranges of uniformity in the main theorems. There may be room to tweak the methods to strengthen the results.

- Obtaining asymptotics for the distribution function $F(y)$ conjectured by Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating. The upper tail decay rate has now been established but determining the full distribution remains open.

- Further developing the connections to branching random walks suggested by the heuristic explanations. The links to these probabilistic models could lead to new insights.

In summary, the key suggested directions are sharpening the results for the Riemann zeta function, extending the techniques to related problems, and further exploring the probabilistic interpretations and models. The authors have provided a framework that opens up many possibilities for future work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proving the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals of the critical line. Specifically, the authors show that for most $t$ in the interval [T, 2T], the maximum of |zeta(1/2 + it + ih)| over |h| <= 1 is bounded above by (log T) / (log log T)^{3/4}, with a certain tail decay. This settles the upper bound portion of the conjecture in a strong form, with sharp uniform decay rates. The proof relies on an iteration scheme involving upper and lower barriers for the values of partial sums of the zeta function at multiple scales. The bound obtained is expected to be optimal up to log log factors. The authors state they will complement this with matching lower bounds in a subsequent paper. Overall, this seems to represent progress on understanding the local maximum of the zeta function and provides evidence for the predictions coming from analogies with random matrix theory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proves the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line over short intervals. Specifically, the authors show that for most $t$ in the interval [T, 2T], the maximum of |ζ(1/2 + it + ih)| over |h| ≤ 1 is bounded above by (log T)/(log log T)^{3/4} with high probability. The proof relies on an iterative scheme that constructs upper and lower barriers for the values of partial sums of the zeta function at different scales. Each step of the iteration uses elaborate second and twisted fourth moments of the zeta function. This upper bound matches the prediction from the analogy with random matrix theory and is sharper than previous results, giving a uniform exponential decay in the deviation parameter y.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proves the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the distribution of the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line over short intervals. Specifically, the authors show that the measure of those t in [T,2T] for which the maximum of |zeta(1/2 + it + ih)| over |h| ≤ 1 exceeds (log T)/(loglog T)^{3/4} is bounded by Ce^{-2y} for y ≥ 1. This upper bound matches the prediction from the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture and is sharper than analogous results for random matrices.  

The proof relies on an iterative scheme that constructs upper and lower barriers for the values of partial sums of the zeta function at different scales. Each step of the iteration uses sophisticated estimates on the second and twisted fourth moments of zeta to control the deviations of these partial sums. The lower barrier reduces the number of shifts h that need to be considered for the maximum, enabling the use of smaller values for the partial sums so that the moment estimates have sufficiently small errors. The reduction in shifts also improves the approximation of log|zeta| by partial sums at subsequent scales. Overall, this multiscale analysis allows the authors to establish the conjectured upper bound on the maximum of zeta over short intervals.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper establishes an upper bound on the large values of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals of the critical line, settling the upper bound part of a conjecture of Fyodorov, Hiary and Keating. The proof relies on an iterative scheme that recursively constructs upper and lower barriers for the values of partial sums S_k of the zeta function as k approaches log log T. Each step of the iteration uses elaborate second and twisted fourth moments of zeta, which provide probabilistic control on the increments S_{k+1}-S_k. The lower barrier reduces the number of shifts h that need to be considered for the maximum of zeta. This improves the approximation of log|zeta| by the Dirichlet sums S_k in subsequent steps. The iterative scheme continues until k is large enough that Dirichlet polynomials can be used to control the maximum directly. The method ultimately shows the measure of points t in [T,2T] where the maximum of zeta is large decays exponentially in y, matching the prediction from random matrix theory.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of understanding the distribution of the maximum of the Riemann zeta function over short intervals on the critical line. Specifically, it is concerned with proving the upper bound part of a conjecture made by Fyodorov, Hiary and Keating on this maximum. 

The key question the paper seeks to address is: what is the typical size of the maximum of |zeta(1/2 + it)| over an interval of length 1 when t is chosen randomly in [T, 2T]?

Fyodorov, Hiary and Keating conjectured that this maximum should be around (log T)/(log log T)^{3/4}. Proving tight upper bounds for this maximum has been an open problem.

This paper makes progress on this conjecture by establishing a strong upper bound that matches the conjectured order of magnitude and also gives a sharp exponential decay as the maximum gets large. Specifically, the main result is:

Theorem: For any y≥1, the measure of t in [T, 2T] for which max_{|h|≤1} |zeta(1/2 + it + ih)| > e^y (log T)/(log log T)^{3/4} is bounded by Cy exp(-2y) for some absolute constant C>0. 

This upper bound is expected to be optimal when y is of order sqrt(log log T) and provides the first result with uniform exponential decay in y. The proof relies on an iterative multiscale analysis using second and fourth moments of zeta.

So in summary, this paper makes progress on the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture by establishing a strong upper bound on the maximum of zeta over short intervals, with tight exponential decay. The proof introduces new techniques based on an iterative scheme and twisted moments.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper settles the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the local maxima of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. The conjecture proposes that the measure of t in [T,2T] for which the maximum of |zeta(1/2+it+ih)| for |h|<=1 exceeds a threshold grows as e^{-2y} for large y. 

The main result of the paper is to prove a strong upper bound matching this conjecture, showing that for y>=1 the measure is bounded by Cy*e^{-2y} uniformly. This decay in y is sharper than known results for analogous problems in random matrix theory, making this a rare instance of a stronger result obtained first for the zeta function.

The proof relies on an iterative scheme that constructs upper and lower barriers for the values of partial sums S_k of the zeta function as k approaches loglog(T). Each iteration step uses elaborate second and twisted fourth moments of zeta, which may be independent interest. The lower barrier reduces the number of h's that need to be considered for the maximum, enabling the use of smaller values of the S_k sums so that only moments with good errors are required.

The paper settles a longstanding open problem on the fine-scale structure of the zeta function on the critical line. The upper bound proof is constructive and paves the way for subsequent work obtaining matching lower bounds. The barrier method developed illustrates a powerful technique for analyzing maxima of zeta and related functions.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper settles the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals of the critical line. More precisely, the authors show that the measure of those $T \leq t \leq 2T$ for which the maximum of $|\zeta(\frac{1}{2} + it + ih)|$ over $|h| \leq 1$ is larger than $e^y (\log T) / (\log\log T)^{3/4}$ decays as $C y e^{-2y}$ uniformly in $y \geq 1$.
