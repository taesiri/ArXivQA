# [The Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating Conjecture. I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.0988)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is proving the upper bound part of the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals of the critical line. Specifically, the paper proves that for most $t$ in the interval [T, 2T], the maximum of |zeta(1/2 + it + ih)| over |h| <= 1 is bounded above by (log T) / (log log T)^{3/4} with high probability. This matches the prediction made by the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture.The key contributions are:- Proving a sharp upper bound on the maximum with uniform and optimal decay rates in the deviation parameter y. This goes beyond what is known for analogous questions in random matrix theory.- Developing an iterative multiscale scheme involving upper and lower barriers to control the maximum. This allows bypassing limitations of current number theory techniques for handling long Dirichlet polynomials.- Establishing new estimates on twisted moments of the zeta function to implement the iterative scheme.So in summary, the central hypothesis tested is the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture on the maximum of zeta, and the main contribution is proving the optimal upper bound part of this conjecture via new iterative and probabilistic techniques.
