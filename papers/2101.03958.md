# [Evolving Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03958)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper tries to address is:

Can we automate the design of reinforcement learning algorithms by searching over the space of computational graphs that define the loss function?

The authors propose a method to automatically learn novel RL algorithms by representing the loss function as a computational graph and then using an evolutionary approach to search over this graph space. 

The key ideas are:

- Formulating RL algorithm design as a meta-learning problem. An outer loop searches over loss function graphs while an inner loop trains an agent using that loss.

- Designing a flexible search language based on computational graphs that can express symbolic loss functions and neural network modules. This enables representing a broad class of RL algorithms.

- Using an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently search over the large space of possible graphs. Techniques like functional equivalence checks and early hurdles make this more tractable.

- Bootstrapping the search from existing algorithms like DQN leads to faster learning and more interpretable results compared to learning from scratch.

- Showing that this approach can find novel algorithms that improve over DQN and generalize to unseen environments, indicating it is a promising direction for automating RL design.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that the space of computational graphs defining RL loss functions can be automatically searched to find novel and generalizable RL algorithms. The results provide support for this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A method for meta-learning reinforcement learning algorithms by searching over the space of computational graphs that compute the loss function for a value-based model-free RL agent. 

2. A search language based on genetic programming that can represent general symbolic loss functions in a domain agnostic way, enabling generalization to new environments.

3. The ability to bootstrap off existing RL algorithms like DQN by initializing the search from their computational graphs. This leads to faster learning and more interpretable algorithms. 

4. Two learned algorithms, called DQNClipped and DQNReg, which attain better performance than DQN/DDQN on a diverse set of training environments (classical control, gridworlds) and also generalize to unseen test environments like Atari games.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I would compare it to other related work:

- This paper focuses on meta-learning reinforcement learning algorithms by searching over computational graphs that define the loss function. This is a unique approach compared to other meta-RL methods like MAML, RL^2, or meta-gradients which meta-learn neural network weights or hyperparameters.

- The limitations mentioned at the end in terms of focusing only on discrete action value-based methods highlights room for future work to expand the search space to more general RL algorithms.

Overall, I would say this paper presents a unique approach to meta-learning RL algorithms with computational graphs and makes contributions in showing these algorithms can generalize and resemble recent algorithmic advances. The idea of evolving RL algorithms and analysis relating learned programs to new research directions are the key novelties compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding the search space of RL algorithms beyond discrete action, value-based methods like DQN. They mention exploring actor-critic methods, policy gradient methods, and incorporating the action selection strategy into the search space.

- Expanding the diversity of environments used for meta-training and testing. They trained on simple classical control and gridworld tasks and tested on Atari games. Using a wider variety of environments during meta-training could potentially lead to algorithms that generalize even better.

- Further analysis and investigation of the simple but well-performing learned loss function $L = \delta^2 + k*Q(s_t,a_t)$. The authors suggest this loss could benefit from environment-specific tuning of the parameter k.

- Applying the method to learn other components of RL algorithms besides just the loss function, such as learn bonuses for exploration.

- Scaling up the method with more compute to search over larger spaces of programs and for longer. This could enable discovering more complex and better performing algorithms.

- Comparing learned algorithms to a broader set of RL algorithms, especially recent innovations. This could reveal more connections between automatically learned and human designed algorithms.

- Developing better metrics for scoring algorithms during meta-training that go beyond just training return. This could help learn algorithms that are even more generalizable and stable.

Overall, the authors propose several promising directions to build on their method and expand the scope of what automated RL algorithm design can accomplish. The key next steps seem to be scaling up the search, expanding the search space, and diversifying the training environments.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for meta-learning reinforcement learning algorithms by searching over the space of computational graphs that compute the loss function for a value-based model-free RL agent. The learned algorithms are domain-agnostic and can generalize to new environments not seen during training. The method uses a genetic programming approach called regularized evolution to efficiently search over the space of programs expressed in a domain specific language. This language allows representing algorithms as directed acyclic graphs with typed inputs/outputs and supports basic math operations as well as neural network modules. 

Experiments compare learning from scratch versus bootstrapping off existing algorithms like DQN. While learning from scratch can rediscover known algorithms like TD, bootstrapping leads to better performance and interpretable improvements over DQN. Two highlighted learned algorithms, termed DQNReg and DQNClipped, outperform DQN and DDQN on a diverse set of training environments and generalize to unseen test environments including Atari games. Analysis shows the learned algorithms act as regularizers, restricting overestimated Q-values, resembling innovations in recent RL algorithms. Overall, the proposed approach can automate and improve RL algorithm design.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The outer loop optimization uses regularized evolution, a variant of genetic programming, to search over programs represented as computational graphs with typed inputs/outputs.
