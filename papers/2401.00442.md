## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses several camera projection models like equidistant, equiangular, orthographic, and stereographic. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these models and how they map 3D points onto the 2D image plane? What are the trade-offs of using each model?

2. The polynomial distortion model approximates distortions using polynomial functions. How is the order of the polynomial function chosen? What are the effects of using an overly simple or complex polynomial model? 

3. For the Brown-Conrady distortion model, when is it necessary to use the higher order terms beyond $k_1$ and $k_2$? What types of lens assemblies would require the extra terms?

4. How does the Kannala-Brandt distortion model differ from traditional models like Brown-Conrady? Why does it use the angle of incidence rather than radial distance to parameterize distortions?

5. The paper discusses various feature-based methods. Can you explain how line detection techniques are able to infer the distortion parameters? What is the underlying geometric principle?  

6. What are the trade-offs between direct methods and calibration-based methods for estimating distortion parameters? When would you choose one over the other?

7. For learning-based methods, what are some key considerations and challenges when curating the training data pairs of distorted/undistorted images?

8. The paper mentions encoder-decoder architectures for distortion correction. Can you explain the motivation behind this type of architecture compared to other CNN architectures? 

9. How do the adversarial and perceptual losses used in GAN-based approaches help improve the quality of corrected images compared to just using L2 losses?

10. Can you discuss some practical challenges and failure cases when applying these distortion correction methods on real-world fisheye images? How might the performance degrade?
