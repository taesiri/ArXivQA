# [Learning to optimize with convergence guarantees using nonlinear system   theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09389)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Numerical optimization algorithms are increasingly used to solve complex problems in machine learning and control of dynamical systems. However, classical optimization methods like gradient descent require careful tuning of hyperparameters and may perform poorly on non-convex problems.  
- The emerging "learning to optimize" (L2O) paradigm uses machine learning models trained on data to discover better optimization algorithms automatically. But existing L2O methods lack theoretical guarantees on convergence and robustness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a framework to learn provably convergent optimization algorithms for smooth non-convex functions, by combining ideas from nonlinear control theory and L2O.
- Key idea: Decompose any convergent update rule into (i) a gradient descent step that ensures convergence (ii) an "innovation" term modeled via a stable recurrent neural network, which is learned to improve performance.
- For the full batch gradient case, the paper gives a complete parametrization of all algorithms that converge in sum-square sense. For stochastic batch gradients, it parametrizes all asymptotically convergent rules.
- This approach guarantees convergence by design when learning to optimize, without needing additional constraints or safeguarding mechanisms.

Main Contributions:
- Novel problem formulation that enables unconstrained learning of provably convergent algorithms via automatic differentiation.
- Theoretical analysis showing the proposed parametrizations capture all possible convergent behaviors, avoiding conservatism.
- Demonstration on NN training that the learned optimizer generalizes well, achieving faster training and better test accuracy compared to popular hand-designed methods.
- The work combines strengths of control theory and L2O - convergence guarantees with ability to optimize complex performance metrics.

In summary, the paper develops a principled approach to learn optimization algorithms that are guaranteed to converge, while retaining the flexibility of L2O for applications like machine learning. The theory-driven formulation, analysis of completeness, and experimental validation are the main contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework to learn optimization algorithms with guaranteed convergence for smooth non-convex functions by parametrizing all convergent update rules and enabling unconstrained optimization over them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a methodology for learning optimization algorithms that are inherently convergent for smooth non-convex functions. Specifically:

- It provides a parametrization of all convergent algorithms for smooth non-convex optimization that comply with sum-square convergence guarantees. This enables unconstrained learning of provably convergent algorithms.

- For the case where only batch gradients are available, it parametrizes a rich class of asymptotically convergent algorithms.

- The proposed methodology bridges control theory and learning to optimize approaches. It guarantees convergence by design in learning algorithm parameters, while enabling the optimization of customizable performance metrics through automatic differentiation.

- Numerical results on training neural networks show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its ability to generalize to unseen activation functions and initial parameter distributions.

In summary, the key innovation is an unconstrained parametrization of convergent algorithms that makes their meta-optimization amenable to automatic differentiation, ensuring convergence guarantees during meta-learning. This enables the discovery of reliable and high-performance learned optimizers.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Learning to optimize (L2O): The emerging paradigm of using machine learning models and data to automate the discovery of optimization algorithms with improved performance.

- Convergence guarantees: Ensuring that learned optimization algorithms provably converge to critical points or solutions, which is important for reliability and generalization. 

- Nonlinear system theory: Using concepts and tools from control theory and dynamical systems to analyze convergence and robustness properties of optimization algorithms.

- Smooth non-convex optimization: The paper focuses on optimizing smooth (differentiable) functions that are non-convex, which includes many problems in machine learning.  

- Complete parametrization: The paper provides a full characterization of all convergent algorithms for a given class of problems in terms of some core components like gradient descent and an innovation term.

- Meta-optimization: The process of optimizing over a parametrized family of algorithms to find the optimal parameters that minimize a chosen meta-loss function, reflecting the algorithm's speed and solution quality.

- Batch gradients: The case where only partial gradient information is available at each iteration, which is common in machine learning with finite sample sizes. The results address convergence guarantees even in this setting.

In summary, the key focus is on bringing convergence guarantees to learning-based design of optimization algorithms, especially for non-convex problems, using concepts from nonlinear control theory.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper parametrizes convergent optimization algorithms by separating them into a gradient descent component and an innovation component. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this separation approach? How does it compare to directly parametrizing the full update rule?

2) The paper claims the parametrization using the innovation signal $\mathbf{v}$ encompasses all possible convergent algorithms. Provide a detailed proof sketch validating or critiquing this claim. 

3) The recurrent neural network architecture used to model the innovation signal $\mathbf{V}(\theta)$ is crucial for guaranteeing stability. Discuss the pros and cons of different state-of-the-art RNN options for this modeling choice.

4) The paper advocates using custom performance metrics blending speed and solution quality. Propose an alternative metric and formulate the end-to-end methodology to optimize it. How does your choice of metric affect the landscape navigated during meta-optimization?

5) The methodology is showcased on shallow NNs. Discuss the expected challenges and benefits when applying it to optimize training of larger scale deep networks. Would you suggest any modifications to the approach?

6) Theorems 1 and 2 provide completeness guarantees for the full and partial gradient observation cases. Critically analyze the assumptions made in these results and their restrictiveness in practice. 

7) Assess the generalizability of the proposed methodology when the meta-training set $\mathcal{F}$ has limited coverage over the space of possible objective functions compared to the target deployment setting. Suggest ways to mitigate this issue.

8) The paper considers unconstrained optimization problems. Formulate an extension of the methodology to accommodate constraints and analyze the additional complexity introduced.

9) Discuss the similarities and differences between the proposed approach and bilevel optimization methods for algorithm design. What are the pros and cons of each?

10) The paper focuses on algorithms that converge to critical points of non-convex functions. How would you modify the methodology to provably escape saddle points and converge to local minima?
