# [All You Need is RAW: Defending Against Adversarial Attacks with Camera   Image Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09219)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: How can we exploit the raw image domain and image processing pipeline statistics as an empirical prior to defend against adversarial attacks on neural networks?In particular, the authors propose a new defense method that maps adversarially perturbed RGB images to raw sensor measurements and then reconstructs clean RGB images via learned and conventional image processing pipelines. The key hypothesis is that mapping through the intermediate raw image space, which captures natural image statistics before processing, can help remove adversarial perturbations more effectively compared to existing defenses that operate solely in RGB space.The experiments validate this hypothesis by showing their method outperforms previous input transformation defenses across different vision tasks and datasets. The ablation studies provide further analysis on how the raw image domain helps defend against adversarial attacks.In summary, the main novelty is using the raw image distribution and image processing pipelines as an empirical prior, rather than relying only on RGB image statistics as most prior work. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for adversarial defense.
