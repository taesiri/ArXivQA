# [Image-free Classifier Injection for Zero-Shot Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10599)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is: Given a pre-trained image classification model and a set of new classes not in the original training data, can we extend the model to classify images from the new classes, without having access to any image data for the new classes?Specifically, the paper proposes a method to inject new classifier weights into a pre-trained model to enable zero-shot classification of unseen classes, using only class-level semantic descriptors (like attributes or word embeddings) and the existing classifier weights for seen classes. The key hypothesis is that the classifier weights of a trained model already encode visual-semantic knowledge about the seen classes, which can be exploited along with semantic descriptors to infer classifier weights for novel unseen classes without needing any image data.In summary, this paper introduces a new "image-free zero-shot learning" task and proposes a method called ICIS to address it by predicting new classifier weights using only class descriptors and existing weights, without relying on any image data. The central hypothesis is that this approach can equip pre-trained models with zero-shot classification capabilities in a post-hoc manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method to extend a pre-trained image classification model to new unseen classes without needing access to any images from either the seen or unseen classes. Specifically:- The paper proposes the task of "image-free zero-shot learning" (I-ZSL), where the goal is to perform zero-shot classification by injecting new classifier weights into a pre-trained model, without using any images from seen or unseen classes. This is a more challenging setting than standard zero-shot learning.- To tackle this task, the paper introduces a framework called Image-free Classifier Injection with Semantics (ICIS). ICIS consists of encoder-decoder networks that learn to map between class descriptors (e.g. attributes) and classifier weights for seen classes. - At test time, ICIS can take as input the descriptor for an unseen class and predict corresponding classifier weights, which are then injected into the pre-trained model to extend it to the new classes.- Experiments on standard zero-shot learning benchmarks like CUB, SUN and AWA2 show that ICIS can effectively perform I-ZSL, outperforming adapted zero-shot and few-shot learning methods. ICIS reduces bias towards seen classes and shows improved generalization compared to a simple MLP baseline.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the I-ZSL task and an effective framework (ICIS) to perform zero-shot classification and expand pre-trained models to new classes without needing any images, which has practical benefits in situations where collecting new training data is difficult.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called Image-free Classifier Injection with Semantics (ICIS) that can extend a pre-trained image classification model to recognize new unseen classes without using any images, by learning to predict classifier weights for the new classes using only class-level semantic descriptors (like attributes or word embeddings) paired with weights from the seen classes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several important contributions to the field of image-free zero-shot learning:1. It proposes a novel task, image-free zero-shot learning (I-ZSL), where the goal is to perform zero-shot classification using a pre-trained model without access to any images from seen or unseen classes. This is a very challenging and realistic setting not explored in previous work.2. The paper introduces a simple yet effective framework called ICIS for I-ZSL. ICIS has encoder-decoder networks to map between class descriptors and classifier weights, using cross-reconstruction and cosine losses. This allows extending pre-trained models to new classes using only class descriptors.3. Experiments on standard ZSL datasets like CUB, SUN and AWA2 show ICIS outperforms adapted state-of-the-art ZSL and few-shot learning methods in both standard and generalized I-ZSL. ICIS also works with different pre-trained models and embeddings, demonstrating its robustness.4. Analyses reveal each component of ICIS helps deal with bias towards seen classes and improve generalization, despite no access to images. The method also encodes visual-semantic knowledge to capture distinctive properties of unseen classes.Overall, this paper pioneers the idea of I-ZSL and presents a simple approach that works surprisingly well. It opens up possibilities for zero-shot learning without images, which has practical value. Compared to other ZSL methods, this paper has a very different goal of adapting pretrained models without any images. So it is not directly comparable. The experiments adapting strong ZSL baselines to the I-ZSL setting demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ICIS approach in this new setting. The analyses also provide useful insights on how to perform I-ZSL effectively.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing methods for the image-free zero-shot learning (I-ZSL) setting that can work directly from generic pre-trained models like CLIP, without requiring any fine-tuning on seen classes related to the target task. The authors note that while CLIP can perform zero-shot transfer, I-ZSL specifically targets adapting models specialized for certain tasks. Combining I-ZSL techniques like theirs with CLIP could be an interesting direction.- Exploring different ways to obtain class descriptors beyond standard attributes, especially unsupervised methods like language models and word embeddings. The authors show results using different embeddings, but suggest there is room for improvement.- Applying I-ZSL to settings beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc. The authors formulate I-ZSL for standard classification, but the idea could extend to other vision tasks using task-specific pre-trained models.- Developing theoretical understandings of why and how I-ZSL works, and relating it to the broader ZSL literature. The paper empirically validates their approach, but does not provide a theoretical analysis.- Considering the interplay between I-ZSL and incremental/continual learning. The authors relate I-ZSL to incremental learning works, but do not explore combining the two areas.- Applying I-ZSL to real-world applications where model updating is needed but access to training data is limited. The paper focuses on standard ZSL benchmarks, but applying I-ZSL in practical settings is an important direction.In summary, the main future directions are developing variants of I-ZSL that work from generic pre-trained models, using better semantic descriptors, extending I-ZSL beyond classification, providing theoretical understandings, combining with incremental learning, and validating the approach on real applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called Image-free Classifier Injection with Semantics (ICIS) for performing zero-shot classification on new unseen classes by injecting classifiers into a pre-trained model, without needing any images from seen or unseen classes during training. ICIS uses class-level semantic descriptors (e.g. attributes or word embeddings) along with classifier weights for seen classes to learn mappings between the semantic and weight spaces. It consists of encoder-decoder networks that map inputs within and across the two spaces to learn aligned latent representations that preserve semantic structure, supervised only using the seen class descriptor-weight pairs. During inference, the descriptor encoder and weights decoder are used to predict weights for an unseen class given its descriptor, which are then injected into the pre-trained model to extend its classification capabilities. Experiments on ZSL datasets show ICIS outperforms adapted zero- and few-shot learning methods in this challenging setting, effectively inferring unseen classifiers and providing strong zero-shot classification, especially in the generalized setting, without any image data. The simple framework and minimal assumptions make ICIS widely applicable for extending pre-trained models with zero-shot classification abilities post-hoc when training data is unavailable.
