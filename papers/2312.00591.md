# [Less is More: Learning Reference Knowledge Using No-Reference Image   Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00591)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel NR-IQA framework, Reference Knowledge-guided Image Quality Transformer (RKIQT), which leverages knowledge distillation techniques to introduce comparative knowledge from reference images into an NR-IQA model. The key ideas include: (1) a non-aligned reference teacher network extracts HQ-LQ distribution differences from non-corresponding high quality reference images. (2) A Masked Quality-Contrastive Distillation mechanism transfers this knowledge to guide the training of the NR-student network. It masks the student features and forces reconstruction using the teacher's differences features as supervision. This enhances the student's comparative abilities. (3) An inductive bias regularization is proposed utilizing CNN and Involution teachers to provide rich and diverse quality-aware knowledge. This improves model convergence and generalization. Experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art NR-IQA performance. A key conclusion is that introducing comparative reference knowledge via distillation enables high accuracy NR-IQA without actual reference images. The model outperforms competitors while using less direct input.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework, Reference Knowledge-guided image quality transformer (RKIQT), to perform no-reference image quality assessment by transferring comparative knowledge from teachers to students using masked quality-contrastive distillation and inductive bias regularization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel NR-IQA framework called Reference Knowledge-guided image quality transformer (RKIQT) that learns reference information during training to perform inference without reference images. 

2) It introduces a novel feature distillation method called Masked Quality-Contrastive Distillation (MCD) to transfer comparative knowledge from a non-aligned reference teacher network to the student network. This allows the student to develop awareness for making comparisons without aligned reference images.

3) It proposes an inductive bias regularization using CNN and Involution teachers to provide local and global quality-aware knowledge to the student. This helps achieve faster convergence and avoid overfitting.

4) Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance of RKIQT on 8 benchmark NR-IQA datasets. It leverages less input while obtaining more significant improvements compared to teacher models.

In summary, the key novelty is learning reference knowledge under the no-reference setting through innovative distillation methods, which is shown to be effective and outperform previous NR-IQA techniques.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image quality assessment (IQA) methods typically require pristine reference images to effectively evaluate image quality. However, obtaining such reference images is often impractical in real-world applications. Existing no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) methods struggle to achieve strong performance without relying on reference images. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel NR-IQA framework called Reference Knowledge-guided Image Quality Transformer (RKIQT). The key idea is to learn reference knowledge under the NR-IQA setting which can provide effective quality assessment without requiring reference images at test time. 

Specifically, two main novel components are introduced:

1) Masked Quality-Contrastive Distillation (MCD): This transfers comparative quality knowledge from a non-aligned reference IQA teacher network to the NR-IQA student network. It works by masking student features and reconstructing them to match teacher difference features between non-aligned high quality and query images.

2) Inductive Bias Regularization: This transfers local and global quality information from CNN and Involution teacher networks respectively. It uses a learnable intermediate layer and reverse distillation to align and improve student knowledge.

Main Contributions:

- First work to transfer comparative quality knowledge from teachers to students under the NR-IQA setting via innovative feature distillation

- Novel MCD method to provide contrastive awareness and robust features using masked reconstruction 

- Inductive bias regularization for faster convergence and avoiding overfitting

- Surprisingly, the proposed RKIQT utilizes less input while obtaining more significant improvements over teacher models

- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance over 8 benchmark NR-IQA datasets

In summary, the paper effectively introduces reference knowledge learning to NR-IQA for the first time via masked contrastive distillation and bias regularization. This provides significant improvements without needing reference images at test time.
