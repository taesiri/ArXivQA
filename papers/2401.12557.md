# [Balancing the AI Strength of Roles in Self-Play Training with Regret   Matching+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- When training AI agents to play games with multiple roles/characters, a common approach is to train a single generalized model to control all roles. However, this can lead to imbalanced capabilities - some roles learned better strategies and dominate over others.

- Two main reasons for imbalance:
    1) Roles may be inherently unbalanced in the game design.
    2) More complex roles take longer to learn good strategies, so simpler roles dominate training.

- This is an issue because the model does not generalize evenly across all roles.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use a regret matching based algorithm to manipulate the data distribution during self-play training to promote more balanced capabilities. 

- Keep track of a regret matrix that stores the regret/advantage for each role combination. Regret indicates how much better one role performs over another.

- Use the regret values to determine sampling weights for each role combination in each training batch. Combinations with higher regret (more imbalance) get sampled more.

- This allows the model to focus more training on role combinations where it is weaker, promoting more balanced overall capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Novel use of regret matching to balance capabilities of a single model controlling different game roles
- Adaptive algorithm that manipulates sampling weights based on current capability imbalance
- Evaluation shows more balanced win rates across all role combinations compared to vanilla self-play
- Helps train generalized models with evenly distributed strengths across multiple roles/characters

The paper provides an innovative way to train more capable and generalized game AI agents using regret matching to address imbalance issues in multi-role self-play training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a regret matching based algorithm to balance the strength of an AI model controlling different roles in self-play training for competitive games.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "regret matching+" (RM+) to balance the strength and improve the generalization capability of a self-play reinforcement learning agent that controls multiple roles/characters in a competitive game. 

Specifically, the paper identifies an issue that when training a single agent to control different roles using self-play, some roles may dominate others during training due to imbalance in role design or complexity of strategies. This leads to poor generalization performance. To address this, they introduce RM+ to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution of role combinations based on the regret (win rate difference from average) for each combination. This increases sampling of poorly performing role combinations and promotes more balanced training across roles.

In essence, the main contribution is the RM+ algorithm to manipulate the data distribution in self-play to enable better generalization of a multi-role game playing agent. The method is demonstrated to reduce variance in win rates across different role combinations on a 13-role fighting game.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Self-play - The paper discusses using self-play to train AI agents for games with multiple roles/characters.

- Regret matching - The paper introduces a regret matching based algorithm (Regret Matching+) to balance the strength of different roles during self-play training.

- Generalized model - Training a single generalized model to control different roles in a game, instead of separate models for each role.

- Role strength imbalance - The issue during self-play training where some roles get much stronger than others when controlled by the same model. 

- Data manipulation - The paper manipulates the data distribution during self-play training to increase exposure to role combinations where the model is weaker.

- Competitive games - The context is training AI for competitive multiplayer games with different playable roles/characters.

- Win rate - Measuring the relative strength of roles by their win rates against each other during self-play.

- Regret matrix - A matrix tracking per-role regret values that is used to update sampling weights for role combinations.

So in summary - self-play, regret matching, generalized models, role strength balancing, data manipulation, competitive games, win rates, etc.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that balancing the strength of different roles in a game is important for developing a generalized AI model. Can you expand more on why having a balanced strength across roles is crucial for generalization?

2. Regret Matching+ is used to manipulate the data distribution during self-play training. Can you walk through the math behind how Regret Matching+ adaptively changes the sampling weights $w(i,j)$ over training iterations? 

3. The paper defines the return $r(i,j)$ for a match between roles $i$ and $j$. What are some alternative ways one could define the return to capture how well role $j$ performs against role $i$? How might changing the return definition impact training?

4. Exponential smoothing is applied to the win-rate $p(win_{i>j})$ after each match. What is the rationale behind using exponential smoothing here rather than a simple average? How does the smoothing factor γ impact learning?

5. The weight update rule has a mixing factor η that mixes in a small uniform weight even when regrets are non-zero. Why is this uniform mixture needed? What problems could arise without mixing in a uniform weight?

6. Can you think of any ways to extend or improve upon the regret matching method proposed in the paper for balancing role strengths? For example, using different regret formulas, weighting roles non-uniformly, or adding constraints during matching.

7. The evaluation only provides win-rate variance as a metric. What other metrics would better capture whether the method leads to more balanced performance across roles?

8. What types of games or scenarios do you think this regret matching approach would be most applicable for? When might it fail or not help much?

9. Can you foresee any problems in scaling this approach to games with very large numbers of roles? How might regret calculation or matching become intractable?

10. The paper focuses on balancing strength during self-play training. Could a similar regret approach be adapted to balance role strengths for human gameplay against trained AI agents? What modifications would be needed?
