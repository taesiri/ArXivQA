# [Investigating Zero-Shot Generalizability on Mandarin-English   Code-Switched ASR and Speech-to-text Translation of Recent Foundation Models   with Self-Supervision and Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00273)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code-switching speech processing remains challenging and under-explored. Prior works are task-specific and require high-quality labeled data, limiting further development.  
- Recently released large-scale self-supervised and weakly supervised models have shown promise for multilingual speech tasks, but their effectiveness on code-switching is unknown.

Methods:
- Evaluated latest self-supervised models (SeamlessM4T, SeamlessM4T v2) and weakly supervised model (Whisper-large-v3) on Mandarin-English code-switched ASR and ST, using 3 datasets (ASCEND, CSZS-correct, NTUML2021).
- Also tested variants of Whisper - prompt-based finetuning, in-context learning, concatenating language tokens - to improve code-switching capability.

Results: 
- Self-supervised models approached the performance of weakly supervised model, showing pre-training extracts useful representations. But still gaps on difficult intra-sentential code-switching.
- Whisper variants (especially in-context learning) improved performance, highlighting need for similar techniques for self-supervised models.
- Observed error patterns like spontaneous translation and mistakes on terminology, due to multi-task nature and lack of world knowledge.

Conclusions:
- Self-supervision is a promising approach for code-switching given its data efficiency.
- Models still face challenges in intra-sentential cases and lack knowledge of terminology. Techniques like in-context learning can help close the gap.
- Developing similar capabilities for self-supervised models remains an important area for future work.

Overall the key contributions are benchmarking large pre-trained models on code-switching tasks, analyzing limitations and patterns, and showing the promise of transfer learning techniques to address them.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates several recent large-scale speech models based on self-supervision and weak supervision on Mandarin-English code-switched speech recognition and translation tasks, finding that self-supervised models can approach the performance of weakly supervised models but still have limitations in modeling code-switching.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would summarize the main contributions as:

1) Exploring the limits of recent cutting-edge large-scale models based on self-supervision and weak supervision on code-switched ASR and ST. The paper evaluates models like SeamlessM4T, SeamlessM4T v2, Whisper-large-v3, and variants of Whisper on three Mandarin-English code-switched datasets.

2) Pointing out shortcomings of these models on modeling code-switching, including some error patterns due to their multi-task nature and unsatisfactory performance on corpus entirely composed of intra-sentential CS.

3) Verifying some variants of Whisper, such as prompt-conditional fine-tuning and speech-based in-context learning, can boost Whisper's performance on code-switched ASR and ST, even though not originally proposed for this scenario. The paper encourages research into developing similar techniques for self-supervised models.

In summary, the main contribution is an empirical evaluation of recent speech models on code-switched tasks, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and showing promise of techniques like in-context learning to improve self-supervised models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Code-switching (CS)
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR) 
- Speech-to-text translation (ST)
- Self-supervised learning
- Weakly supervised learning 
- Foundation models
- SeamlessM4T
- SeamlessM4T v2
- Whisper-large-v3
- Prompt-conditional fine-tuning
- Speech-based in-context learning (SICL)
- ASCEND dataset 
- CSZS-correct dataset
- NTUML2021 dataset
- Mixed error rate (MER)
- BLEU score

The paper evaluates several recent large-scale foundation models based on self-supervision or weak supervision on Mandarin-English code-switched ASR and ST tasks. It also explores variants of the Whisper model involving techniques like prompt-based conditioning and in-context learning. The key metrics used are MER for ASR and BLEU for ST, evaluated on three CS datasets. So the key terms reflect this focus and approach of the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores the limits of recent large-scale models on code-switched ASR and ST. What are some key limitations or shortcomings pointed out regarding these models' ability to handle code-switching scenarios?

2. The paper evaluates SeamlessM4T v2 as one of the self-supervised models. In what ways does SeamlessM4T v2 show promise in achieving good performance on code-switched ASR while using relatively less labeled data compared to weakly supervised models like Whisper?

3. The paper points out some common error patterns made by SeamlessM4T v2 and Whisper-large-v3 on code-switched ASR. Can you describe these error patterns and provide some analysis on why you think they occur?  

4. The paper explores the effectiveness of some variants of the Whisper model, including concatenation of language tokens, speech-based in-context learning (SICL), and prompt-conditional fine-tuning. Of these methods, which one(s) proved most effective on improving Whisper's CS ASR and ST performance? Why do you think that is?

5. When combining multiple Whisper variant methods like concatenation prompts and SICL, the paper observes some negative interactions. What explanation is provided for why simply combining all methods does not necessarily give the best performance boost?

6. The SICL method provides Whisper with a small set of in-context audio-transcription example pairs from the training split. What strategies did the authors employ for selecting these example pairs? How might the choice of examples impact performance?

7. For the prompt-conditional fine-tuned Whisper model Clairaudience, what approach did the authors take to generate relevant domain tags? Why was it not possible to generate utterance-level domain tags for one of the datasets?

8. While Whisper model variants proved effective for code-switched ASR and ST, how did these variants fall short on the CSZS-correct dataset comprised fully of intra-sentential code-switching examples? What does this suggest about the difficulty of modeling intra-sentential CS?

9. Based on the promising performance of techniques like SICL and prompt-conditional fine-tuning on Whisper, the paper suggests developing similar techniques may benefit self-supervised models as well. Can you elaborate why extending such methods to self-supervised models seems worth exploring? What kinds of benefits might they provide?

10. If you could propose an additional experiment to further analyze model performance on the code-switching tasks studied, what would it be? What open question(s) would you want that experiment to shed more light upon?
