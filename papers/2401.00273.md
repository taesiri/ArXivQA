# [Investigating Zero-Shot Generalizability on Mandarin-English   Code-Switched ASR and Speech-to-text Translation of Recent Foundation Models   with Self-Supervision and Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00273)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code-switching speech processing remains challenging and under-explored. Prior works are task-specific and require high-quality labeled data, limiting further development.  
- Recently released large-scale self-supervised and weakly supervised models have shown promise for multilingual speech tasks, but their effectiveness on code-switching is unknown.

Methods:
- Evaluated latest self-supervised models (SeamlessM4T, SeamlessM4T v2) and weakly supervised model (Whisper-large-v3) on Mandarin-English code-switched ASR and ST, using 3 datasets (ASCEND, CSZS-correct, NTUML2021).
- Also tested variants of Whisper - prompt-based finetuning, in-context learning, concatenating language tokens - to improve code-switching capability.

Results: 
- Self-supervised models approached the performance of weakly supervised model, showing pre-training extracts useful representations. But still gaps on difficult intra-sentential code-switching.
- Whisper variants (especially in-context learning) improved performance, highlighting need for similar techniques for self-supervised models.
- Observed error patterns like spontaneous translation and mistakes on terminology, due to multi-task nature and lack of world knowledge.

Conclusions:
- Self-supervision is a promising approach for code-switching given its data efficiency.
- Models still face challenges in intra-sentential cases and lack knowledge of terminology. Techniques like in-context learning can help close the gap.
- Developing similar capabilities for self-supervised models remains an important area for future work.

Overall the key contributions are benchmarking large pre-trained models on code-switching tasks, analyzing limitations and patterns, and showing the promise of transfer learning techniques to address them.
