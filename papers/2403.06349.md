# [MOAB: Multi-Modal Outer Arithmetic Block For Fusion Of Histopathological   Images And Genetic Data For Brain Tumor Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06349)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Brain tumors can be classified into grades based on their growth, with higher grades indicating more aggressive tumors. Correct diagnosis of tumor grade is important for prognosis but remains challenging even for experienced pathologists. 
- Recently, advances in molecular genetics have improved tumor classification, suggesting potential benefits from integrating histological images and genetic data for computer-aided diagnosis.
- Prior works have limitations in exploiting complementary information across modalities and focus only on predicting Grade IV tumors. Grades II and III are minorities in the dataset and have similarity that hinders classification.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Multi-modal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB) to fuse latent representations from histological images and genetic data for improved prediction of tumor grades (II, III and IV). 
- Single modality classifiers (ConvNeXt for images, MLP for genetics) are first trained to extract feature vectors. 
- Four outer arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are then applied between the feature vectors to generate four multi-modal feature maps. 
- The maps are concatenated and convolved to produce a condensed representation that is classified through fully-connected layers.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of MOAB that leverages multiple outer arithmetic operations to capture rich fused representations for multi-modal classification.
- Demonstration of MOAB's effectiveness on a brain tumor dataset, outperforming prior state-of-art in distinguishing between similar grades II and III, while achieving strong overall performance. 
- Visualizations showing MOAB's fused features achieve better inter-class separation, especially for minority grades.
- Extensive ablation studies validating the design choices and the capability of MOAB in fusing informative features across modalities.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and effective fusion technique for multi-modal classification that is shown to work very well for integrated histological and genetic analysis of brain tumor grades.
