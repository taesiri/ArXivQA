# [A Unified Pyramid Recurrent Network for Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03456)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a lightweight and effective network for video frame interpolation that can handle complex motions and scale to high resolutions. 

The key hypotheses are:

- A unified pyramid recurrent network can be effective for jointly estimating optical flow and synthesizing intermediate frames in a coarse-to-fine manner. This allows handling large motions and scaling to high resolutions.

- Iterative refinement of the interpolated frames across pyramid levels can improve robustness for large motion cases.

- Lightweight recurrent modules for flow estimation and frame synthesis are sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when integrated in the unified framework.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that a unified pyramid recurrent network with iterative refinement can achieve excellent performance for video frame interpolation, even with very lightweight modules, by exploiting the synergies between optical flow estimation and frame synthesis.
