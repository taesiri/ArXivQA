# [AgentTuning: Enabling Generalized Agent Abilities for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12823)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the generalized agent abilities of large language models while maintaining their general language model capabilities? 

The key hypothesis appears to be: By constructing a lightweight instruction-tuning dataset of agent interaction trajectories and combining it with general domain data for fine-tuning, it is possible to enhance LLMs' agent capabilities without compromising their general abilities.

In particular, the paper introduces the AgentTuning approach, which constructs the AgentInstruct dataset covering interaction trajectories across diverse agent tasks. It then employs a hybrid instruction tuning strategy to fine-tune models like LLAMA using a mix of AgentInstruct and general domain data. 

The goal is to develop models like AgentLM that show strong performance on held-in and held-out agent tasks while retaining capabilities on general NLP benchmarks. The hypothesis is that this methodology will enable agent abilities in LLMs with robust generalization, rather than just specializing them for agent tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

1. The introduction of AgentTuning, a simple and general method to enhance the agent abilities of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining their general LLM capabilities. 

2. The construction of AgentInstruct, a lightweight instruction-tuning dataset containing high-quality interaction trajectories across multiple agent tasks.

3. A hybrid instruction-tuning strategy that combines AgentInstruct with general domain data to fine-tune the Llama 2 series, resulting in the AgentLM models. 

4. Empirical evaluation showing AgentLM significantly outperforms Llama 2 on held-in and held-out agent tasks while retaining performance on general NLP benchmarks. The AgentLM-70B model matches GPT-3.5-turbo on unseen agent tasks.

5. Analysis providing insights such as the importance of general capabilities for agent task generalization and evidence that AgentTuning enables rather than causes overfitting of agent abilities.

6. The open-sourcing of the AgentInstruct dataset and AgentLM models to serve as powerful and generalizable alternatives to commercial LLMs for agent tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and evaluation of a simple yet effective approach, AgentTuning, to improve the generalized agent capabilities of LLMs without compromising their general language model abilities. The open-sourced models and data aim to bridge the gap between open-source and commercial LLMs for agent-oriented applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper presents AgentTuning, a method to enhance the agent abilities of large language models like Llama while maintaining their general capabilities, by constructing a lightweight instruction-tuning dataset AgentInstruct and employing a hybrid instruction-tuning strategy combining it with general domain data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is how I see it comparing to other research in the field:

- The paper introduces a new dataset called AgentInstruct for improving the agent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This kind of instruction-tuning dataset focused on agent tasks is novel, as most prior work has created datasets for more general instruction following. 

- The proposed method AgentTuning is unique in its hybrid instruction-tuning approach that mixes both agent-specific and general-domain data. Most prior work has focused on either specializing models for certain tasks or retaining general capabilities, but not both.

- The results demonstrate strong improvements in held-out agent tasks while maintaining performance on general NLP benchmarks. This shows robust generalization not seen in methods that overfit to specialized datasets. Only a few recent papers have shown generalization across both agent and non-agent tasks.

- The paper makes comparisons to commercial models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 which excel at agent abilities. Prior work with open-source models has not been able to match such API-based counterparts. The AgentTuned open LLM models are the first to demonstrate comparable agent capabilities.

- The open-sourced dataset, code, and models align with the recent shift toward democratizing access to capable LLMs. Many recent papers have stopped short of releasing artifacts to replicate their work.

Overall, I believe this paper makes significant contributions to the field by proposing a novel dataset, a new tuning methodology, impressive empirical results, and open resources to the community. It represents an advance in developing open LLM agents with generalized abilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring methods to further improve the generalization performance of LLMs on unseen agent tasks. The authors note that the improvement on held-out tasks is less pronounced compared to held-in tasks, indicating room for better generalization. They suggest investigating techniques like meta-learning to improve generalization.

- Studying methods to more effectively balance agent capabilities and general language abilities during training. The authors find that a mix of agent and general data is crucial but determine the optimal ratio through trials on smaller models. More principled approaches could be explored.

- Extending the AgentInstruct dataset to cover more diverse tasks and trajectories. The authors collect a relatively small dataset across few tasks. Expanding to more tasks and data could further enhance agent abilities.

- Applying the AgentTuning approach to other model architectures and modalities beyond text, such as multimodal models. The method could potentially enable agent capabilities across different types of models.

- Analyzing the agent abilities enabled through instruction tuning compared to other techniques like reinforcement learning. Comparisons could reveal strengths/weaknesses and determine suitable problem domains.

- Investigating theoretical connections between general intelligence and task performance to better understand generalization. The links between general capabilities and agent task generalization require more analysis.

In summary, the authors propose several promising directions to build on their work on improving LLMs' generalized agent abilities via instruction tuning. Advancing the generalization performance, balancing capabilities, expanding datasets, applying to new models/modalities, comparative analysis, and theoretical understanding represent fruitful areas for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces AgentTuning, a method to enhance the agent abilities of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining their general capabilities. The first component is AgentInstruct, a dataset of 1,866 high-quality interaction trajectories across six diverse agent tasks, constructed via instruction generation, trajectory interaction using GPT-4, and trajectory filtering. The second component is a hybrid instruction tuning strategy that mixes AgentInstruct data with general domain data to train the Llama 2 series, resulting in AgentLM models. Evaluations demonstrate AgentLM significantly outperforms Llama 2 on held-in and held-out agent tasks while retaining performance on general NLP benchmarks. Error analysis shows AgentTuning reduces elementary mistakes, suggesting it activates inherent agent capabilities. Ablation studies emphasize the importance of general data for generalization. The 70B AgentLM approaches GPT-3.5 on unseen tasks, indicating robust generalization. The authors have open-sourced AgentInstruct and AgentLM to serve as powerful yet general agent models.  

In summary, this paper makes the first attempt at instruction tuning LLMs using multi-task interaction trajectories to enhance generalized agent abilities. By constructing a high-quality dataset and using a hybrid tuning strategy, AgentTuning produces AgentLM models that achieve strong agent performance while maintaining general language capabilities. The open-sourced dataset and models aim to bridge the gap between open and commercial LLMs for agent tasks. Evaluations demonstrate AgentLM models exhibit impressive generalization, highlighting the potential of this approach to fundamentally improve agent abilities of LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents AgentTuning, a method to enhance the agent abilities of large language models (LLMs) like Llama while preserving their general capabilities. AgentTuning has two main components: 1) A dataset called AgentInstruct containing 1,866 high-quality interaction trajectories across 6 agent tasks, constructed via instruction generation, trajectory interaction using GPT-4, and trajectory filtering. 2) A hybrid instruction tuning strategy that mixes AgentInstruct trajectories with general domain instructions from ShareGPT at an empirically optimized ratio of 1:4. This tuning strategy is used to fine-tune the Llama 2 series, resulting in the AgentLM series of models. By combining agent-specific trajectories with general domain data, AgentTuning activates the agent capabilities of LLMs without compromising their general language abilities. Evaluations show AgentLM significantly outperforms the original Llama 2 on held-in and held-out tasks, while maintaining performance on general NLP benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization of agent skills. The AgentLM-70B model nearly matches GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on various unseen tasks.
