# [Understanding Community Bias Amplification in Graph Representation   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04883)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper discovers and analyzes the phenomenon of community bias amplification in graph representation learning, where structural biases between communities are exacerbated, leading to unfair performance differences between classes in downstream tasks. Through theoretical spectral analysis, the authors show how structural imbalances like varying node degrees can cause embedding distributions to have different levels of concentration across communities, harming model fairness. To mitigate this, they propose a random graph coarsening technique as data augmentation and design a novel graph contrastive learning model called RGCCL that contrasts the coarsened graph against the original. By coarsely clustering nodes, smoothing structural disparities, and using an appropriate contrastive loss, RGCCL is able to produce more balanced and higher-quality embeddings while improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate RGCCL's effectiveness at alleviating community bias amplification compared to existing methods. Theoretically-grounded and practical, the work provides useful insights into the causes of and solutions for unfairness originating from graph structure.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper discovers a phenomenon called "community bias amplification" in graph representation learning, which refers to the exacerbation of performance bias between different node classes when using graph neural networks. This happens because structural biases between communities with different connectivity lead to varying convergence speeds of node embeddings, causing an imbalance in embedding densities. This then leads to unfair classification performance between node classes in downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution:
1) The paper first provides a theoretical spectral analysis on the causes of community bias amplification from the perspective of local convergence properties. It shows how structural imbalances lead to varying eigenvalue gaps in normalized graph Laplacians, which translates to differences in convergence rates.

2) Based on the analysis, the paper proposes a data augmentation method called "random graph coarsening" to mitigate the issue. It proves that under certain constraints, contracting random edges in the graph can balance the embedding convergence across classes. A novel loss objective is designed to encourage embeddings of the original graph to be close to the cluster centroids in the coarsened graph.

3) Finally, the paper proposes the "Random Graph Coarsening Graph Contrastive Learning (RGCCL)" model which utilizes the random coarsening strategy along with a contrastive learning framework that compares the embeddings between the original graph and the coarsened graph. This forces node embeddings to become more balanced.

Main Contributions:
1) Discovering and analyzing the phenomenon of community bias amplification in graph neural networks from a theoretical spectral perspective.

2) Proposing random graph coarsening as an effective data augmentation technique for mitigating embedding fairness issues, with theoretical analysis.

3) Developing the novel RGCCL model for graph contrastive learning that leverages random graph coarsening to reduce performance bias between classes in downstream tasks.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrating RGCCL's ability to improve fairness and classification accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
