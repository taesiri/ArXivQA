# [Understanding Community Bias Amplification in Graph Representation   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04883)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper discovers and analyzes the phenomenon of community bias amplification in graph representation learning, where structural biases between communities are exacerbated, leading to unfair performance differences between classes in downstream tasks. Through theoretical spectral analysis, the authors show how structural imbalances like varying node degrees can cause embedding distributions to have different levels of concentration across communities, harming model fairness. To mitigate this, they propose a random graph coarsening technique as data augmentation and design a novel graph contrastive learning model called RGCCL that contrasts the coarsened graph against the original. By coarsely clustering nodes, smoothing structural disparities, and using an appropriate contrastive loss, RGCCL is able to produce more balanced and higher-quality embeddings while improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate RGCCL's effectiveness at alleviating community bias amplification compared to existing methods. Theoretically-grounded and practical, the work provides useful insights into the causes of and solutions for unfairness originating from graph structure.
