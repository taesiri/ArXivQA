# [Stateful Large Language Model Serving with Pensieve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems are stateless across requests and do not cache conversation history between requests. 
- In multi-turn conversations, each new request must provide the full conversation history, which leads to redundant and costly recomputation of the conversation history with each new request.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Pensieve, a stateful LLM serving system that maintains conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing.

Key Ideas:
- Multi-tier GPU-CPU caching strategy to store conversation history embeddings (KV-tokens) for reuse across requests. Recently used conversations cached in GPU, older conversations swapped to CPU.
- Handle scenarios when part of conversation history is swapped out from GPU cache by restoring from CPU cache or recomputing dropped history.  
- New multi-query attention GPU kernel to allow attention computation between new input tokens and conversation history KV-tokens scattered in non-contiguous GPU memory.

Main Contributions:
- Identify major inefficiency of stateless LLM serving systems in multi-turn conversation scenarios.
- Design a stateful serving system Pensieve optimized for multi-turn conversation serving using multi-tier caching.
- Develop new multi-query attention GPU kernel to support non-contiguous caches.
- Evaluation shows 1.5-2x higher throughput and 60-75% lower latency compared to stateless baseline.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of redundant computation in stateless LLM serving for multi-turn conversations, by designing a stateful serving system Pensieve that maintains conversation state across requests using multi-tier caching and a new multi-query attention GPU kernel. Key innovations include the multi-tier caching strategy and handling non-contiguous caches for efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces Pensieve, a stateful large language model serving system that caches conversation history in GPU and CPU memory to avoid redundant computation across requests in multi-turn dialogues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Identifying a major inefficiency in existing LLM serving systems for multi-turn conversations: the repeated recomputation of growing conversation history with each new request, instead of reusing previously processed context. 

2. Developing Pensieve, a stateful LLM serving system that saves conversation context in a multi-tier GPU-CPU cache and reuses it across requests to minimize redundant computation. The system design includes efficiently moving data between cache tiers and handling partially dropped context via recomputation.

3. Building a new GPU kernel to compute attention between a new request's multiple input tokens and the saved context scattered in non-contiguous GPU memory. Existing kernels either require contiguous context cache or restrict to a single input token.

4. Evaluating Pensieve on real-world conversation datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving serving throughput by 1.51-1.95x and reducing normalized latency by 60-75% compared to a state-of-the-art stateless serving system.

In summary, the main contribution is developing and evaluating Pensieve, a stateful serving system optimized for multi-turn conversations that minimizes redundant computation by caching and reusing conversation context across requests. A key component is the multi-query attention kernel that enables attending new input tokens to non-contiguous cached context.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a two-tier hierarchical caching strategy with GPU and CPU memory. What were the considerations in determining what data should be cached in GPU vs CPU memory? How does the system determine when to evict data from GPU to CPU?

2. The paper proposes a pipelined approach to overlap data transfer between GPU and CPU with computation. Can you explain in more detail how the pipelining works across multiple transformer layers? How is the data dependency between layers handled? 

3. The unified batch scheduling seems key to improving efficiency. Can you elaborate on the batch formation strategy across requests in different phases? How does the scheduler track and allocate GPU cache slots effectively?

4. The multi-query attention kernel is a key contribution. Can you explain the differences in computation pattern compared to the single-query attention kernel? How does it help unify and parallelize the initiation and generation phases? 

5. How does the system handle scenarios when part of the conversation history embeddings have been dropped due to CPU memory pressure? What is the policy for determining which parts of the context to drop?

6. How well does the proposed method scale to larger transformer models with more parameters and layers? What are the bottlenecks and how can the system be optimized further?

7. The paper focuses on optimizing for conversational scenarios. How well would this method apply to other application scenarios such as long document summarization or question answering?

8. What modifications would be needed to apply the proposed techniques in a distributed, multi-GPU environment? What are some unique challenges in that setting?

9. How could the method leverage other optimizations like quantization, speculative decoding etc. to further improve performance?

10. Beyond caching conversation history, what other strategies could help optimize multi-turn conversations, e.g. user input prediction, context refinement over multiple turns?
