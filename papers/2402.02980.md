 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control schemes for robotic manipulators. The key problem addressed is that faults and failures in robotic manipulators can lead to costly system breakdowns and safety issues across critical industries relying on them. To ensure reliability and continuity of operations, effective fault diagnosis and tolerance mechanisms are essential.

The paper traces the historical progress made in fault-tolerant control strategies, encompassing the transition from basic hardware redundancy concepts to advanced model-based methods and contemporary data-driven techniques. It highlights the pivotal role sensors play in enabling real-time system monitoring, fault detection, and feeding diagnostic data to fault-tolerant controllers.  

The paper emphasizes recent breakthroughs fueled by the integration of cutting-edge technologies - artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and digital twin technologies (DTT). It analyzes their transformative impact on enhancing fault diagnosis and tolerance capabilities. Real-world use cases across automotive manufacturing, medical robotics, space exploration and industrial logistics showcase successful implementations.

Key contributions include:
1) Reviewing state-of-the-art innovations in fault-tolerant control tailored for robotic manipulators 
2) Investigating the synergistic fusion of AI, ML and DTT in improving system reliability, adaptability and autonomous recovery
3) Exploring emerging trends like explainable AI and reinforcement learning for predictive maintenance and optimized fault mitigation
4) Highlighting challenges and future directions, including edge computing, quantum computing, human-machine collaboration and sustainability considerations.

Overall, the paper significantly contributes to the knowledge base guiding reliability-critical applications of robotic manipulators across domains by providing a unified perspective on the enabling role of AI, ML and DTT in fault diagnosis and tolerance.
