# [StarCoder: may the source be with you!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06161)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the main research focus is on developing large language models for code by training them on large datasets of source code. Some key aspects the paper investigates are:

- Curation and cleaning of a massive training dataset (1 trillion tokens) from permissively licensed code repositories. This includes selecting languages, filtering data, handling personal information, etc.

- Training methodology for the StarCoderBase and StarCoder models, which have 15.5 billion parameters. The models incorporate architectural features like 8k context length, fill-in-the-middle capabilities, and fast large-batch inference.

- Comprehensive evaluation of StarCoder against existing models on code tasks across over 80 programming languages. The models aim to achieve state-of-the-art performance on code generation, completion, and translation.

- Analysis of model capabilities on natural language tasks given the mixture of code and natural language training data.

- Steps towards safely releasing the models, including improvements to PII redaction, integrating attribution tools to detect training set copies, and using an Open Responsible AI license.

So in summary, the central research direction seems to be developing performant and responsible large language models for code through scaled-up model training and dataset curation. The paper aims to provide full transparency into this process and benchmark the capabilities of the resulting models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it looks like the main contribution of this paper is the release of StarCoder and StarCoderBase, which are 15.5B parameter code generation models trained on a large dataset of permissively licensed code called The Stack. Specifically:

- They trained StarCoderBase on 1 trillion tokens from 80+ programming languages, GitHub issues, Jupyter notebooks, etc. sourced from The Stack. 

- They then fine-tuned StarCoderBase on 35B additional Python tokens to create StarCoder.

- They performed extensive evaluations showing these models match or exceed the performance of previous state-of-the-art code generation models, including both open access models like CodeGen and closed models like OpenAI's code-cushman-001.

- They took steps towards safe and responsible model release by improving their PII detection pipeline, incorporating attribution tools to detect training set memorization, and releasing the models under an enhanced OpenRAIL license.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be the training, evaluation and responsible release of the new high-performing StarCoder code generation models. The paper provides full transparency into the model development process and demonstrates new state-of-the-art results on code generation.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more advanced techniques for PII detection and redaction. The authors note limitations of their current PII pipeline and suggest enhancing it with larger datasets, more robust models and post-processing rules.

- Improving the data consent and opt-out mechanisms. The paper discusses some limitations of the current opt-out approach used in The Stack dataset and proposes exploring opt-in consent as well as better ways to handle duplicated code from non-consenting authors. 

- Expanding community engagement and research. The authors recommend further qualitative studies and participatory design workshops with open source developers to better understand their perspectives on data usage and governance of large models.

- Broadening accessibility and evaluation of multilingual models. The authors note that StarCoder was only evaluated on English benchmarks and suggest evaluating performance on other languages. Making models accessible to non-English speakers is also cited.

- Developing more rigorous security evaluations. The paper points to the need for red teaming, adversarial testing, and safety layers to validate model robustness and mitigate potential misuse. Evaluating performance on additional security-focused benchmarks is also suggested.

- Carbon emissions reduction. Though emissions estimates are provided, the authors propose further optimizing training to minimize the carbon footprint.

- Economic impact studies. Assessing the effect of Code LLMs on the software engineering job market is mentioned as an area needing more research.

- Benchmarking evolving model capabilities. The authors emphasize the need for continued evaluation as models grow in scale and capability. Developing additional benchmarks that track progress is highlighted.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these directions! The authors lay out a thorough research agenda to ensure continued responsible open development of Code LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes StarCoder and StarCoderBase, two new open-access code LLMs with 15.5 billion parameters trained by the BigCode community. StarCoderBase was trained on 1 trillion tokens from 80+ programming languages, GitHub issues, commits, and notebooks from The Stack dataset. StarCoder is a version fine-tuned on 35 billion Python tokens. Both models have an 8K context length and support fill-in-the-middle for infilling tasks. The paper presents extensive evaluations showing these models match or exceed the performance of prior open and closed-access code LLMs on a diverse set of benchmarks. The models are released with an OpenRAIL-M license to enable broad access while restricting harmful use cases. The release includes new attribution tools and improvements to the PII redaction pipeline used for training. Overall, this work aims to advance the open, responsible development of capable code LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for training large language models (LLMs) that use multi-query attention (MQA) to enable fast training and evaluation with very long context lengths. The key idea behind MQA is to split the attention computation into multiple steps, where each step focuses on attending to a small chunk of the context. 

Specifically, the authors train a 15.5 billion parameter Transformer decoder model called StarCoder using MQA with a context length of 8,192 tokens. The model is first pre-trained on a diverse corpus totaling 1 trillion tokens, including source code in 80+ programming languages, GitHub issues, Git commit messages, and Jupyter notebooks. The pre-trained model, StarCoderBase, is then fine-tuned on 35 billion tokens of additional Python code. For efficient training, the authors use a combination of tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and data parallelism across 512 GPUs. The long context provided by MQA allows the model to condition on entire source code files during training. In evaluations, StarCoder outperforms previous code-generating models like CodeGen and matches proprietary models like GitHub Copilot, especially on complex programming tasks. The authors also implement novel attribution techniques to detect text copied from the training set and release the model publicly under an open license.
