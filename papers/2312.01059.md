# [Swarm-GPT: Combining Large Language Models with Safe Motion Planning for   Robot Choreography Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01059)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Drone swarm choreography design currently requires extensive manual effort and domain expertise, limiting accessibility for non-experts. 
- Existing automated approaches focus on mapping music features to motions but provide limited interactive feedback capabilities. 
- There is a need to bridge creativity and safety for real-world deployability.

Proposed Solution - Swarm-GPT:
- An automated drone swarm choreography pipeline that allows non-experts to generate synchronized drone performances through natural language instructions. 
- Integrates large language models (LLMs) with safe swarm motion planning algorithms.
- LLMs used to generate creative and unique swarm trajectories and formations based on musical prompts. 
- Model-based distributed planning algorithms used as a "safety filter" to ensure feasible and collision-free motions.
- Allows dynamic modification of trajectories through natural language re-prompting of LLM.
- Showcased in multiple live performances.

Key Contributions:
- Enables intuitive human-swarm interaction for choreography design using natural language, even for non-experts.
- Seamlessly integrates creativity of LLMs with safety guarantees of planning algorithms.
- Demonstrates first LLM-directed drone swarm control system with safe real-world deployment.
- Proof-of-concept system highlighting potential of LLM-based interfaces for robot coordination while ensuring safety.

In summary, the key innovation is combining the creative potential of large language models with the safety and effectiveness of planning algorithms to enable intuitive yet safe drone swarm choreography design and control by non-experts.
