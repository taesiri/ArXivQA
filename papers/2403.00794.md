# [Getting Serious about Humor: Crafting Humor Datasets with Unfunny Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Humor detection remains a challenging NLP task, limited by scarce datasets pairing humorous and non-humorous texts. 
- Recent advances in LLMs have not translated to reliable humor generation or detection abilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate if LLMs can generate synthetic humor data by editing jokes to "unfun" them. 
- Benchmark performance against human edits in existing Unfun corpus of edited Onion headlines.
- Extend approach to code-mixed English-Hindi humor tweets.

Contributions:  
- Show LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) outperform humans at unfunning headlines while struggling at humor generation.
- GPT-4 synthetic unfun data enables challenging classifiers and rated highly by annotators. 
- Unfunning ability generalizes to other languages like English-Hindi.
- New aligned datasets could support future humor detection and generation models.

In summary, the authors demonstrate LLMs have an asymmetrical capability for editing away versus generating humor. They harness this to create synthetic "unfun" versions of jokes to serve as challenging non-humorous counterparts. Benchmarking shows this data enables effective humor classifiers, and the approach generalizes across domains.
