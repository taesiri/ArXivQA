# [Getting Serious about Humor: Crafting Humor Datasets with Unfunny Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Humor detection remains a challenging NLP task, limited by scarce datasets pairing humorous and non-humorous texts. 
- Recent advances in LLMs have not translated to reliable humor generation or detection abilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate if LLMs can generate synthetic humor data by editing jokes to "unfun" them. 
- Benchmark performance against human edits in existing Unfun corpus of edited Onion headlines.
- Extend approach to code-mixed English-Hindi humor tweets.

Contributions:  
- Show LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) outperform humans at unfunning headlines while struggling at humor generation.
- GPT-4 synthetic unfun data enables challenging classifiers and rated highly by annotators. 
- Unfunning ability generalizes to other languages like English-Hindi.
- New aligned datasets could support future humor detection and generation models.

In summary, the authors demonstrate LLMs have an asymmetrical capability for editing away versus generating humor. They harness this to create synthetic "unfun" versions of jokes to serve as challenging non-humorous counterparts. Benchmarking shows this data enables effective humor classifiers, and the approach generalizes across domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates whether large language models can generate synthetic data for humor detection by editing texts to "unfun" existing jokes, finding that while current LLMs struggle to generate humor, they can outperform crowdworkers at removing humor to create aligned datasets of humorous and non-humorous texts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is investigating whether large language models (LLMs) can generate synthetic data for humor detection by editing existing texts to "unfun" them, removing humor while preserving other content. Specifically:

- The paper benchmarks LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 against human performance on the task of "unfunning" satirical headlines from the Unfun dataset. The authors find that current LLMs can outperform crowdworkers at reliably editing away humor while retaining meaning and coherence.

- The authors demonstrate that humor classifiers trained on GPT-4's synthetic "unfun" data can achieve high accuracy on classifying real satirical vs unfunned headlines, approaching performance with human-edited data. This suggests GPT-4's edits provide challenging and useful training data.

- The paper examines whether GPT-4's "unfunning" ability applies to other languages/domains by considering a corpus of English-Hindi code-mixed tweets. Human evaluation and classifier experiments indicate GPT-4 can reliably remove humor from tweets as judged by bilingual speakers.

In summary, the key contribution is showing LLMs' asymmetric humor abilities can be harnessed to automatically create humor detection datasets by unfunning existing jokes, rather than humor generation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Humor detection
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Synthetic data generation
- Unfun dataset
- Adversarial humor examples
- Evaluating humor abilities
- Editing away humor
- Code-mixed English-Hindi dataset
- Benchmarking LLMs
- Asymmetrical difficulty of humor

The paper explores using LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 to generate synthetic datasets by "unfunning" existing humorous texts, rather than trying to generate humor from scratch. It tests these models on the Unfun dataset and a English-Hindi Twitter dataset. The key findings are that while current LLMs struggle at humor generation, they can reliably edit away humor to create challenging datasets for humor detection. The paper also coins the term "asymmetrical difficulty" to describe how removing humor is an easier task for LLMs compared to creating it.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What motivated the authors to investigate language models' ability to "unfun" humor rather than generate humor? How does this connect to theories about the asymmetry in difficulty of certain language tasks?

2. Why does training humor classifiers on aligned pairs of humorous and unfunny texts help improve performance? What are the limitations of using unrelated non-humorous texts?

3. How did the automatic and human evaluations complement each other to provide a comprehensive assessment of the synthetic Unfun data quality? What are some of the challenges in evaluating humor generation systems?

4. The authors tested both chat and completion models for unfunning. What are the tradeoffs between these two types of models for conditional text generation? Which appeared more suitable for this task?

5. The simple RoBERTa token swap baseline performed surprisingly well according to some metrics. What does this suggest about the role of surprise and incongruity in humor? How could this method be improved?

6. For what reasons might current LLMs struggle at humor generation, despite their strong language modeling capabilities? How could future work address these limitations?

7. Why did the authors choose a code-mixed English-Hindi Twitter dataset for testing cross-lingual generalization? What new challenges did this data present over the English satirical headlines?

8. How consistently could the synthetic Unfun data trick humor classifiers when incorporated into training sets? What does this imply about the quality and difficulty of the data?

9. What steps did the authors take to prevent data contamination issues from impacting the benchmarking results? How prevalent was model memorization of training pairs?

10. What are some of the key ethical considerations and limitations related to research on computational humor generation? How could the authorsâ€™ unfunning approach potentially be misused?
