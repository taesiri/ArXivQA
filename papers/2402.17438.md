# [V2C-Long: Longitudinal Cortex Reconstruction with Spatiotemporal   Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17438)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Longitudinal MRI analysis is important to study within-subject brain changes over time, like in aging, disease progression, or treatment response. 
- Existing cortical surface reconstruction methods from MRI either lack inherent correspondence between surfaces (cross-sectional methods like TopoFit, CF++, V2C-Flow, V2CC) or provide inconsistent meshes over time (FreeSurfer longitudinal pipeline).
- This lack of spatiotemporal consistency hinders sensitive downstream analysis, like cortical thickness changes in Alzheimer's disease.

Proposed Solution - V2C-Long:
- Two-stage deep learning approach 
    1) Create within-subject surface template by computing median of vertices from longitudinal V2C-Flow or V2CC surfaces 
    2) Deform enriched template to target scan with second neural deformation network
- Establishes strong inherent spatiotemporal correspondence, i.e. matching vertices across surfaces of one subject and between subjects
- Runtime under one minute on GPU

Main Contributions:
- First dedicated deep learning method for longitudinal cortical surface reconstruction
- Significantly improves consistency compared to state-of-the-art cross-sectional and longitudinal methods
- Enables direct group analysis, i.e. without surface registration or inflation
- More sensitive detection of regional cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease patients
- Fast processing time allows application in large studies

In summary, V2C-Long advances cortical surface reconstruction for longitudinal MRI analysis by leveraging recent progress in deep learning to establish unprecedented spatiotemporal surface correspondence. This will benefit a wide range of neuroimaging studies investigating within-subject brain changes over time.
