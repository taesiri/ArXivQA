# [6D Assembly Pose Estimation by Point Cloud Registration for Robot   Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02593)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an assembly pose estimation method to enable precise object placement for robotic manipulation and assembly tasks. The approach utilizes RGB-D input and 3D CAD models to estimate the 6D pose of an object that satisfies assembly constraints relative to other objects. It consists of a semantic segmentation module to detect objects, followed by iterative point cloud registration between local target point clouds from the scene and source point clouds derived from CAD models. By estimating the transformation aligning the source to the target point clouds after each assembly step, the method can accumulate relative poses between objects and output the final assembly pose. Evaluations on simulated gear assembly datasets demonstrate sufficiently accurate estimated poses according to metrics based on point cloud alignment quality, vertex distances, and surface distances. A demonstration on estimating poses of engine rocker arms highlights applicability for industrial use cases, although performance depends on amount of visible surfaces. By avoiding exhaustive computations or model view sampling as in prior arts, the proposed approach enables precise assembly without compromising efficiency.
