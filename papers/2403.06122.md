# [Style Blind Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation via Covariance   Alignment and Semantic Consistence Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06122)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic datasets like GTAV do not generalize well to real-world datasets like Cityscapes due to domain shift. This is mainly caused by variations in visual styles (textures, illumination, image quality) across datasets. Existing methods either use domain randomization or feature normalization, but both have limitations - randomization requires additional datasets while normalization removes some semantic content.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes BlindNet - a domain generalization approach for semantic segmentation that works by "blinding the style" to extract robust features, without needing external datasets or modules. It has two key components:

1) Covariance Alignment in Encoder: Uses two losses - Covariance Matching Loss (CML) to align covariance matrices of original and augmented image features to handle style variations; Cross-Covariance Loss (CCL) to encode consistent content by matching diagonals of cross-covariance matrices.

2) Semantic Consistency Contrastive Learning in Decoder: Has two contrastive losses to construct a robust embedding space - Class-wise Contrastive Loss (CWCL) to distinguish between segmentation classes; Semantic Disentanglement Contrastive Loss (SDCL) to disentangle easily confused classes.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes covariance alignment to mitigate style variations while preserving content information for domain generalization in encoder

- Introduces semantic consistency contrastive learning in decoder to learn discriminative embeddings and disentangle confusing classes

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen domains like Cityscapes, BDD100K, Mapillary without needing external datasets or changing network architecture

- Ablation studies demonstrate the efficacy of each proposed loss function in enhancing domain generalization ability

The main advantage of BlindNet is achieving domain generalization for semantic segmentation without additional resources, by intrinsic feature learning using covariance statistics and contrastive learning.
