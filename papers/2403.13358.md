# [GeRM: A Generalist Robotic Model with Mixture-of-experts for Quadruped   Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13358)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quadruped robots have potential for diverse tasks but collecting expert demonstration data is costly and performance is limited by quality of demonstrations. 
- Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on imitation learning from demonstrations which has limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose GeRM (Generalist Robotic Model), a VLA model based on Transformer decoder with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure.
- Use offline reinforcement learning to optimize data utilization - learn from both demonstrations and sub-optimal failed data.
- MoE structure increases model capacity while keeping computational cost low by only activating a subset of parameters per token.

Key Contributions:
- Propose first MoE model for quadruped RL, validated over 99 tasks. Outperforms prior methods by 30-70%.
- Demonstrate GeRM efficiency - converges faster than baselines. Emerges novel skills like dynamic path planning.
- Contribute QUARD-Auto dataset with 258418 auto-collected trajectories on 5 tasks to enable learning from sub-optimal data.

In summary, the paper introduces a new paradigm for quadruped learning - leaning from mixed-quality data with MoE to achieve an efficient yet high-capacity generalist model that can acquire skills beyond demonstrations. The auto-collected dataset also reduces data collection costs.
