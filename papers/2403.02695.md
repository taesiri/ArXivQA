# [Controllable Prompt Tuning For Balancing Group Distributional Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Controllable Prompt Tuning For Balancing Group Distributional Robustness":

Problem:
Models trained on datasets composed of different groups can suffer from severe performance degradation when tested on out-of-distribution data. Prior methods like Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO) focus on optimizing the worst-group loss, which often comes at the expense of good overall performance. GroupDRO is also susceptible to overfitting over time. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces Controllable Prompt Tuning (CPT), an optimization scheme to achieve good model performance across groups without severely sacrificing accuracy on any group. CPT draws inspiration from multi-objective optimization to determine an update direction benefiting all groups simultaneously. It maximizes the entropy over the distribution of group losses to balance learning. 

CPT allows controlling the trade-off between groups via a vector c to adjust the relative importance of group losses. To scale CPT efficiently with multiple c vectors, the method leverages prompt tuning to only update a small subset of parameters per task.

Main Contributions:
- A novel balancing mechanism based on multi-objective optimization to address challenges in group distributional robustness. Considers all groups jointly instead of the worst group only.

- Introduces a controllable vector c to dynamically adjust priorities across groups, improving flexibility over prior work.

- Integrates prompt tuning techniques to update only a small portion of parameters, enhancing scalability for multiple c vectors and enabling debiasing of large transformer models.

- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance on Waterbirds, CelebA, MetaShift and ISIC datasets. Surpasses prior work in debiasing Vision Transformers and CLIP while updating only 0.4% of parameters.

In summary, CPT is an efficient and flexible approach to balance model performance across groups and prevent learning of spurious correlations. The method combines multi-objective optimization with prompt tuning for scalability across transformer architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Controllable Prompt Tuning (CPT), a method that leverages prompt tuning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing model accuracy across groups and preventing models from learning spurious correlations, while requiring minimal trainable parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a novel balancing mechanism to address the challenges of group distributional robustness. The method not only considers the worst group but also leverages the gradient information from all groups to determine an ultimate updating direction that benefits all of them.

2. Extending the method by introducing a controlling vector that allows dynamically adjusting the priority across groups. This enables controlling the trade-off between group performance.

3. Integrating prompt tuning techniques to enhance the scalability of the method as the complexity and number of controlling vectors increase. This makes the method applicable for de-biasing large transformers-based models.

4. Conducting extensive experiments on benchmark datasets where the proposed method (Controllable Prompt Tuning or CPT) consistently exhibits superior performance. CPT surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on the Waterbirds and CelebA datasets while updating only 0.4% of parameters. It also outperforms recently proposed methods that aim to de-bias Vision Transformer and CLIP models with minimal training cost.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an optimization scheme called CPT that can achieve good performance across groups without severely sacrificing performance on any individual group. CPT also has advantages in terms of efficiency and flexibility thanks to prompting techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Group distributional robustness - The paper aims to develop models that perform effectively across different groups in the data to avoid learning spurious correlations.

- Worst group performance - One evaluation metric is the worst (minimum) test accuracy across groups. The goal is to improve this worst group performance.  

- Balancing mechanism - The paper proposes a balancing mechanism during training to optimize loss magnitudes across groups simultaneously rather than focusing on just the worst group.

- Controlling vector - A vector is introduced to adjust the priority or focus on different groups during training by controlling the magnitude of group losses.

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) - Prompt tuning techniques are integrated to enable efficiently tuning the large models and scaling the approach to multiple controlling vectors.

- Pareto optimality - Concepts from multi-objective optimization theory are leveraged, such as finding Pareto optimal solutions that balance tradeoffs between groups.

- Vision transformers - Experiments show the method applied to debias Vision Transformer (ViT) and CLIP models for image classification.

So in summary, the key ideas focus on balancing performance across groups in the data to avoid spurious correlations and unintended biases, using efficient prompt tuning methods.
