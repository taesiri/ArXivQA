# [GlORIE-SLAM: Globally Optimized RGB-only Implicit Encoding Point Cloud   SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advancements in dense RGB-only simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) predominantly utilize neural implicit encodings like neural radiance fields. However, these methods struggle with efficiently realizing global map and camera pose consistency. Explicit scene representations like point clouds can deform to account for global bundle adjustments and loop closures, but have not been explored in RGB-only settings. Further, the lack of geometric priors in RGB-only settings makes tracking and mapping more challenging.

Method:
The paper proposes an efficient RGB-only dense SLAM system using a flexible neural point cloud to represent the scene. This point cloud adapts to updates in camera poses and depth without needing costly backpropagation. To alleviate lack of geometry, a novel Disparity, Scale and Pose Optimization (DSPO) layer is introduced. It combines pose and depth estimation for keyframes with scale and depth refinement using a monocular depth prior. This aids in reconstruction completeness and accuracy. The system benefits from loop closure detection and online global bundle adjustment to maintain global consistency. 

Contributions:
- RGB-only SLAM framework with neural point cloud scene representation that allows online map deformations for loop closures and bundle adjustments
- Novel DSPO layer that couples monocular depth prior into bundle adjustment by splitting optimization and using it to regularize inaccurate keyframe depth while keeping accurate keyframe depth fixed
- Integrates loop closure and online global bundle adjustment for tracking robustness
- Achieves state-of-the-art rendering accuracy and competitive tracking and mapping accuracy on Replica, TUM-RGBD and ScanNet datasets

The main novelty is the use of a deformable neural point cloud in an RGB-only setting along with a technique to effectively utilize a monocular depth prior for increased mapping completeness and accuracy.
