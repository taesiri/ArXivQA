# [ITCMA: A Generative Agent Based on a Computational Consciousness   Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in tasks requiring implicit instructions and common-sense knowledge, often needing multiple tries to achieve human-level performance. This can lead to inaccurate responses or inferences in practical environments, affecting consistency.

- Existing LLM agent architectures have limitations in memory usage and extracting relevant information as interaction cycles grow, making it difficult to maintain context and continuity.

Solution:
- The paper proposes the Internal Time-Consciousness Machine (ITCM), a computational structure imitating consciousness to enhance LLM agents' ability to handle complex tasks. 

- The ITCM incorporates concepts like the perceptual field, phenomenal field, consciousness channel (with retention, primal impression, protention), memory triggering, emotions, needs, and drive to simulate a stream of consciousness.

- Based on the ITCM, an ITCM agent (ITCMA) is introduced that takes perception as input and generates actions as output using an LLM, with the ITCM guiding behavior generation.

Contributions:
- Introduces ITCM computational consciousness structure to enhance intelligence, interpretability and consistency of LLM-based agents.

- Validates ITCMA effectiveness in text and real robotic environments, showing superior utility and continual evolution ability over baselines.

- Untrained ITCMA also achieves high task completion, indicating flexibility and generalization capability for complex tasks.

- Proposes a structure for simulating consciousness to optimize LLM-based agents, providing a pathway for more human-like artificial general intelligence.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in using a computational consciousness approach to improve task performance of LLM agents across diverse environments.
