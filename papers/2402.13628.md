# [Improving Building Temperature Forecasting: A Data-driven Approach with   System Scenario Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13628)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for about 40% of energy usage in buildings. Effective HVAC management can significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. However, modeling and predicting room temperature for large-scale HVAC control is challenging due to the complexity of building thermodynamics. Existing physics-based and machine learning methods have limitations in generalization, computational efficiency, accuracy and interpretability. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a data-driven room temperature prediction method based on system scenario clustering. It first extracts time series features and uses k-means to cluster historical data into distinct system scenarios representing different HVAC operating characteristics. For each cluster, it trains an interpretable symbolic regression model to capture long-term and short-term temperature dependencies. At runtime, new data is assigned to the closest cluster and uses the corresponding model for 1-day ahead prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces system scenario concept to HVAC modeling to improve generalization and simplify large-scale management 
- Applies feature-based clustering to classify distinct operating characteristics in historical data
- Uses symbolic regression for scenario-specific modeling to provide accuracy and interpretability 
- Achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by 33%
- Demonstrates the approach on real-world HVAC system data for both cooling and heating operation

In summary, the paper presents a novel data-driven HVAC modeling approach to improve temperature prediction accuracy, training efficiency and interpretability by using system scenario clustering and symbolic regression. Experiments on real data validate the benefits over existing methods.
