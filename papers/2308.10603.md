# [A step towards understanding why classification helps regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10603)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: Why does adding a classification loss to a regression loss help improve performance on regression tasks? The authors note that it is a common practice in computer vision to add a classification loss to a regression loss when training deep models, even though intuitively the regression targets contain more information than the classification labels. They want to understand in what cases and why adding this classification loss is beneficial.To investigate this, the authors start with controlled experiments on synthetic 1D data, testing different data variations like noisy data, out-of-distribution data, and imbalanced sampling. They empirically find that the classification loss has the biggest impact when the training data is imbalanced. They then try to explain these results theoretically by formalizing the relation between the balanced and imbalanced regression losses. Their analysis suggests that the classification loss helps deal with the extra error term that arises from the imbalanced sampling.Finally, they validate their findings on real-world imbalanced image datasets for depth and age estimation, and for video progress prediction. The consistent improvements from adding classification loss on the imbalanced real datasets confirm their hypothesis that this practice is most useful when the training data is imbalanced.In summary, the central research question is about understanding why classification helps regression, which the authors address through controlled experiments and theoretical analysis, showing the particular benefits for imbalanced data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is an analysis of why adding a classification loss can help improve regression performance in deep learning models. The key points are:- The paper empirically tests on controlled 1D synthetic data when adding a classification loss helps regression, finding the most benefit for imbalanced data sampling.- The paper provides a theoretical analysis to explain these empirical observations, formalizing the connection between imbalanced regression and using both regression and classification losses. - The paper validates the findings on real-world imbalanced datasets for depth estimation, age estimation, and video progress prediction, showing classification helps in these imbalanced regression tasks.- Overall, the paper takes a step towards understanding why classification helps regression, with the main takeaway being that for imbalanced regression tasks, adding a classification loss can improve results. The analysis helps explain the common practice of using classification losses for regression in computer vision.In summary, the paper provides both empirical analysis and theoretical grounding to understand the benefits of adding classification losses to regression, especially for the case of imbalanced data sampling which is common in real-world tasks. The insights help explain and guide a commonly used technique in computer vision.
