# [Improved prediction of future user activity in online A/B testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03231)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of predicting future user activity in online A/B testing experiments. Specifically, the goals are to predict (1) the number of new users that will trigger/participate in the experiment in future time periods, and (2) the rate at which both new and existing users will trigger/re-trigger in the experiment over time. Accurate predictions on these metrics can help experimenters determine optimal experiment durations and improve estimates of treatment effects.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Bayesian nonparametric model called the negative binomial scaled stable process (NBP) for making these predictions. The NBP models user trigger rates as draws from an underlying prior distribution called a scaled stable process. It assumes user trigger counts follow a negative binomial distribution conditioned on the drawn rates. This flexible approach avoids restrictive parametric assumptions. The authors derive closed-form posterior distributions that enable direct prediction of future user counts and rates without MCMC sampling.

Key Contributions:

- Introduction of the NBP to predict future user activity in A/B testing, establishing a connection between Bayesian nonparametrics and causal experiment design.

- Closed-form posterior characterization that yields simple predictors for number of new users and their re-trigger rates in future periods. Enables scalable predictions without MCMC.  

- Superior empirical performance over competing methods on proprietary and public A/B testing data sets. Especially effective in predicting total future user activity compared to alternatives.

- Comprehensive model description, theoretical results, predictive accuracy assessments, and model fitting details to enable uptake and extensions by other researchers.

Overall the paper makes both methodological and applied contributions in connecting Bayesian nonparametric methodology to an important causal inference problem of predicting future sample sizes and activity rates in online experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a Bayesian nonparametric approach for predicting the rate at which individuals will be exposed to interventions in online A/B testing experiments, offering dual prediction capabilities for both the quantity of new customers expected in future time windows and the number of times they will be observed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the abstract, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel, straightforward, and scalable Bayesian nonparametric approach for predicting the rate at which individuals will be exposed to interventions within the realm of online A/B testing. The paper introduces this method and shows that it offers dual prediction capabilities - it forecasts both the quantity of new customers expected in future time windows and, unlike other methods, the number of times they will reappear. The authors derive closed-form expressions for the posterior distributions needed to make these predictions, avoiding the need for numerical methods like MCMC. They then demonstrate the superior performance of their proposed approach over existing methods on both simulated and real-world A/B testing data.

In summary, the key novelty is a scalable Bayesian nonparametric method for making more accurate predictions about future user activity rates in online experiments, with particular advantages over current approaches.

The paper introduces a Bayesian nonparametric approach based on the negative binomial process and stable-beta scaled process to predict future user activity and re-trigger rates in the context of online A/B testing experiments. It provides posterior and predictive characterizations for this model, and uses these to derive estimators for predicting the number of new users as well as their total activity levels in future time periods. The goal is to help experimenters determine optimal duration of A/B tests.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a Bayesian nonparametric approach for predicting future user activity in online A/B testing. How is the Bayesian nonparametric approach used here different from traditional parametric Bayesian models? What are the advantages of using a nonparametric approach?

2) The paper assumes an infinite number of potential users that could trigger in the experiment. What is the motivation behind this modeling assumption and how does it help circumvent challenges with specifying an upper bound on the number of users?

3) The negative binomial distribution is used in the likelihood modeling. What properties of the negative binomial distribution make it a good choice for modeling the re-trigger counts data? How would using a different distribution impact the modeling?

4) The stable-beta scaled process (SBSP) is used as the prior on the random measure Î˜. Explain the construction of the SBSP prior and why it is a suitable choice of prior for this application.

5) Derive the posterior characterization results provided in Propositions 1-3. Explain how these results enable scalable posterior inference without needing MCMC sampling algorithms. 

6) How are the predictors for the number of new users (Proposition 4) and new users with a given frequency (Proposition 5) derived from the posterior distribution? Explain the steps to obtain these predictive distributions.

7) The empirical Bayes approach is used for fitting the hyperparameters. Compare the maximum marginal likelihood and regression-based methods for hyperparameter tuning. When would each approach be preferred?

8) Explain the sampling scheme provided to generate synthetic data from the proposed model (Section 3.4). How do the conditional representations help make this sampling process straightforward?

9) How do the predictors derived from this model for the total number of new users and total re-trigger rates help experimenters determine optimal experiment duration?

10) Suggest some ways the modeling approach proposed here could be extended, for example to incorporate covariates or to allow time-varying parameters. What methodology could enable these extensions?
