# [Artificial Intelligence for Literature Reviews: Opportunities and   Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Artificial Intelligence for Literature Reviews: Opportunities and Challenges":

Problem:
Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a rigorous methodology for assessing and integrating prior research on a topic, but they are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Many tools have been developed to support SLRs, with some incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, but prior surveys have not sufficiently examined the AI capabilities of these tools.

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of AI usage in 21 leading SLR tools, focusing specifically on the screening and extraction phases. The authors evaluate the tools across 34 features, including 11 AI-specific features such as approach, input data, minimum requirements for training, and pre/post-screening support functionalities. They also discuss 11 additional emerging tools leveraging large language models to aid literature search and academic writing.

Key Findings:
- 12 tools can be used across research fields, while 9 target biomedicine specifically
- 15 tools use AI to classify relevant papers; 4 tools extract info or assess bias
- Most common AI approaches are SVMs, logistic regression, neural networks
- Data representations rely on BoW, word/sentence embeddings 
- Minimum labeled data needed ranges from 1 to 30 documents
- 8 tools offer advanced pre-screening support like topic modeling or PICO tagging
- Only 2 tools provide post-screening abilities like summarization

Main Contributions:
- In-depth analysis of AI integration in 21 SLR tools using a framework with 34 features 
- Identification of limitations of current tools, including outdated methods, lack of interpretability, limited benchmarking
- Outlining of key research challenges regarding advanced AI, evaluation, usability 
- Overview of 11 emerging LLM-based tools aiding literature search and writing
- Discussion of trends and future directions in AI for literature reviews
