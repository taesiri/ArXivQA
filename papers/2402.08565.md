# [Artificial Intelligence for Literature Reviews: Opportunities and   Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Artificial Intelligence for Literature Reviews: Opportunities and Challenges":

Problem:
Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a rigorous methodology for assessing and integrating prior research on a topic, but they are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Many tools have been developed to support SLRs, with some incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, but prior surveys have not sufficiently examined the AI capabilities of these tools.

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of AI usage in 21 leading SLR tools, focusing specifically on the screening and extraction phases. The authors evaluate the tools across 34 features, including 11 AI-specific features such as approach, input data, minimum requirements for training, and pre/post-screening support functionalities. They also discuss 11 additional emerging tools leveraging large language models to aid literature search and academic writing.

Key Findings:
- 12 tools can be used across research fields, while 9 target biomedicine specifically
- 15 tools use AI to classify relevant papers; 4 tools extract info or assess bias
- Most common AI approaches are SVMs, logistic regression, neural networks
- Data representations rely on BoW, word/sentence embeddings 
- Minimum labeled data needed ranges from 1 to 30 documents
- 8 tools offer advanced pre-screening support like topic modeling or PICO tagging
- Only 2 tools provide post-screening abilities like summarization

Main Contributions:
- In-depth analysis of AI integration in 21 SLR tools using a framework with 34 features 
- Identification of limitations of current tools, including outdated methods, lack of interpretability, limited benchmarking
- Outlining of key research challenges regarding advanced AI, evaluation, usability 
- Overview of 11 emerging LLM-based tools aiding literature search and writing
- Discussion of trends and future directions in AI for literature reviews


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of tools that incorporate artificial intelligence to support systematic literature reviews (SLRs). The key contributions are:

1) It performs an extensive evaluation of 21 leading SLR tools according to 34 features, with a focus on 11 AI-specific features. This provides a detailed examination of the AI techniques used in these tools to semi-automate SLR tasks. 

2) It offers a critical discussion of the tools' capabilities, limitations, and suitability for different use cases. This aims to provide guidance for researchers in selecting appropriate tools.

3) It identifies and discusses major research challenges and opportunities for advancing AI support in SLRs. This includes integrating large language models, enhancing interpretability, leveraging knowledge graphs and semantics, improving benchmarks and evaluation frameworks.

4) It examines 11 additional emerging tools based on large language models that can aid literature search, screening, extraction and writing. Although not designed explicitly for SLRs, their capabilities can potentially be integrated into future SLR tools.

In summary, this paper provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of AI for SLRs, while also laying out an insightful research agenda to further this field. The thorough examination of existing tools and the future outlook offer valuable insights both for developers and users of such AI-powered systems.
