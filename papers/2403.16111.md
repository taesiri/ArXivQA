# [EVA: Zero-shot Accurate Attributes and Multi-Object Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16111)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current diffusion-based video editing methods struggle with accurately editing multiple attributes simultaneously while preserving the original video's layout and motion. The key issues are:
1) Inaccurate text-to-attribute control, failing to precisely align text embeddings with corresponding visual regions.  
2) Attention leakage across attributes, causing texture blending.
3) Inability to extend to multi-object editing with identity mapping.

Proposed Solution - EVA:
The authors propose EVA, a zero-shot multi-attribute video editing framework for human-centric videos. The key ideas are:  

1) Spatial-Temporal Layout-Guided Attention (ST-Layout Attn) mechanism that leverages intrinsic positive/negative correspondences in cross-frame diffusion features to enhance attention for tokens in the same attribute and reduce it for tokens across attributes.

2) Discrete text embeddings focused on layout areas in the cross-attention layer for accurate text-to-attribute control.

3) Decoupling object motion and identity by using human poses as sparse motion guidance.

Main Contributions:
1) ST-Layout Attn mechanism for precise attention weighting to avoid leakage.

2) Achieving accurate text-to-attribute control via discrete embeddings aligned to layouts.  

3) Extending to multi-object editing with identity mapping by precise attention distribution.

4) State-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and real-world videos without any parameter tuning.

In summary, EVA introduces an effective attention mechanism for diffusion models to achieve precise multi-attribute and multi-object video editing while preserving layout and motion.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes EVA, a framework for multi-attribute and multi-object video editing that introduces a Spatial-Temporal Layout-Guided Attention mechanism to achieve precise text-to-attribute control and avoid attention leakage between attributes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes EVA, a general framework for accurate attributes and multi-object video editing, which realizes accurate weight distribution and identity mapping.

2. It introduces a Spatial-Temporal Layout-Guided Attention (ST-Layout Attn) mechanism that leverages the intrinsic positive and negative correspondences of cross-frame diffusion features. This allows for accurate text-to-attribute control and avoids attention leakage. 

3. The ST-Layout Attn ensures each text embedding focuses on its respective attribute, enhances coherence within attributes, and keeps exclusivity of attention weights among different attributes.

4. Benefiting from the precise attention weighting, EVA can be easily extended to multi-object editing scenarios and achieves accurate identity mapping.

5. Extensive experiments demonstrate EVA achieves state-of-the-art results on existing benchmarks and real-world videos, both qualitatively and quantitatively, without tuning any parameters.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the EVA framework and ST-Layout Attention mechanism for precise multi-attribute and multi-object video editing in a zero-shot manner.
