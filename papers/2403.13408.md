# [S2DM: Sector-Shaped Diffusion Models for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Diffusion models have shown promising results for image generation, but adapting them to video generation poses significant challenges in maintaining consistency and continuity across frames. 
- Main issues are the lack of effective frameworks to align frames with desired temporal features while preserving consistent semantic and stochastic features.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel Sector-Shaped Diffusion Model (S2DM) where a sector-shaped diffusion region is formed by ray-shaped reverse diffusion processes starting from the same noise point. 
- This generates a group of related data sharing semantic and stochastic features but varying in temporal features under guidance of conditions.
- Apply S2DM to video generation using text descriptions as semantic guidance and optical flow as temporal guidance. 
- Also propose a two-stage strategy for text-to-video generation, generating temporal conditions in the first stage to guide video generation in the second stage.

Main Contributions:
- Identify 3 key aspects for high-quality video generation: ensuring semantic/content consistency, uniform stochastic details across frames, and aligning frame differences with temporal features.
- Propose the S2DM framework to maintain shared semantic/stochastic features and incorporate temporal guidance.
- Achieve strong quantitative and qualitative results for conditional video generation, outperforming existing methods.
- Demonstrate generalizable two-stage strategy for text-to-video generation without needing temporal supervision.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective S2DM framework for consistent high-quality video generation guided by semantic and temporal conditions, with very promising results on human action and facial expression datasets.
