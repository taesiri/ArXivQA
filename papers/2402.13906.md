# [Leveraging Collection-Wide Similarities for Unsupervised Document   Structure Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13906)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Document collections often share some latent structure that captures useful information about typical properties of documents in that collection. This structure can aid both human users and structure-aware models. 
- However, automatically extracting this typical document structure is challenging because:
  - Headers that mark the same topic often differ in wording across documents 
  - Some headers are unique to individual documents and do not reflect the collection-level structure
  - Order of topics can vary across documents

Proposed Solution:
- Represent the document collection as a complete undirected weighted graph 
  - Nodes are topic boundary candidates (headers) from all documents
  - Edge weights capture semantic similarity between nodes via header text, body text and position similarities
- Apply community detection to find groups of topically similar headers across the collection
- Filter communities to keep only the k topics that maximize coverage across the collection 
- The resulting k topics form the collection-wide Table of Contents (ToC)
- Map the ToC topics back to text spans in individual documents 

Main Contributions:
- Formal task definition for extracting typical document structure from a collection
- Curated 3 diverse datasets spanning different domains and languages
- Developed unsupervised graph-based method that uses both inter- and intra-document similarities to extract meaningful collection-wide structure
- Showed the approach works across domains and languages with no supervision
- Analysis indicates the method captures correct document structure but can struggle with exact topic boundaries

The method and data are released to support future work on leveraging document structure for tasks like retrieval and summarization across document collections.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an unsupervised graph-based method to extract the typical document structure from a collection of documents by leveraging both inter- and intra-document similarities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Formally defining a new task of identifying the typical document structure from a collection of documents. This requires capturing recurring topics across the collection, abstracting over arbitrary header paraphrases, and grounding the topics to document locations.

2) Curating three datasets from diverse domains (financial, legal) and languages (English, Hebrew) to evaluate the task.

3) Developing an unsupervised graph-based approach that represents the document collection as a weighted graph. It then uses community detection to identify coherent topics and ground them to documents.

4) Evaluating the approach on the three datasets using metrics like header intrusion, document grounding, and qualitative analysis. The evaluations show that the method is able to extract meaningful structure across domains and languages.

In summary, the key contribution is defining the novel task, curating suitable datasets, and developing and evaluating an unsupervised learning approach to extract the typical document structure from a collection.

The paper presents an unsupervised graph-based method to identify the typical document structure within a collection of documents by leveraging both inter- and intra-document similarities. It extracts a collection-wide table of contents (TOC) to represent the prominent topics across the documents while abstracting over header paraphrases. The method is evaluated on financial and legal document datasets in English and Hebrew. Overall, the key focus is on unsupervised extraction of document structure for collections of documents sharing an underlying structure.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an unsupervised graph-based method to extract typical document structure from a collection. What are the key challenges this method aims to address compared to previous supervised approaches? How does modeling collection-wide similarities help address these challenges?

2. The paper represents the document collection as a complete undirected weighted graph. What do the nodes and edges in this graph represent? How is the edge weight calculated based on different similarity metrics?

3. Community detection is applied on the collection graph to identify coherent topics. Explain the rationale behind using the Louvain algorithm for community detection. What objective function does it optimize and how does that relate to extracting a meaningful collection-wide structure?

4. The paper filters communities from the graph based on coverage maximization. Explain this process. Why is coverage an appropriate metric to use for identifying the most prominent topics across the collection? 

5. The paper evaluates the extracted structure using header intrusion, document grounding metrics and qualitative analysis. Compare and contrast these three evaluation approaches. What aspects of the method do they aim to evaluate?

6. Analyze the header intrusion results across the three datasets. Why does the method achieve higher accuracy on the 10-K dataset compared to the other two? What does this indicate about the robustness of the approach?

7. The exact match score for document grounding is low compared to partial match. What are some reasons attributed to this gap? How could the grounding be improved to boost exact match?

8. During error analysis, the paper finds confusion between opposite headers like "defense arguments" and "prosecution arguments". Why does this happen? How can semantic similarities between such opposite topics be modeled better?

9. The paper maps the extracted 10-K ToC to the gold ToC. Analyze this mapping - what alignments and discrepancies do you observe? What enhancements could make the ToC prediction match closer to gold?

10. The paper currently only outputs a flat topic list. How can the approach be extended to output hierarchical document structure if present? What changes would be needed in graph construction and community detection?
