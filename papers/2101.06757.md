# [Higher Order Automatic Differentiation of Higher Order Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06757)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of the paper seem to be:1. Providing a denotational semantics for a higher order language with variants and inductive types (like lists) using diffeological spaces. This semantics guarantees that all definable functions are smooth (infinitely differentiable).2. Defining a syntactic forward-mode automatic differentiation translation on the language that can compute higher order derivatives.3. Proving the correctness of the automatic differentiation translation with respect to the denotational semantics using a logical relations argument. This shows the differentiation translation computes mathematically correct derivatives. 4. Giving a categorical analysis of the correctness argument in terms of syntactic categories and a "gluing" construction on diffeological spaces.5. Extending the correctness result to all first order types using manifolds and jet bundles from differential geometry.6. Providing a discussion about the non-uniqueness of derivatives for higher order functions in this framework and relating it to notions of derivatives studied in differential geometry.In summary, the main contribution seems to be providing a denotational semantics for differentiable programming languages that supports correctness proofs for automatic differentiation, including at higher types. The categorical analysis and connections to differential geometry also seem novel.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents semantic correctness proofs of automatic differentiation methods on a higher order language with algebraic data types, using diffeological spaces to model smoothness and a gluing construction to simultaneously interpret programs and their derivatives.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the abstract, here are a few ways this paper relates to other research on automatic differentiation:- It provides semantic correctness proofs for automatic differentiation methods, especially focusing on higher order methods that compute higher derivatives. This adds to existing work that studies verification of AD from an operational semantics perspective.- It uses diffeological spaces as the model to interpret the programming language and prove correctness. This provides a denotational semantics approach to reasoning about smoothness and derivatives. Other recent work has used more traditional models like manifolds. - It proposes a new "gluing" construction to model relations between programs and their derivatives. This helps resolve issues around defining derivatives of higher order functions. The gluing idea seems related to other categorical treatments of logical relations.- It aims to handle a language with higher order functions and algebraic data types. Extending AD to these language features has been an active research direction. Related papers have studied linear type systems or reverse mode AD on functional languages.- For higher derivatives, it connects to mathematical work on Taylor approximations and jet bundles. This makes contact with "Taylor mode AD" methods used in some implementations.Overall, the paper seems to blend semantic/categorical techniques with practical language considerations relevant to AD. It makes theoretical contributions around modeling derivatives, especially at higher types, while keeping implications for real AD tools in view. Situating the work among other AD research, those seem like some of its notable features. But I'd be interested to hear others' more expert takes!
