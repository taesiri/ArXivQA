# [MedPromptX: Grounded Multimodal Prompting for Chest X-ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Chest x-rays are commonly used to predict cardiopulmonary conditions, but efforts to integrate them with patient clinical data in EHRs face challenges due to incomplete records.  
- Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive. Using few-shot learning requires careful design of prompts and selection of examples to avoid poor performance.  
- Detecting abnormalities in chest x-rays remains an area for improvement in terms of precision.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces MedPromptX, the first model to combine multimodal LLMs, few-shot prompting and visual grounding for chest x-ray diagnosis.
- It addresses incomplete EHRs by complementing missing information using a pre-trained multimodal LLM.
- It proposes a dynamic proximity selection (DPS) technique to refine few-shot examples based on their similarity to the query case. 
- It incorporates visual grounding to focus attention on relevant image regions.

Main Contributions:
- Mitigates missing EHR data by transforming inputs into text and leveraging pre-trained MLLMs
- Extracts logical patterns from few-shot data efficiently using proposed DPS technique
- Constructs new in-context visual question answering dataset, MedPromptX-VQA
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving F1 score by 11% over baselines

In summary, MedPromptX is a novel multimodal diagnostic model that integrates few-shot learning, language models and visual grounding to enhance prediction of chest x-ray abnormalities by effectively incorporating incomplete clinical text and imagery.
