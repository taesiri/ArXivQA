# [Arabic Synonym BERT-based Adversarial Examples for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text classification systems are vulnerable to adversarial text attacks which are small perturbations to input text that cause misclassification, while being mostly unnoticeable to humans.  
- Prior work on adversarial text attacks focused on English and character-level attacks in Arabic. No prior work examined word-level attacks in Arabic.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the first study of word-level adversarial attacks in Arabic using a synonym replacement strategy. 
- They use a BERT model's masked language modeling capability to predict plausible synonyms for words in Arabic text. The replaced words are checked for grammar and meaning preservation.
- The attack is black-box, where the model internals are not accessible. Three target models are attacked: fine-tuned BERT, WordCNN and WordLSTM.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art Arabic text classifiers are susceptible to the proposed BERT-based synonym attack, with fine-tuned BERT being most vulnerable.
- Human evaluation by native Arabic speakers shows the attacks produce adversarials that are 88-98% grammatically correct and preserve 86-89% semantic similarity on average.  
- Study attack transferrability between models and find fine-tuned BERT has highest transferrability as a victim model.
- Show that adversarial training helps regain 2% accuracy for BERT models, demonstrating it as a starting point for defense.

In summary, the paper presents the first automated word-level adversarial attack in Arabic using BERT, evaluates its impact extensively, and sets up baseline defense mechanisms against such attacks.
