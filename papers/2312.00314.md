# [A bilevel optimal motion planning (BOMP) model with application to   autonomous parking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00314)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a bilevel optimal motion planning (BOMP) model for autonomous vehicle trajectory generation and optimization. The upper level optimizes the vehicle dynamics as an optimal control problem, while the lower level uses a linear programming method called the $J_2$-function to enforce collision avoidance constraints between polygonal approximations of the vehicle and obstacles. A key contribution is using the modified approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (MAKKT) conditions to transform the complex bilevel program into a more standard nonlinear programming problem. Further speedups come from a two-stage algorithm that uses different versions of the $J_2$-function: first a modified version generates an approximate collision-free trajectory, then an active-point version sharpens the solution. Simulations demonstrate the BOMP model plans optimal parking trajectories 2-3 times faster than baseline methods. Physical experiments also show the approach allows a TurtleBot robot to navigate tightly packed obstacles. In summary, the paper offers a new optimal planning framework with strong empirical performance improvements versus alternatives.
