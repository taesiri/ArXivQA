# [A bilevel optimal motion planning (BOMP) model with application to   autonomous parking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00314)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a bilevel optimal motion planning (BOMP) model for autonomous vehicle trajectory generation and optimization. The upper level optimizes the vehicle dynamics as an optimal control problem, while the lower level uses a linear programming method called the $J_2$-function to enforce collision avoidance constraints between polygonal approximations of the vehicle and obstacles. A key contribution is using the modified approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (MAKKT) conditions to transform the complex bilevel program into a more standard nonlinear programming problem. Further speedups come from a two-stage algorithm that uses different versions of the $J_2$-function: first a modified version generates an approximate collision-free trajectory, then an active-point version sharpens the solution. Simulations demonstrate the BOMP model plans optimal parking trajectories 2-3 times faster than baseline methods. Physical experiments also show the approach allows a TurtleBot robot to navigate tightly packed obstacles. In summary, the paper offers a new optimal planning framework with strong empirical performance improvements versus alternatives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a bilevel optimal motion planning model that combines nonlinear optimal control for vehicle dynamics with linear programming collision avoidance constraints, enabling efficient high-precision motion planning for autonomous vehicles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It proposes a new bilevel optimal motion planning (BOMP) model that combines optimal control for robot dynamics (upper level) with a linear programming collision avoidance method ($J_2$-function) as a constraint (lower level). This allows optimal control to be applied efficiently for complex, high-precision motion planning problems.

2. It develops a solution approach using a modified approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (MAKKT) theory to transform the problematic bilevel model into a traditional optimal control problem. An iterative two-stage algorithm is proposed using a modified $J_2$-function (MJ) initially and an active points based modified $J_2$-function (APMJ) in the final stage for faster performance.

3. It demonstrates the efficiency of the BOMP model and algorithm through simulations of autonomous parking scenarios and an experiment with a Turtlebot3 robot. Results show the computation time is reduced by almost two orders of magnitude compared to using an area criterion collision avoidance method.

In summary, the key contribution is the development of the BOMP framework that unifies optimal control and efficient linear programming collision checking to enable fast, high-precision motion planning for complex environments and robot dynamics. The two-stage solution algorithm and experimental validations also demonstrate the efficiency of this approach.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating optimal and collision-free trajectories for autonomous vehicles/robots moving in complex environments is challenging. Two key constraints are: 1) Robot dynamics constraints, 2) Collision avoidance with obstacles.  
- Traditional methods have limitations in handling complex geometries precisely or being computationally efficient.

Proposed Solution:
- A bilevel optimal motion planning (BOMP) model is proposed. The upper level optimizes for robot dynamics while the lower level handles collision avoidance constraints.
- The lower level uses a linear programming based J2-function to precisely check collisions between convex polyhedrons. This allows approximating complex shapes efficiently.
- The BOMP problem is transformed into a single level problem using a modified Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approach to address its difficulty. 
- To improve efficiency further, a two stage algorithm is introduced leveraging a Modified J2 (MJ) function and an Active Point based MJ (APMJ) function.

Main Contributions:
- BOMP combines the flexibility of optimal control methods for robot dynamics with the simplicity and precision of J2-function for collision avoidance.
- It can handle problems with high complexity and precision with superior computational speed.
- The two-stage algorithm with MJ and APMJ functions and an iterative convergence strategy significantly improves computation speed.
- Simulations for autonomous parking and experiment with a Turtlebot validate the precision, speed and general applicability of BOMP over other approaches.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel bilevel optimization model and efficient algorithm for robotic motion planning addressing key limitations of existing approaches. The results showcase its ability to provide fast, precise and optimal trajectories even in complex environments.
