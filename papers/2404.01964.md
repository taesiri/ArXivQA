# [CAM-Based Methods Can See through Walls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01964)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Class Activation Maps (CAM) based methods like GradCAM are popular techniques to explain CNN image classifiers by highlighting important regions in the input image through saliency maps. 
- These methods use global coefficients to weight the activation maps from the convolutional layers, which can be problematic.
- The paper shows both theoretically and experimentally that these methods can highlight pixels that are not actually used by the subsequent layers of the network for making predictions. So they highlight "unseen" regions and are unreliable.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors first theoretically analyze GradCAM applied to a simple CNN model with masked weights, showing that GradCAM highlights unseen regions, even at initialization.
- They then train a VGG-like network on ImageNet with weights masked to create an unseen "dead zone" in the lower part of images.
- Two new datasets are created with composite images having one subject in the seen zone and one in the unseen zone.
- Multiple CAM methods are tested on these datasets and shown to highlight the unseen zone. Only HiResCAM does not have this problem.

Main Contributions:
- Formal analysis showing CAM methods can highlight unseen regions in theory
- Training a real CNN with weights masked to create an unseen zone
- Quantitative evaluation of CAM methods on new datasets with unseen zones, showing most highlight these
- Demonstrating that only HiResCAM does not suffer from this, due to using element-wise coefficients 

The key insight is that global coefficients used in CAM methods can unfortunately highlight activations that are unseen by subsequent layers, a surprising phenomenon that is shown rigorously both theoretically and with novel experiments.
