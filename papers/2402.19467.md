# [TV-TREES: Multimodal Entailment Trees for Neuro-Symbolic Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video question answering (VideoQA) over complex multimodal content like TV clips is challenging. Existing video-language models have issues with long inputs, lack interpretabiliy, and rely on single-modality reasoning rather than joint reasoning. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes TV-TREES, the first multimodal entailment tree generator for video understanding. 
- It produces trees showing entailment relationships between simple "atomic" premises directly entailed by video frames and dialogue, and higher-level conclusions that answer VideoQA questions. 
- This provides transparent and interpretable joint reasoning across modalities.

Key Contributions:
1) TV-TREES system that produces multimodal entailment trees to explain video understanding through logical reasoning steps. First of its kind.
2) Formulation of multimodal entailment tree generation task and metrics to evaluate step-by-step reasoning quality. 
3) Experiments show TV-TREES achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on TVQA using full video clips, demonstrating effectiveness.
4) Qualitative analysis shows trees provide interpretable reasoning chains, contrasting black-box models.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic approach to multimodal video understanding that generates transparent entailment trees while maintaining high QA accuracy. This interpretable joint reasoning is a key contribution over existing opaque videoQA models.
