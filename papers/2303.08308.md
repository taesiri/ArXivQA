# [SpaceEvo: Hardware-Friendly Search Space Design for Efficient INT8   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08308)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we automatically design a hardware-friendly search space for efficient INT8 inference that produces neural network models with high accuracy and low latency on real-world edge devices?

The key hypothesis is that directly applying NAS (neural architecture search) with existing manually designed search spaces leads to poor performance for INT8 quantized models on edge devices. This is due to the diverse quantization efficiency of different operators and configurations, as well as hardware-specific preferences. 

To address this, the authors propose a method called SpaceEvo to automatically design specialized quantization-friendly search spaces for target hardware. The goal is to discover hardware-preferred operators and configurations to construct the search space, guided by a metric called Q-T score that quantifies how quantization-friendly a search space is. This allows NAS to find larger and superior quantized models that achieve both high accuracy and low INT8 latency for efficient deployment.

In summary, the paper aims to address the limitations of using existing NAS techniques and search spaces directly for finding efficient quantized models, by automatically designing hardware-aware quantization-friendly search spaces. The key hypothesis is that this approach will produce models with better accuracy-latency trade-offs on real devices compared to prior NAS methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors conduct an in-depth analysis to understand the factors that impact INT8 quantized latency on real-world edge devices. They find that both operator type and configurations (e.g. channel width) can greatly affect INT8 latency. They also find that quantization-friendly settings vary across devices. 

2. Motivated by their analysis, the authors propose SpaceEvo, a novel method to automatically design specialized quantization-friendly search spaces for NAS on different hardware devices. The key idea is to search for hardware-preferred operators and configurations to construct the search space.

3. The authors introduce several techniques to enable efficient search of quantization-friendly search spaces: (a) Q-T score to evaluate search space quality; (b) Elastic stages to simplify the search space; (c) Block-wise quantization to reduce search cost.

4. Extensive experiments show that the automatically designed search spaces consistently outperform manually designed search spaces, leading to new state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy under latency constraints on two hardware platforms. The discovered models also achieve much better INT8 speedups compared to baseline models.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of SpaceEvo, an automated and efficient method to design specialized quantization-friendly search spaces for different hardware. This allows NAS to find superior INT8 quantized models that achieve high accuracy under latency constraints on real devices. The techniques introduced also enable efficient search space design at low cost.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes SeqNet, an automatic method to design hardware-friendly search spaces for efficient INT8 inference that can discover models with higher accuracy under latency constraints compared to prior manually designed spaces.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new method called SpaceEvo for designing hardware-friendly search spaces to enable efficient deployment of INT8 quantized neural networks. Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related works:

- Most prior work has focused on quantization-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to find efficient INT8 models, but still uses manually designed search spaces like MobileNet that are not optimized for quantization latency on diverse hardware. This paper is the first to propose automatically designing a specialized quantization-friendly search space for each hardware device.

- The paper identifies that both operator type and channel width configurations significantly impact INT8 latency, but these factors are not jointly optimized in prior NAS search spaces. SpaceEvo evolves the search space on both these dimensions to find hardware-optimized blocks and configurations.

- Existing methods like NSE and AutoFormer focus on searching for higher accuracy, not quantization efficiency. SpaceEvo is the first lightweight approach to automatically generate a search space for quantization by proposing innovations like block-wise quantization to enable rapid search.

- Experiments show models found by SpaceEvo consistently surpass state-of-the-art efficient models and quantization-aware NAS methods. The models achieve higher accuracy and lower latency after INT8 quantization on real hardware like Intel CPUs and mobile devices.

- SpaceEvo provides useful design guidelines and insights about differences in optimal quantization-friendly operators and channel configurations across hardware platforms through an extensive empirical study.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to enabling efficient deep learning deployment through hardware-aware neural architecture search. It is the first work to automatically generate high-quality quantization-optimized search spaces tailored to diverse hardware constraints.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more advanced search algorithms for search space optimization. The authors used aging evolution in this work, but suggest exploring more advanced search algorithms like reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization. This could further improve search efficiency and quality.

- Generalizing the search space optimization framework to other hardware efficiency objectives besides quantization latency, like energy usage or memory footprint. The core ideas of defining an optimization metric to guide search and using blockwise training for efficiency may extend to other objectives.

- Applying the search space optimization framework to other model types besides convolutional neural networks, like transformers or graph neural networks. This may require adapting the elastic block and hyperspace encoding, but could help these other model types achieve optimized efficiency.

- Conducting studies across more edge devices to build a comprehensive understanding of quantization behavior and hardware differences. The authors studied two devices in this work, but expanding to more edge hardware can help build more generalized and robust search spaces.

- Extending the approach to support extremely low precision quantization like 4-bit or lower. The paper focused on 8-bit quantization but lower precision is an important future direction as it can provide further efficiency gains. The blockwise training scheme may need adjustment to handle the accuracy challenges of lower precision.

- Combining optimized search space discovery with techniques like knowledge distillation to further improve accuracy. Knowledge distillation holds promise for recovering accuracy losses from quantization, and integrating it with the search pipeline is an interesting direction.

In general, the authors' framework provides a strong foundation, and an exciting future direction is expanding it to handle more diverse models, hardware, and efficiency constraints. The opportunities forSearch Space Evolution forEfficient 8bit Inference


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents SeqNet, a method for automatically designing efficient INT8 quantized neural networks (QNNs) that achieve low latency on real-world devices. The key idea is to automatically search for a quantization-friendly search space for each target hardware device, rather than relying on a single large search space. This is because the paper finds that operator choices and configurations greatly impact INT8 latency on different devices, so a specialized search space is needed for each hardware target. The method, called SpaceEvo, uses an evolutionary algorithm to search for hardware-optimized elastic stages, guided by a proposed Q-T score to measure search space quality. To reduce the prohibitive search cost, a blockwise quantization scheme is introduced to build an accuracy lookup table. Experiments on ImageNet classification demonstrate that SpaceEvo consistently finds superior search spaces compared to prior manually designed spaces, enabling discovered models (SeqNet) to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs under INT8 quantization on real devices. The specialized search spaces can produce tiny yet accurate models, and allow larger models that better utilize INT8 optimizations, surpassing existing quantization-aware NAS methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes SeqNet, a new method for designing efficient INT8 quantized neural networks (QNNs) for edge devices. The key idea is to automatically search for a quantization-friendly search space that enables neural architecture search (NAS) methods to find QNN models with high accuracy and low latency. The authors observe that choices of operators and configurations in standard NAS spaces lead to diverse quantization efficiency on hardware, limiting the effectiveness of NAS for INT8 deployment. To address this, SeqNet introduces a novel search algorithm called SpaceEvo that evolves a specialized search space for each hardware target. SpaceEvo is guided by a proposed metric called Q-T score that measures the quantization friendliness of subnets in the search space. To make SpaceEvo practical, a blockwise quantization scheme is proposed to reduce the prohibitive cost of evaluating candidate search spaces. Once SpaceEvo finds an optimal search space, NAS methods can be used to train a quantized-for-all supernet and search for high-accuracy low-latency QNNs.

Experiments demonstrate SpaceEvo consistently finds superior quantization-friendly search spaces compared to standard manually-designed spaces. The resulting SeqNet models achieve state-of-the-art INT8 accuracy on ImageNet under various latency constraints. For example, SeqNet establishes a new SOTA accuracy of 80.0% on ImageNet with only 24.4ms latency on a CPU, outperforming prior QNNs like FBNetV3-A. Moreover, tiny SeqNet models surpass lightweight models like ShuffleNetV2 0.5 with over 10% higher accuracy at 4.3ms. Overall, by automatically designing quantization-friendly search spaces, SeqNet enables NAS to produce QNNs with exceptional accuracy and hardware efficiency.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes SpaceEvo, a method to automatically design hardware-friendly search spaces for efficient INT8 inference. The key idea is to use an evolutionary algorithm to search for quantization-friendly operators and configurations to construct a specialized search space for each target hardware device. The evolution is guided by a proposed metric called Q-T score that quantifies how quantization-friendly a candidate search space is, measured by the accuracy and latency trade-offs of top-performing subnetworks. To make the search tractable, the method introduces the concept of "elastic stages" to represent a search space by a sequence of stages with flexible operator types and configurations. It also employs a block-wise quantization scheme to rapidly estimate the quantized accuracy of subnets using precomputed block-level losses. Once the optimized search space is obtained, a quantized-for-all supernet is trained over it, and evolutionary search is used to derive Pareto-optimal quantized models. Experiments demonstrate superior accuracy and latency trade-offs compared to manually designed search spaces.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to design hardware-friendly and efficient quantized neural networks that can achieve high accuracy and low latency when deployed on real-world edge devices. 

Specifically, the paper points out that prior methods for neural architecture search (NAS) and quantization often optimize for FLOPs or FP32 latency as a proxy for efficiency, but these metrics do not accurately reflect the true latency of quantized networks on edge devices. As a result, models found through typical NAS have poor latency performance when quantized and deployed.

The paper proposes a new automated method called SpaceEvo to address this issue. The key ideas are:

1) Design specialized quantization-friendly search spaces for each target hardware that contain operators and configurations preferred by that hardware. This allows NAS to find models that better optimize for quantization efficiency on that device.

2) Define a new metric called Q-T score to guide the search towards spaces that produce high accuracy, low latency quantized models. 

3) Use an evolutionary search method to efficiently explore the vast space of possible search spaces and hardware-specific configurations.

4) Employ a block-wise quantization scheme to rapidly estimate quantized accuracy during the search and reduce overall search costs.

Through this automated approach, the goal is to eliminate the gap between model design and hardware optimizations, allowing NAS to directly produce state-of-the-art quantized models specialized for the deployment hardware. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and latency over prior NAS methods.
