# [An Empirical Study of End-to-End Video-Language Transformers with Masked   Visual Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01540)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: What design of masked visual modeling (MVM) is effective in the context of video-language (VidL) pre-training? 

The authors base their study on an end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET) model and investigate a broad spectrum of MVM targets to see which ones improve performance on downstream VidL tasks. The targets explored include RGB pixel values, histogram of oriented gradients, depth maps, optical flow, discrete visual tokens, spatial-focused image features, temporal-aware video features, and multimodal features. 

Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, the authors aim to gain insights into the factors that lead to effective MVM training for VidL learning. Their goal is to find the best MVM recipe to improve the VIOLET model's capabilities on various VidL benchmarks like video question answering, video captioning, and text-to-video retrieval.

In summary, the central research question is focused on understanding what makes for an effective MVM objective in the context of VidL pre-training, with the aim of improving performance on downstream VidL tasks. The authors systematically study different MVM variants on top of an end-to-end VidL transformer to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents an empirical study of masked visual modeling (MVM) for video-language pre-training. The authors explore 8 different targets for MVM, ranging from low-level pixel values to high-level visual features, and analyze their effectiveness for downstream video-language tasks. 

2. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, the paper provides insights into effective MVM training strategies and factors that lead to performance improvements. For example, the authors find that spatial-focused image features (SIF) extracted from an image classification model work best as MVM targets for video-text inputs.

3. The authors propose an enhanced video-language transformer model called VIOLETv2 that incorporates the most effective MVM strategies identified in their study. VIOLETv2 achieves strong performance on 13 video-language benchmarks covering tasks like video QA, retrieval, and captioning.

4. In comparisons to models pre-trained on the same 5M dataset, VIOLETv2 shows average gains of +5.4% on video QA, +6.6% on retrieval, and +11.4 CIDEr on captioning. It also outperforms the prior VIOLET model substantially even when using less pre-training data.

- The study encompasses a broad range of MVM targets including low-level pixels/gradients as well as high-level visual semantics from image classifiers or discrete VAEs. It provides insights into which targets are most effective for video-text pre-training.

- The paper also analyzes different MVM masking strategies and ratios specifically for video inputs. This extends common practices in language modeling like BERT to the video modality.

- Compared to the most related prior work VIOLET, this paper demonstrates significantly improved performance by identifying better MVM settings. The enhanced model VIOLETv2 outperforms VIOLET even when using much less pre-training data.

- The comprehensive analysis and strong empirical results on multiple VidL benchmarks advance our understanding of how to effectively conduct self-supervised modeling on the visual modality to improve video-language representations.

In summary, this paper provides novel insights into masked visual modeling tailored for video-language pre-training, through rigorous examination of various MVM objectives, strategies, and model architectures.

- Studying how MVM generalizes to larger-scale pre-training data. The paper's experiments used a relatively small pre-training dataset, so scaling up could reveal new insights.

- Exploring better MVM target choices as video/VidL foundation models emerge. The paper hypothesizes that with larger models, better target choices may become feasible. 

- Extending the model to handle full-length videos with dense frame sampling, to enable tasks like precise temporal localization.

- Incorporating additional modalities like audio or ASR transcripts to further enhance the model's capabilities.

- Generalizing the model to new VidL tasks beyond the ones studied in the paper, such as video grounded dialog.

- Analyzing how different downstream video lengths impact the effectiveness of MVM targets.

- Studying whether similar MVM strategies could benefit other cross-modal domains like audio-text learning.

In summary, the main future directions are scaling up pre-training, exploring new modalities and tasks, improving MVM designs, and analyzing how factors like video length affect MVM effectiveness. Advancing research in these areas could further unlock the potential of MVM for video-language learning.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a comprehensive empirical study on masked visual modeling (MVM) strategies for video-language pre-training. The key highlights are:

The study is based on an end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET) model that takes raw video frames as input and allows backpropagation to the pixel space. This enables exploring various MVM targets ranging from low-level pixels to high-level semantics during pre-training. 

They explore 8 different MVM targets including RGB values, HOG, depth maps, optical flow, discrete visual tokens, spatial image features, temporal video features, and CLIP multimodal features.

Through controlled experiments on WebVid dataset, they find spatial-focused image features (SIF) from Swin transformers lead to best downstream performance on TGIF-Frame QA (+0.7%) and DiDeMo retrieval (+5.8% AveR). 

Analyses reveal combining MVM targets is not effective, attended masking hurts performance, and blockwise masking helps circumvent reliance on neighbour patches. SIF works best on videos while pixels preserve image-text performance.

The improved model VIOLETv2 with optimal MVM outperforms VIOLET on 13 VidL datasets, especially +3.4% on QA and +8.6% R1 on retrieval, despite using 37x less pre-training data.

In summary, the paper presents a thorough empirical study to reveal effective MVM strategies for video-language pre-training, leading to state-of-the-art results on various VidL benchmarks.
