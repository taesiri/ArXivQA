# [An Empirical Study of End-to-End Video-Language Transformers with Masked   Visual Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01540)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: What design of masked visual modeling (MVM) is effective in the context of video-language (VidL) pre-training? The authors base their study on an end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET) model and investigate a broad spectrum of MVM targets to see which ones improve performance on downstream VidL tasks. The targets explored include RGB pixel values, histogram of oriented gradients, depth maps, optical flow, discrete visual tokens, spatial-focused image features, temporal-aware video features, and multimodal features. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, the authors aim to gain insights into the factors that lead to effective MVM training for VidL learning. Their goal is to find the best MVM recipe to improve the VIOLET model's capabilities on various VidL benchmarks like video question answering, video captioning, and text-to-video retrieval.In summary, the central research question is focused on understanding what makes for an effective MVM objective in the context of VidL pre-training, with the aim of improving performance on downstream VidL tasks. The authors systematically study different MVM variants on top of an end-to-end VidL transformer to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It presents an empirical study of masked visual modeling (MVM) for video-language pre-training. The authors explore 8 different targets for MVM, ranging from low-level pixel values to high-level visual features, and analyze their effectiveness for downstream video-language tasks. 2. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, the paper provides insights into effective MVM training strategies and factors that lead to performance improvements. For example, the authors find that spatial-focused image features (SIF) extracted from an image classification model work best as MVM targets for video-text inputs.3. The authors propose an enhanced video-language transformer model called VIOLETv2 that incorporates the most effective MVM strategies identified in their study. VIOLETv2 achieves strong performance on 13 video-language benchmarks covering tasks like video QA, retrieval, and captioning.4. In comparisons to models pre-trained on the same 5M dataset, VIOLETv2 shows average gains of +5.4% on video QA, +6.6% on retrieval, and +11.4 CIDEr on captioning. It also outperforms the prior VIOLET model substantially even when using less pre-training data.In summary, the core contribution is a comprehensive empirical study to understand and improve masked visual modeling for video-language pre-training, leading to the VIOLETv2 model that achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. The analyses provide practical insights into designing effective MVM strategies in this setting.
