# [RSCNet: Dynamic CSI Compression for Cloud-based WiFi Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04888)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- WiFi sensing using Channel State Information (CSI) is emerging for human activity recognition and other sensing tasks. However, resource-constrained IoT devices at the edge cannot perform complex deep learning based sensing locally. Transmitting raw CSI to the cloud incurs huge communication overhead. 

- Existing works do not address the joint problem of compressing CSI to reduce transmission overhead while retaining sensing accuracy. Works like SenseFi perform sensing on compressed CSI but do not reconstruct original CSI. Other works focus only on CSI compression.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel framework called RSCNet that addresses both CSI compression and sensing by jointly optimizing two loss functions related to activity classification and CSI reconstruction.

- RSCNet has an encoder at the edge device to compress CSI windows containing a few frames. The compressed representation is transmitted to the cloud server having a decoder and classifier.

- The decoder reconstructs original CSI from the compressed version while the classifier leverages recurrent LSTM units to accumulate temporal information across CSI windows for improved sensing.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates CSI windowing enables real-time sensing with reduced communication overhead compared to fixed duration sampling.

- Incorporates recurrent blocks to exploit temporal continuity in CSI windows which enhances both compression and sensing accuracy.

- Introduces a flexible decoder design providing a trade-off between reconstruction error and computational complexity. Evaluations show increasing decoder expansion rate from 1 to 5 reduces error by 0.84 dB at the cost of 9 times higher FLOPs.

- Achieves 97.4% activity classification accuracy with CSI compressed by a factor of 90, demonstrating robust performance across various compression ratios. Peak accuracy of 97.2% obtained using 50 frame CSI windows.

In summary, RSCNet facilitates efficient edge-cloud based WiFi sensing by transmitting highly compressed CSI without compromising sensing accuracy. The dual optimization approach also allows reconstructed CSI to be logged at the cloud server.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes RSCNet, a novel deep learning framework for real-time cloud-based WiFi sensing that jointly optimizes channel state information (CSI) compression at the edge and human activity recognition (HAR) in the cloud while reconstructing the original CSI with minimal loss.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents RSCNet, a novel network architecture designed specifically for real-time cloud-based Wi-Fi sensing for human activity recognition (HAR). The network enables joint CSI compression at the edge and sensing & CSI reconstruction in the cloud.

2) It demonstrates the significance of window-based CSI compression, resulting in efficient real-time HAR with reduced communication overheads compared to traditional fixed duration sampling. 

3) It incorporates LSTM-based recurrent blocks to leverage the time-series representation of CSI windows, improving both compression and human activity classification.

4) Through experiments on the UT-HAR dataset, it shows that RSCNet achieves a peak HAR accuracy of 97.2% and reconstruction NMSE of -22.759 dB under a compression ratio of 1/90 for a window size of 50 frames. It maintains robust performance across compression ratios.

5) It provides a computational analysis showing the trade-off between reconstruction error, HAR accuracy, communication overhead and computational complexity that can be tuned based on the application requirements.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel RSCNet architecture for joint real-time CSI compression and WiFi sensing along with an analysis of its performance under different configurations.
