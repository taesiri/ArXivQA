## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Simulated environments can greatly benefit UAS development by providing a controlled testing ground to validate navigation algorithms before real-world deployment. However, creating highly realistic simulations of actual environments is challenging. 
- Recently, Google's Cesium Tiles framework has provided access to extremely detailed 3D models of real-world locations, offering new potential for UAS simulation. But technical hurdles exist in leveraging this data, including geometry caching, format, and accessibility issues.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop techniques to control Cesium Tiles geometry caching to enable analysis of large 3D scenes needed for UAS simulations.
- Extract accurate geometry/appearance data from Cesium Tiles environments to serve as "ground truth" models.  
- Conduct real UAS flights and reproduce them in simulation using Cesium Tiles environments of the same locations.
- Compare mapping algorithm performance on real and simulated flights to quantify how well simulations predict real-world results.

Contributions:
- Indirect control of Cesium Tile caching by manipulating cine-camera viewpoint to ensure all required geometry is loaded.
- Extraction of large scale voxel models from Cesium environments using AirSim's simCreateVoxelGrid() function.  
- Reproduction of real UAS stadium flight in AirSim simulation using Cesium Tiles model of the area.
- Evaluation of Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) algorithm on real and simulated flights shows strong correlation in map point statistics, indicating simulated environments can accurately predict real-world mapping performance.

Impact:
- Findings enable expansive virtual testing of UAS systems at specific locations to develop customized solutions before real-world deployment. Simulated environments created with Cesium Tiles can serve as accurate digital twins for robust experimentation and algorithm tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes techniques to leverage realistic 3D simulation environments enabled by Google's Cesium Tiles to reproduce real-world unmanned aerial system experiments and quantitatively compares mapping algorithm performance between the simulated and real-world flights to show the simulation results accurately predict real-world outcomes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A technical approach for controlling the Cesium Tiles plugin geometry caching to allow for large-scale 3D geometry analysis and sensing required for extracting volumetric (octree) models of the Cesium Tiles environment.

2) An approach to reproduce a real-world experiment in simulation using the AirSim open-source simulator with the Cesium Tiles plugin. 

3) A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of how the algorithm results in the simulated environment compared with real-world experiments at the same location. 

The key findings are that the Cesium Tiles environments can provide highly accurate models of ground truth geometry after careful alignment, and that the virtual simulation results accurately predict real-life results for mapping algorithms like Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO). This indicates that Cesium Tiles environments can be used as effective virtual digital twins for real-life robotics experiments to get representative algorithm performance results.
