# [A revision on Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods for Multi-UAV   Mission Planning Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In multi-UAV mission planning, optimization algorithms return many optimal but different solutions. Selecting the most suitable plan is difficult and time-consuming for operators.  
- Operator preferences over mission objectives are often fuzzy (e.g. linguistic terms like "high importance"), so fuzzy methods are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- A decision support system (DSS) is proposed with two components: 
   1) Ranking module: Ranks solutions using fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and operator preference profiles. 
   2) Filtering module: Removes very similar solutions using a similarity function and threshold.

Methods:  
- Fuzzy MCDM methods (Fuzzy AHP, Fuzzy VIKOR, Fuzzy TOPSIS, Fuzzy MultiMOORA, Fuzzy WASPAS) are compared.
- Expert UAV operators evaluate solutions for different mission scenarios and profiles. Fuzzy VIKOR performs best.
- Filtering module uses a planning distance function between assignments of UAVs, tasks, etc. Threshold tunes removal of similar solutions.

Contributions:
- Comprehensive comparison of fuzzy MCDM methods for multi-UAV mission planning. Fuzzy VIKOR selected as most suitable.
- Novel planning distance function to detect similar solutions based on CSP model of problem.  
- Threshold analysis for filtering module balances number of solutions and quality.
- Reduces operator workload by ranking and filtering optimal mission plans for selection.
- Framework can be extended, e.g. by updating profiles based on final selections.
