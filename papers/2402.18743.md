# [A revision on Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods for Multi-UAV   Mission Planning Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In multi-UAV mission planning, optimization algorithms return many optimal but different solutions. Selecting the most suitable plan is difficult and time-consuming for operators.  
- Operator preferences over mission objectives are often fuzzy (e.g. linguistic terms like "high importance"), so fuzzy methods are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- A decision support system (DSS) is proposed with two components: 
   1) Ranking module: Ranks solutions using fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and operator preference profiles. 
   2) Filtering module: Removes very similar solutions using a similarity function and threshold.

Methods:  
- Fuzzy MCDM methods (Fuzzy AHP, Fuzzy VIKOR, Fuzzy TOPSIS, Fuzzy MultiMOORA, Fuzzy WASPAS) are compared.
- Expert UAV operators evaluate solutions for different mission scenarios and profiles. Fuzzy VIKOR performs best.
- Filtering module uses a planning distance function between assignments of UAVs, tasks, etc. Threshold tunes removal of similar solutions.

Contributions:
- Comprehensive comparison of fuzzy MCDM methods for multi-UAV mission planning. Fuzzy VIKOR selected as most suitable.
- Novel planning distance function to detect similar solutions based on CSP model of problem.  
- Threshold analysis for filtering module balances number of solutions and quality.
- Reduces operator workload by ranking and filtering optimal mission plans for selection.
- Framework can be extended, e.g. by updating profiles based on final selections.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a decision support system with ranking and filtering modules to assist operators in selecting the best mission plan from a set of solutions obtained through multi-objective optimization, using fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methods and similarity analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is the design and evaluation of a decision support system (DSS) to assist UAV operators in selecting the best mission plan among a set of optimal plans returned by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Specifically, the DSS consists of two key components:

1) A ranking module that orders the mission plans using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, namely Fuzzy VIKOR. This allows ranking the plans based on fuzzy/linguistic operator preferences on different optimization criteria. Experiments showed fuzzy MCDM methods provide better rankings than classical crisp MCDM methods.

2) A filtering module that removes very similar plans from the list using a similarity function and threshold. This reduces the number of plans presented to the operator while maintaining diversity and quality. Experiments were done to find the optimal threshold value.

In summary, the main contribution is a complete DSS with ranking and filtering to assist UAV operators to efficiently select the most suitable mission plan to execute based on their preferences, by reducing their workload and decision making complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed system was demonstrated on realistic mission scenarios.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a decision support system (DSS) with two key components: a ranking module and a filtering module. Can you explain in more detail the goal and workings of each of these modules? What specific algorithms or functions are used in each?

2. The paper compares several multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, both classical and fuzzy versions, for use in the ranking module. Why did the fuzzy MCDM methods generally perform better than the classical versions? What allows the fuzzy methods to better handle the imprecise or linguistic inputs from the operators?

3. Fuzzy VIKOR is identified as the best performing fuzzy MCDM method for the ranking module. Can you discuss why it outperformed the other fuzzy methods? What aspects of the VIKOR method make it well suited for this application? 

4. The filtering module uses a distance function to identify similar solutions to remove. Can you explain how this distance function works, including how it compares the different variable assignments? Why are specific weights used for each type of variable?

5. How was the threshold value of 1 selected for the filtering module's distance function? What tradeoffs were considered between the number of remaining solutions and preservation of diversity or hypervolume?

6. The operator profiles used for ranking solutions are defined by linguistic terms for criteria importance. How are these fuzzy terms converted into numeric weights or triangular fuzzy numbers? Can you show examples?

7. Figure 3 shows Fuzzy VIKOR had difficulty with the "Balanced" operator profile. Why might balanced preferences be harder for the MCDM methods to effectively rank solutions? How could this issue be addressed?

8. The paper uses a scoring metric based on human expert judgements to evaluate and compare the different MCDM ranking methods. Can you explain this metric and evaluation approach? What are its advantages?

9. The authors note the final selection depends on the operator's decision even after ranking and filtering. How could the system be improved to better align with operator selections using machine learning?  

10. What kinds of real-world constraints or enhancements could be incorporated into the methods proposed to make them more usable in practice for UAV mission planning?
