# [ConQueR: Query Contrast Voxel-DETR for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07289)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to improve the performance of DETR-based 3D object detectors to close the gap with state-of-the-art dense 3D detectors. 

The key issues identified with existing DETR-based 3D detectors are:

- They lag behind dense 3D detectors in performance due to relying on a fixed number of top scored predictions, which leads to many false positives for dense scenes.

- The bipartite matching loss used to train them lacks explicit supervision to discriminate between similar queries, especially in local regions, leading to many overlapping false positive predictions.

To address these issues, the central hypothesis of the paper is:

- By introducing an explicit contrastive loss between positive and negative query-GT pairs constructed from the bipartite matching, the detector can be trained to enhance positive queries matched to GTs while suppressing overlapping negative queries. 

- This "Query Contrast" mechanism will improve the accuracy and sparsity of predictions from DETR-based 3D detectors, closing the gap with state-of-the-art dense detectors.

In summary, the central research question is how to improve DETR-based 3D detectors using an explicit contrastive loss between queries, and the hypothesis is that a Query Contrast mechanism can significantly enhance their performance and sparsity.
