# [Practical Non-Intrusive GUI Exploration Testing with Visual-based   Robotic Arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10655)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing GUI testing approaches have limitations: 
1) Intrusive approaches rely on internal APIs and cannot handle embedded systems or detect compatibility bugs from user perspective.  
2) Non-intrusive approaches using robotic arms have issues with adaptive screen detection, limited operation simulation, and ignoring compatibility bugs.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes RoboTest, a practical non-intrusive GUI testing framework using visual-based robotic arms. The main components are:

1) Adaptive GUI Screen Recognition: Uses camera calibration and image processing to handle image distortion and deflection when taking GUI photos with the robotic arm camera. Can recognize GUIs of different sizes. 

2) GUI Widget Extraction: Uses refined OCR and edge detection algorithms tuned for lower resolution robotic arm photos to accurately extract text and non-text widgets.

3) Realistic Operation Simulation: Designs 6 atomic movements and 6 compound actions (click, slide etc.) for a 4-DOF robotic arm to flexibly simulate human interactions.

4) Efficiency Improvement: Implements a center-based Principle of Proximity (PoP) guided exploration strategy to choose nearby widgets as next target and reduce robotic arm movement overhead.

5) Compatibility Bug Detection: Compares GUI images and responses between device under test and a reference device to identify compatibility bugs missed by intrusive testing.

Main Contributions:
1) The first adaptive visual GUI testing framework for robotic arms.
2) Novel GUI screen recognition and widget extraction techniques for low resolution physical photos.  
3) More flexible 4-DOF robotic arm movement design to realistically simulate human testers.
4) PoP-guided strategy to improve efficiency of visual-based GUI exploration.
5) Comparison-based method to automatically detect compatibility bugs.

The approach is evaluated on real mobile apps and an industrial embedded system, showing its effectiveness, efficiency and generalizability over state-of-the-art methods.
