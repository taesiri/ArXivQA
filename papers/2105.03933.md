# [Joint Learning of Deep Retrieval Model and Product Quantization based   Embedding Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03933)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we jointly learn a deep retrieval model and product quantization based embedding index in an end-to-end fashion to improve retrieval accuracy and reduce indexing time?

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing a novel method called Poeem that integrates a product quantization based indexing layer into the deep retrieval model training.

- Using techniques like gradient straight-through estimator, warm start of centroids, and Givens rotation optimization to enable end-to-end joint training.

- Showing through experiments that Poeem improves retrieval accuracy over traditional separate offline indexing methods like Faiss, while reducing indexing time from hours to seconds.

So in summary, the paper focuses on unifying the traditionally separate steps of retrieval model training and embedding index building via a jointly learned indexing layer, in order to improve accuracy and efficiency. The experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called Poeem (product quantization based embedding index jointly trained with deep retrieval model) to learn embedding indexes jointly with deep retrieval models. The key ideas include:

- Introducing an end-to-end trainable indexing layer composed of space rotation, coarse quantization and product quantization operations. This allows jointly learning the embeddings and indexing parameters.

- Using gradient straight-through estimator to overcome the non-differentiability of quantization operations, enabling end-to-end training.

- Employing a warm start strategy and Givens rotation based algorithm to optimize the product quantization process.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on joint learning of deep retrieval models and embedding indexes compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on unifying the training of the retrieval model and the building of the embedding index into a single end-to-end process. Most prior work trains these two components separately. Jointly learning both together is an innovative approach that aims to improve retrieval accuracy and reduce indexing time.

- The proposed PoeeM method uses product quantization techniques to create the embedding index. Some other papers have explored using trees or discrete codes for jointly learned indexes. Using product quantization allows leveraging optimized techniques like space partitioning and compact codes to enable scalability.

- The paper introduces specific techniques like gradient straight-through estimation, warm start of quantization centroids, and Givens rotation optimization to make the joint training work well. These algorithmic contributions overcome hurdles faced in joint training and optimize the index.

- Experiments compare PoeeM against traditional offline indexing methods like Faiss, ScaNN, Annoy on large-scale datasets. The results validate PoeeM's benefits in accuracy and indexing time reductions. Most prior joint training papers evaluated only on small datasets.

- The indexing layer design makes PoeeM a modular component that can plugin to any existing retrieval model seamlessly. Many joint training techniques require custom neural architectures. The generic applicability is a strength.

Overall, this paper pushes forward joint training of retrieval models and embedding indexes in an innovative way. The product quantization approach, algorithmic techniques, strong experimental results, and modular design distinguish this work from prior art and contribute to the field. The method seems promising for large-scale retrieval applications.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called Poeem to jointly learn an embedding index together with a deep retrieval model. The key idea is to introduce an end-to-end trainable indexing layer into the retrieval model architecture. This indexing layer applies a sequence of operations - space rotation, coarse quantization, and product quantization - to compress the item embeddings while allowing gradient updates through the retrieval model training. Specifically, it uses gradient straight-through estimation to bypass the non-differentiable quantization operations, warm starts the quantization centroids to improve assignment uniformity, and incrementally learns the rotation matrix with block coordinate descent. The jointly learned indexing layer enables building the embedding index with almost no extra time compared to traditional offline methods like Faiss, while also improving retrieval accuracy. Overall, Poeem provides an effective way to tightly couple indexing with retrieval model training through a plug-and-play layer.
