# [PointBeV: A Sparse Approach to BeV Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00703)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces PointBeV, a novel sparse paradigm for bird's-eye view (BeV) segmentation that operates on sparse BeV features instead of dense grids. This allows precise control over memory usage, enabling the use of long temporal contexts and deployment on memory-constrained platforms. PointBeV employs an efficient two-pass training strategy, enabling focused computation on regions of interest. At inference, it can flexibly adjust between efficiency and performance without retraining. Two new modules are introduced: Sparse Feature Pulling for efficient multi-view feature extraction using sparse coordinates, and Submanifold Attention for temporal modeling. Experiments on nuScenes show state-of-the-art performance on vehicle, pedestrian and lane segmentation despite being trained solely on sparse signals. The sparse aspect provides test-time flexibility - PointBeV can balance efficiency/accuracy or exploit additional test-time inputs like LiDAR or HD maps when available, without retraining.
