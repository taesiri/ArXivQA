# [PointBeV: A Sparse Approach to BeV Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00703)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces PointBeV, a novel sparse paradigm for bird's-eye view (BeV) segmentation that operates on sparse BeV features instead of dense grids. This allows precise control over memory usage, enabling the use of long temporal contexts and deployment on memory-constrained platforms. PointBeV employs an efficient two-pass training strategy, enabling focused computation on regions of interest. At inference, it can flexibly adjust between efficiency and performance without retraining. Two new modules are introduced: Sparse Feature Pulling for efficient multi-view feature extraction using sparse coordinates, and Submanifold Attention for temporal modeling. Experiments on nuScenes show state-of-the-art performance on vehicle, pedestrian and lane segmentation despite being trained solely on sparse signals. The sparse aspect provides test-time flexibility - PointBeV can balance efficiency/accuracy or exploit additional test-time inputs like LiDAR or HD maps when available, without retraining.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

PointBeV is a sparse bird's-eye view segmentation model that operates on a subset of points in the grid and achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering flexibility to balance accuracy and efficiency at test time without retraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces PointBeV, a novel sparse approach to bird's-eye view (BeV) segmentation that operates on sparse BeV points instead of dense grids. This allows more precise control over memory usage and enables the use of long temporal contexts and higher resolutions.

2. It develops two key modules for efficient sparse operations: (a) the Sparse Feature Pulling module for extracting features from images using sparse coordinates, and (b) the Submanifold Attention module for temporal aggregation adapted from stratified attention. 

3. It introduces a two-pass "coarse/fine" training strategy that focuses computation on regions of interest and stabilizes training when using sparse points. 

4. At inference time, PointBeV can explore different efficiency/accuracy trade-offs without retraining by adjusting the sparsity. It can also exploit additional test-time information like LiDAR or HD maps.

5. PointBeV achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes for vehicle, pedestrian and lane segmentation tasks, in both static and temporal settings, despite being trained solely on sparse signals.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a novel sparse paradigm for BeV segmentation that is efficient, flexible, and achieves excellent performance. The introduced sparse modules and training strategy are key enablers of this.
