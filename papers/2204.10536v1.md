# [Sharper Utility Bounds for Differentially Private Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10536v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

Can we achieve high probability excess risk bounds with rate O(1/n) w.r.t n for differentially private (DP) models via uniform stability?

The paper focuses on analyzing the excess population risk bounds for differentially private machine learning algorithms, especially using the gradient perturbation method. 

Prior work has obtained high probability excess risk bounds that contain an unavoidable O(1/sqrt(n)) term. This paper provides sharper bounds and aims to remove this bottleneck by introducing generalized Bernstein condition and proposing a new differentially private algorithm called max{1,g}-Normalized Gradient Perturbation (m-NGP).

The key contributions and results of this paper can be summarized as:

- Provides the first O(sqrt(p)/(n*epsilon)) high probability excess population risk bound for DP models under assumptions of Lipschitz, smoothness and Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. 

- Under Hölder smoothness and PL condition, achieves O(p^(1/4)/(n^(α/(1+2α))*epsilon^(1/2))) high probability bound, but cannot get O(1/n) rate.

- Proposes m-NGP algorithm that achieves O(sqrt(p)/(n*epsilon)) high probability bound under Hölder smoothness and PL condition, giving the first O(1/n) high probability bound without smoothness assumptions.

- Experiments on real datasets demonstrate m-NGP improves accuracy and convergence over standard gradient perturbation method.

In summary, the central hypothesis is providing sharper high probability excess risk bounds with O(1/n) rate for DP models, which is positively answered by the theoretical analysis and algorithm proposed in this paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the first O(sqrt(p)/(n*epsilon)) high probability excess population risk bound for differentially private algorithms under the assumptions of G-Lipschitz, L-smooth, and Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. This is based on gradient perturbation method. 

2. It relaxes the Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions to α-Hölder smoothness. Under these assumptions, it shows the high probability excess population risk bound is O(n^(-α/(1+2α))). This cannot achieve O(1/n) when α is in (0,1].

3. To overcome the limitation in 2, it proposes a variant of gradient perturbation called max{1,g}-Normalized Gradient Perturbation (m-NGP). It shows this algorithm can achieve O(sqrt(p)/(n*epsilon)) high probability excess population risk bound under α-Hölder smoothness and PL condition. This is the first O(1/n) high probability bound without smoothness assumptions.

4. It evaluates m-NGP on real datasets and shows it improves accuracy and convergence rate compared to traditional gradient perturbation. This demonstrates the theoretical utility bound improvements also lead to better practical performance.

In summary, the key contributions are sharper utility bounds for differentially private learning, especially removing the O(1/sqrt(n)) bottleneck, and proposing the m-NGP algorithm along with empirical validation of its benefits. The theoretical and empirical results significantly advance the utility guarantees for differential privacy.
