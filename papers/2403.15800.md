# [MRC-based Nested Medical NER with Co-prediction and Adaptive   Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: Medical named entity recognition (NER) is challenging due to the complex nested structures and sophisticated medical terminologies. Existing models struggle to effectively handle nested entities and make full use of entity type information. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes an MRC-based nested medical NER model called MRC-CAP that introduces the following innovations:

1) A task-adaptive pre-training strategy to optimize the pretrained model for the medical domain.

2) A joint predictor combining Biaffine and MLP to improve recognition performance. Conditional layer normalization and entity type embeddings are used in the Biaffine predictor to further incorporate entity type knowledge.  

3) Multiple word-pair embeddings (grid representation, distance and region embeddings) fed into a multi-granularity dilated convolution layer to capture interactions between words at different distances.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a medical NER model based on machine reading comprehension that jointly predicts entities using Biaffine and MLP, and introduces techniques like task-adaptive pretraining and multiple word-pair embeddings for performance improvements.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on the CMeEE benchmark, outperforming existing models as well as large language models like ChatGPT.

- Demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed techniques through ablation studies. The joint predictor is shown to clearly improve recognition ability compared to single predictors.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing MRC-based approaches for nested medical NER by effectively incorporating entity type information and modeling inter-word interactions. The proposed MRC-CAP model achieves superior performance on nested Chinese medical NER.
