# [When Do Curricula Work in Federated Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12712)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can curriculum learning principles contribute to alleviating the effects of data heterogeneity in federated learning?

The authors aim to investigate whether and how ordering samples from easy to hard during training (curriculum learning) can help federated learning models deal with non-IID (heterogeneous) data across clients. They compare curriculum, anti-curriculum, and random curriculum strategies empirically and theoretically.

Specifically, some key questions the paper seems to explore are:

- Which curriculum learning paradigm is effective in federated learning, and under what conditions?

- Can curriculum learning alleviate the statistical data heterogeneity in federated learning?

- Does the efficacy of curriculum learning in federated learning depend on the underlying client data distributions? 

- Is there a relationship between curriculum learning and client selection strategies?

- Can curriculum learning be applied at both the individual client level and across clients?

So in summary, the central research question is focused on understanding if and how curriculum learning can help address the key challenge of heterogeneous data in federated learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a comprehensive study on the benefit of employing curriculum learning (CL) in federated learning (FL), under both homogeneous and heterogeneous data settings. 

2. It conducts extensive experiments evaluating a wide range of curricula and pacing functions over three datasets - CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and FMNIST. The key findings are:

- CL boosts accuracy under both IID and Non-IID data distributions.

- The benefits of CL are more pronounced when client data is heterogeneous. CL can alleviate the accuracy drop in FL when clients' data is statistically heterogeneous. 

- Proposes curriculum learning on clients which leverages heterogeneity across clients. Shows this has synergistic effects when combined with CL on client data.

3. Provides theoretical analysis modeling CL as biased local SGD, with bias growing over iterations. Derives convergence guarantees for both strongly convex and nonconvex objectives.

4. Answers several key questions regarding when and how CL is effective for FL, such as the efficacy relative to data heterogeneity, amount of data per client, choice of scoring function and pacing function.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive empirical and theoretical study of curriculum learning for federated learning, providing insights into when and how it can be effectively applied in this setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes applying curriculum learning in federated learning to help alleviate the negative impact of non-IID data, provides theoretical analysis of how curriculum learning can improve convergence, and introduces the idea of applying curricula over clients to leverage heterogeneity between clients.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying curriculum learning concepts to federated learning settings. Some key aspects in relation to other existing works:

- Curriculum learning has been extensively studied in centralized training settings, but this appears to be the first work investigating it for federated learning specifically. The paper provides novel analysis and results on curriculum learning tailored to the decentralized nature of federated learning.

- The paper presents theoretical convergence analysis for federated learning with curriculum learning under both convex and non-convex assumptions. This provides formal grounding and explanations for the empirical results. Other works have not provided similar theoretical analysis.

- The paper investigates curriculum learning on both the client data (data curriculum) and the clients themselves (client curriculum). Applying curriculum concepts to client selection is a novel idea proposed in this work. 

- The paper conducts extensive experiments on multiple datasets, network architectures, and federated learning algorithms to validate the efficacy of curriculum learning in different settings. Many prior works have been narrower in scope.

- The paper identifies conditions like limited training time, noisy data, and heterogeneous data distributions where curriculum learning is particularly beneficial for federated learning. This provides guidance on when curriculum learning is most impactful.

- The paper compares expert-guided curriculum versus self-guided curriculum based on the global model, providing insights into curriculum design choices for federated learning.

In summary, this work significantly advances the understanding and application of curriculum learning to federated settings through its combination of theory, empirical analysis, and novel ideas like client curriculum. It represents a thorough investigation of an underexplored area compared to existing literature.
