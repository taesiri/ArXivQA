# [When Do Curricula Work in Federated Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12712)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can curriculum learning principles contribute to alleviating the effects of data heterogeneity in federated learning?

The authors aim to investigate whether and how ordering samples from easy to hard during training (curriculum learning) can help federated learning models deal with non-IID (heterogeneous) data across clients. They compare curriculum, anti-curriculum, and random curriculum strategies empirically and theoretically.

Specifically, some key questions the paper seems to explore are:

- Which curriculum learning paradigm is effective in federated learning, and under what conditions?

- Can curriculum learning alleviate the statistical data heterogeneity in federated learning?

- Does the efficacy of curriculum learning in federated learning depend on the underlying client data distributions? 

- Is there a relationship between curriculum learning and client selection strategies?

- Can curriculum learning be applied at both the individual client level and across clients?

So in summary, the central research question is focused on understanding if and how curriculum learning can help address the key challenge of heterogeneous data in federated learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a comprehensive study on the benefit of employing curriculum learning (CL) in federated learning (FL), under both homogeneous and heterogeneous data settings. 

2. It conducts extensive experiments evaluating a wide range of curricula and pacing functions over three datasets - CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and FMNIST. The key findings are:

- CL boosts accuracy under both IID and Non-IID data distributions.

- The benefits of CL are more pronounced when client data is heterogeneous. CL can alleviate the accuracy drop in FL when clients' data is statistically heterogeneous. 

- Proposes curriculum learning on clients which leverages heterogeneity across clients. Shows this has synergistic effects when combined with CL on client data.

3. Provides theoretical analysis modeling CL as biased local SGD, with bias growing over iterations. Derives convergence guarantees for both strongly convex and nonconvex objectives.

4. Answers several key questions regarding when and how CL is effective for FL, such as the efficacy relative to data heterogeneity, amount of data per client, choice of scoring function and pacing function.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive empirical and theoretical study of curriculum learning for federated learning, providing insights into when and how it can be effectively applied in this setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes applying curriculum learning in federated learning to help alleviate the negative impact of non-IID data, provides theoretical analysis of how curriculum learning can improve convergence, and introduces the idea of applying curricula over clients to leverage heterogeneity between clients.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying curriculum learning concepts to federated learning settings. Some key aspects in relation to other existing works:

- Curriculum learning has been extensively studied in centralized training settings, but this appears to be the first work investigating it for federated learning specifically. The paper provides novel analysis and results on curriculum learning tailored to the decentralized nature of federated learning.

- The paper presents theoretical convergence analysis for federated learning with curriculum learning under both convex and non-convex assumptions. This provides formal grounding and explanations for the empirical results. Other works have not provided similar theoretical analysis.

- The paper investigates curriculum learning on both the client data (data curriculum) and the clients themselves (client curriculum). Applying curriculum concepts to client selection is a novel idea proposed in this work. 

- The paper conducts extensive experiments on multiple datasets, network architectures, and federated learning algorithms to validate the efficacy of curriculum learning in different settings. Many prior works have been narrower in scope.

- The paper identifies conditions like limited training time, noisy data, and heterogeneous data distributions where curriculum learning is particularly beneficial for federated learning. This provides guidance on when curriculum learning is most impactful.

- The paper compares expert-guided curriculum versus self-guided curriculum based on the global model, providing insights into curriculum design choices for federated learning.

In summary, this work significantly advances the understanding and application of curriculum learning to federated settings through its combination of theory, empirical analysis, and novel ideas like client curriculum. It represents a thorough investigation of an underexplored area compared to existing literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Studying the efficacy of curriculum learning (CL) on a wider variety of tasks, datasets, and model architectures beyond what was explored in this paper. The authors note they strategically focused on CIFAR and FOOD datasets to allow a comprehensive analysis of CL methodologies, but results may not generalize fully beyond these domains.

- Exploring the benefits of CL in other decentralized learning settings besides federated learning, such as split learning, collaborative learning, etc. The principles of CL could potentially be useful in other distributed learning paradigms.

- Developing adaptive curricula methods that can automatically determine the pacing and difficulty of examples based on real-time feedback from the model during training. The curricula in this work were predefined rather than adaptive.

- Further theoretical analysis to fully explain the improved performance of CL on heterogeneous data distributions, beyond the initial biased SGD analysis presented. More work is needed to formally characterize how CL affects optimization trajectory.

- Studying how to best apply CL in the context of personalization in federated learning, which was not a focus in this work. Ordering strategies may be useful for per-user model adaptation.

- Exploring how CL can enhance efficiency, stability, and fairness in federated learning, important real-world deployment considerations.

- Developing curricula directly over the raw input features rather than using model-based scoring functions. This could remove bias introduced by pre-trained models.

So in summary, the authors propose broad future work on applying CL to new tasks and models, adapting CL automatically, further convergence theory, integration with personalization, and impacts on efficiency, stability, and fairness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes utilizing curriculum learning principles in federated learning settings in order to alleviate the negative impacts of heterogeneous data distributions across clients. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, the authors demonstrate that curriculum learning, which exposes models to an ordered curriculum of training examples ranging from easy to hard, can significantly boost performance in the presence of non-IID data. They find curriculum learning is particularly effective when data heterogeneity is high, as ordering by difficulty makes early training more IID. The paper introduces curriculum learning for both the data at each client as well as the set of clients participating in training. Results show curriculum learning on clients also improves performance by leveraging heterogeneity in the clients themselves. Overall, the research provides both empirical evidence and theoretical motivation for how principles of curriculum learning can greatly benefit federated learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using ordered learning, specifically curriculum learning, in federated learning to help alleviate the performance issues caused by heterogeneous data across clients. Federated learning involves training a global model over decentralized data located on remote devices called clients. Non-identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients is a key challenge in federated learning that results in poor model performance compared to centralized training. This paper investigates whether curriculum learning, which involves training models on easy examples first before gradually increasing difficulty, can help mitigate the effects of non-IID data in federated learning. 

The authors perform an empirical study over several datasets, model architectures, and curricula design choices. They find that curriculum learning improves performance compared to standard federated learning, especially as the heterogeneity of data across clients increases. Theoretical analysis is also provided to explain why curriculum learning helps, relating it to training initially on more IID data samples. Additionally, the concept of curriculum learning is extended to the clients themselves, proposing an ordered participation schedule to further leverage heterogeneity across clients. The combination of data curriculum and client curriculum is shown to have synergistic effects in improving global model quality.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a study on the use of curriculum learning (CL) in federated learning. The key components of a curriculum are defined as:

- The scoring function: Maps an input sample to a numerical score indicating its difficulty. Loss-based dynamic measures are used rather than fixed scores. 

- The pacing function: Determines the schedule of how training examples are introduced over time, starting with easier examples and progressively increasing difficulty. 

- The order: Samples are ordered from easy to hard for curriculum learning, hard to easy for anti-curriculum, and random for random curriculum. 

The method is evaluated by training common architectures (LeNet, ResNet) on image datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, FMNIST) using standard federated learning algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, etc). A range of scoring functions, pacing functions, curriculum orderings, and data heterogeneity settings are tested. The key findings are:

- Curriculum learning improves accuracy, especially for non-IID heterogeneous data. The more heterogeneous the data, the greater the benefits.

- Curriculum learning appears to make the objective landscape more convex initially, enabling faster optimization. 

- A novel "curriculum on clients" is proposed to leverage heterogeneity across clients and has synergistic effects.

So in summary, the paper comprehensively evaluates curriculum learning in federated learning and shows it is an effective plug-in method to improve performance.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates curriculum learning in federated learning settings. The authors propose applying curriculum learning techniques like scoring functions, pacing functions, and orderings to the training data at each client device. They also introduce the idea of "curriculum on clients" where the clients themselves are ordered from easy to difficult for participation. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on image classification tasks, they find that curriculum learning can alleviate the negative effects of heterogeneous (non-IID) data in federated learning.
