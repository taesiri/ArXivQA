# [When Do Curricula Work in Federated Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12712)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can curriculum learning principles contribute to alleviating the effects of data heterogeneity in federated learning?The authors aim to investigate whether and how ordering samples from easy to hard during training (curriculum learning) can help federated learning models deal with non-IID (heterogeneous) data across clients. They compare curriculum, anti-curriculum, and random curriculum strategies empirically and theoretically.Specifically, some key questions the paper seems to explore are:- Which curriculum learning paradigm is effective in federated learning, and under what conditions?- Can curriculum learning alleviate the statistical data heterogeneity in federated learning?- Does the efficacy of curriculum learning in federated learning depend on the underlying client data distributions? - Is there a relationship between curriculum learning and client selection strategies?- Can curriculum learning be applied at both the individual client level and across clients?So in summary, the central research question is focused on understanding if and how curriculum learning can help address the key challenge of heterogeneous data in federated learning.
