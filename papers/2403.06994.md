## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Falls are a major health risk for the elderly population. Effective fall detection and prevention requires accurate sensing and recognition of falls. However, existing solutions have limitations in reliability, user adoption, computational complexity, and resilience to noise.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a full physical sensor-based deep learning fall detection system called TSFallDetect. It consists of:
  1) A wearable sensor device with accelerometers, gyroscopes and pressure sensors worn on the foot to capture motion data 
  2) A mobile app to receive, process and visualize data as well as run ML models
  3) A server to store data and models

- A new deep learning model called FallSeqTCN is proposed to detect falls from the time-series sensor data. It uses temporal convolutional networks to capture long-term patterns in the data.

Main Contributions:
- An end-to-end fall detection system with a practical wearable sensing approach designed for user comfort and adoption
- Collection of a new multi-sensor dataset with different fall types using the designed sensor device  
- A FallSeqTCN model that outperforms baseline ML approaches in classifying falls, with over 80% recall on new and public datasets
- Demonstration of the feasibility of the system through empirical evaluation on real user data

In summary, the key novelty is a reliable and practical fall detection system with innovations in sensing hardware, data collection, and a tailored deep learning approach for time-series classification of falls using sensor data. The system has the potential for real-world deployment and impact in improving safety for the elderly.
