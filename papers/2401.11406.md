# [Adversarial Augmentation Training Makes Action Recognition Models More   Robust to Realistic Video Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11406)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video action recognition models suffer from lack of robustness when tested on data with different distributions than the training data. This is due to factors like camera motion, viewpoint changes, intra-class variation, etc.

- Existing approaches for improving robustness like data augmentation and domain adaptation have limitations in generalizing to unseen test distributions.

Proposed Solution: 
- Two novel cross-dataset evaluation protocols to assess model resilience to distribution shifts using naturally sourced datasets:

1. Matched Class Evaluation: Construct subsets from HMDB, UCF and Kinetics datasets with overlapping classes for training and testing.

2. Cosine Similarity Evaluation: Use cosine similarity between training and test features as logits, without needing class alignment.

- Adversarial augmentation training to generate "hard" examples by optimizing augmentations to maximize loss.

- Curriculum adversarial training which gradually increases augmentation strength over training.

- Apply adversarial training with maximum entropy regularization to encourage evenly balanced predictions.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrate significant performance degradation on proposed cross-dataset benchmarks, quantifying challenge of distribution shift.

- Propose two new protocols for evaluating resilience to natural distribution shifts.

- Show improved robustness from adversarial augmentation training and curriculum training across multiple architectures.

- Release subsets of HMDB, UCF and Kinetics datasets with aligned classes to facilitate further research.

In summary, the paper tackles video action recognition's vulnerability to distribution shifts between train and test data. It proposes two new benchmarking approaches using naturally sourced datasets, and demonstrates enhanced robustness from adversarial augmentation strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes adversarial augmentation training and new cross-dataset evaluation protocols to improve video action recognition model robustness to realistic distribution shifts between training and test data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing two new cross-dataset evaluation protocols to assess model resilience to distribution disparity using naturally sourced datasets:

(a) Constructing new benchmarks by identifying overlapping classes between HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400. Models are trained on either HMDB or UCF, and evaluated on Kinetics data. 

(b) Introducing a similarity-based evaluation approach that estimates predictions using cosine similarity between embedded training and test features, without requiring class alignment.

2. Empirically demonstrating through experiments that the proposed adversarial augmentation and curriculum adversarial training frameworks enhance robustness to realistic distribution shifts between the training and test datasets.

3. Publicly releasing the constructed subsets of HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400 to enable further research on this problem.

In summary, the main contributions are the two new evaluation protocols, showing that adversarial augmentation improves robustness to distribution shifts, and releasing new benchmark datasets.
