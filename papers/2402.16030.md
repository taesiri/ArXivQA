# [Don't Forget Your Reward Values: Language Model Alignment via   Value-based Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16030)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Recent work has raised concerns about the complexity and instability of using PPO for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. 
- Alternative order-based calibration methods solely focus on calibrating the order of rewards, failing to effectively utilize the actual reward values. This causes misalignment between model probabilities and human preferences.

Proposed Solution - Value-based Calibration (VCB):
- Proves existing order-based methods can be derived from one optimization problem under different entropy settings.
- Shows order-based methods' limitation in using reward values stems from eliminating the partition function during reparameterization.   
- Proposes VCB method that employs a difference method to eliminate the partition function while preserving the reward function. This enables aligning model probabilities proportionally to reward values.

Key Contributions:
- Unifies multiple order-based methods under one optimization framework and analyzes their limitations.
- Proposes novel VCB method for better aligning LLMs using reward values instead of just reward order. 
- Experiments on 2.8B parameter LLM validate VCB outperforms order-based methods on dialogue and summarization tasks.
- Ablation studies demonstrate VCB's robustness. Case studies illustrate VCB's effectiveness in mitigating probability misalignment.

In summary, the paper identifies issues with existing order-based LLM alignment methods and proposes an improved value-based calibration approach that better aligns probabilities to human preferences. Comprehensive experiments highlight the advantages of this new technique.
