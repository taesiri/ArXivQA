# [TRC: Trust Region Conditional Value at Risk for Safe Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00344)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a trust region-based reinforcement learning method called TRC for solving constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), where the goal is to maximize cumulative reward while satisfying constraints on the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the cumulative cost. CVaR focuses on the tail of the cost distribution, making the constraints more conservative than expectations. The key challenge is that computing CVaR gradients is difficult. To address this, the authors first derive an upper bound on CVaR that can be approximated within a trust region. Then a CVaR-constrained policy optimization subproblem is formed based on this approximation. By iteratively solving this subproblem using linear quadratic constrained linear programming, optimal policies can be obtained while satisfying the CVaR constraints. Experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TRC outperforms prior methods, improving performance by 93% on average while satisfying constraints. A key contribution is the derivations to enable efficient CVaR-based policy optimization within a trust region.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes TRC, a trust region-based reinforcement learning method that maximizes reward while satisfying safety constraints on conditional value at risk to enable safe robot learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1. The authors derive an upper bound on conditional value at risk (CVaR) and an approximation of this upper bound within a trust region. 

2. They propose a policy update rule and formulate a CVaR-constrained subproblem using this upper bound approximation. This allows them to optimize policies using a trust region method while satisfying CVaR constraints.

3. They formulate generalized advantage estimation (GAE) for the newly defined cost square function to reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. 

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a trust region-based reinforcement learning method called TRC that can maximize rewards while satisfying safety constraints defined by CVaR. TRC shows improved performance over other baseline methods in simulation and sim-to-real robot navigation experiments.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents should learn to maximize rewards while satisfying safety constraints. Common constraints are on the expectation of cost sums, but these cannot distinguish between policies with different risk levels. Using constraints on conditional value at risk (CVaR) instead focuses on the tail of the cost distribution and avoids risky policies. However, existing CVaR-constrained RL methods have limitations in stability or performance.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a trust region-based RL method called TRC that maximizes rewards while constraining CVaR of costs below a limit. 

Key ideas:
- Derive an upper bound on CVaR that can be approximated within a trust region around the current policy. This allows formulating a constrained optimization problem to find policy updates.

- Use linear and quadratic approximations and solve as a constrained linear program, similar to prior trust region policy optimization methods.

- Update value functions using generalized advantage estimation (GAE) to reduce variance. Newly introduce GAE for the CVaR-related cost square function.

- Iterate by solving constrained optimization problems within trust regions to monotonically improve policies.

Contributions:
- Novel upper bound on CVaR and method to approximate it differentiably in a trust region

- New trust region-based update rule for CVaR-constrained RL, ensuring stability

- Introduction of GAE for CVaR's cost square function 

- Evaluated on navigation tasks in simulation and real robots, outperforming prior methods in performance while satisfying constraints

The proposed TRC method enables learning of high-performing policies that avoid risks more effectively than existing approaches. The trust region approach also improves training stability.
