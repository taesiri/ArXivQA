# [TRC: Trust Region Conditional Value at Risk for Safe Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00344)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a trust region-based reinforcement learning method called TRC for solving constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), where the goal is to maximize cumulative reward while satisfying constraints on the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the cumulative cost. CVaR focuses on the tail of the cost distribution, making the constraints more conservative than expectations. The key challenge is that computing CVaR gradients is difficult. To address this, the authors first derive an upper bound on CVaR that can be approximated within a trust region. Then a CVaR-constrained policy optimization subproblem is formed based on this approximation. By iteratively solving this subproblem using linear quadratic constrained linear programming, optimal policies can be obtained while satisfying the CVaR constraints. Experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TRC outperforms prior methods, improving performance by 93% on average while satisfying constraints. A key contribution is the derivations to enable efficient CVaR-based policy optimization within a trust region.
