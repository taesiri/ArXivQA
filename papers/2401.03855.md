# [Boldly Going Where No Benchmark Has Gone Before: Exposing Bias and   Shortcomings in Code Generation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03855)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code generation from natural language descriptions is an emerging field with rapid progress being made on benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP for evaluating code-LLMs. 
- However, there has been no rigorous analysis done on the diversity and difficulty levels of problems in these popular benchmarks. This could lead to overestimating the capabilities of code-LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a hierarchical classification of 37 programming concepts into basic, intermediate and advanced levels that can serve as a template for benchmark creation. 
- Extensive human annotation experiments were conducted on 164 problems each from HumanEval and MBPP datasets. Annotators labeled problems by difficulty level and programming concepts required.

Key Observations:
- Over 80% of problems in both datasets were labeled as easy by the annotators, revealing a bias towards simpler problems.
- 5 concepts like mathematics, conditions, data structures etc. dominated while 14 concepts had negligible or no representation.
- The benchmarks lack a balanced distribution across difficulty levels and programming concepts.

Main Contributions:
- First paper to provide an in-depth analysis of diversity of widely used code generation benchmarks.
- Proposes a hierarchical programming concepts template to enable balanced benchmark creation.
- Findings reveal biases in existing benchmarks that could lead to overestimating code-LLM capabilities.
- Highlights need for more comprehensive benchmarks to accurately evaluate code-LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of two popular Python code generation benchmarks, revealing significant biases towards easy problems covering a limited subset of programming concepts, which may lead to overestimation of language model performance on such tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper introduces a comprehensive hierarchical classification of programming concepts, categorizing them into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels. It then conducts a rigorous evaluation of two prominent Python code generation benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, through extensive human annotation experiments. The key findings reveal:

1) A significant bias towards a small subset of programming concepts in the benchmarks, leaving the vast majority of concepts underrepresented. 

2) Over 80% of the problems are perceived as easy by human annotators, raising concerns about the benchmarks' generalizability and effectiveness in evaluating code generation models.

In summary, the paper demonstrates issues of limited diversity and overrepresentation of simple problems in widely used code generation benchmarks. It highlights the need for more balanced and comprehensive benchmarks to enable accurate assessments of code generation models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Code generation - The paper focuses on evaluating benchmarks and datasets used for code generation, specifically for Python code generation.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper discusses code-generating large language models (Code-LLMs) and how existing benchmarks may overestimate their capabilities.

- HumanEval and MBPP - These are two widely used Python code generation benchmarks that the authors evaluate in the paper.

- Programming concepts - The paper proposes a hierarchical classification of programming concepts into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. 

- Difficulty levels - The paper has human annotators categorize programming problems into easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels.

- Selection bias - A key finding is that existing benchmarks demonstrate selection bias towards easy problems covering only a limited subset of programming concepts.

- Performance evaluation - The paper discusses the commonly used "pass@k" metric to evaluate code generation model performance.

In summary, the key focus is on analyzing biases and limitations in existing code generation benchmarks, especially HumanEval and MBPP, through human annotation experiments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical classification of programming concepts into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced levels. What were the criteria used to categorize concepts into these levels? Could other categorization schemes have been used instead?

2. The paper conducted human annotation experiments to evaluate the diversity and difficulty levels of existing benchmarks. What were some limitations or potential biases introduced by having the annotations done by postgraduate Computer Science students? 

3. The observations reveal a bias towards easy problems and basic concepts in the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks. In your opinion, what proportion of problems should ideally be easy, medium and hard to better evaluate code generation models?

4. The paper argues existing benchmarks may allow code generation models to overstate their capabilities. Do you think the proposed hierarchical programming concepts template alone is sufficient to create a more balanced benchmark? What other criteria need to be considered?

5. The pass@k metric is commonly used to evaluate code generation model performance. What are some limitations of this metric? Can you suggest better evaluation metrics aligned with the goals of code generation?

6. The paper focuses only on Python programming language. Do you think the conclusions would generalize to other languages like Java, C++ etc. or programming paradigms like functional programming? Why or why not?

7. The annotators categorized problems based on their individual expertise and experiences. How can we account for subjective perceptions of problem difficulty while benchmarking? Is there a way to establish objective difficulty levels? 

8. The paper identifies 14 programming concepts that were completely absent from the HumanEval and MBPP datasets. Can you name some of those concepts and discuss why they are important to include in a benchmark?

9. The paper proposes 37 programming concepts in its template. Do you think some redundant concepts can be merged or removed? What other important concepts would you add to make the template more comprehensive?

10. The paper acknowledges some key limitations like potential selection bias in sampling MBPP problems and lack of annotator diversity. What steps could be taken in future work to mitigate these limitations?
