# [Panoptic Lifting for 3D Scene Understanding with Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09802)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is how to build a 3D panoptic scene understanding model from only 2D images and their noisy machine-generated panoptic segmentation masks. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel panoptic radiance field representation that can jointly model appearance, semantics and 3D-consistent instances for novel view synthesis. The key question is how to effectively lift the noisy 2D panoptic segmentation masks into this coherent 3D volumetric representation in a robust way.The main hypothesis is that by using a combination of techniques - including test time augmentations for better label confidences, segment consistency loss, bounded segmentation fields, and stopping semantics-to-geometry gradients - the proposed panoptic lifting approach can overcome the limitations of inconsistent machine-generated labels and produce high-quality 3D panoptic scene representations.The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed Panoptic Lifting approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art 2D and 3D baselines on metrics like semantic/panoptic segmentation quality and novel view synthesis, when trained on the same input imagery and noisy 2D labels. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to effectively lift noisy 2D labels into a robust and consistent 3D panoptic radiance field representation.In summary, the paper tackles the research question of how to effectively build 3D panoptic scene representations from only images and noisy 2D labels, via a novel panoptic radiance field formulation and robust panoptic lifting techniques. The experiments aim to validate the proposed approach can outperform baselines given the same challenging input data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel method called Panoptic Lifting for learning panoptic 3D volumetric representations from 2D images. Specifically:- The paper proposes a panoptic radiance field representation that jointly models the radiance, semantics, and instances for a 3D scene. This allows rendering color images, depth, semantics, and instances from novel viewpoints.- The method takes only 2D images with machine-generated panoptic segmentation masks as input. It lifts these noisy 2D labels into a consistent 3D panoptic representation without requiring ground truth 3D data. - Several techniques are introduced to make the lifting robust to noise in the machine-generated labels, including test-time augmentations for confidence estimation, segment consistency loss, bounded segmentation fields, and stopping semantics-to-geometry gradients.- Experiments validate the approach on challenging datasets like Hypersim, Replica, and ScanNet. The method improves scene-level panoptic quality over state-of-the-art by 8.4-13.8% while also synthesizing high quality novel views.In summary, the key contribution is a novel panoptic radiance field formulation that can lift noisy 2D machine-generated labels into a consistent 3D representation for robust panoptic novel view synthesis, without requiring expensive ground truth 3D supervision.
