# [Panoptic Lifting for 3D Scene Understanding with Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09802)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is how to build a 3D panoptic scene understanding model from only 2D images and their noisy machine-generated panoptic segmentation masks. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel panoptic radiance field representation that can jointly model appearance, semantics and 3D-consistent instances for novel view synthesis. The key question is how to effectively lift the noisy 2D panoptic segmentation masks into this coherent 3D volumetric representation in a robust way.The main hypothesis is that by using a combination of techniques - including test time augmentations for better label confidences, segment consistency loss, bounded segmentation fields, and stopping semantics-to-geometry gradients - the proposed panoptic lifting approach can overcome the limitations of inconsistent machine-generated labels and produce high-quality 3D panoptic scene representations.The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed Panoptic Lifting approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art 2D and 3D baselines on metrics like semantic/panoptic segmentation quality and novel view synthesis, when trained on the same input imagery and noisy 2D labels. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to effectively lift noisy 2D labels into a robust and consistent 3D panoptic radiance field representation.In summary, the paper tackles the research question of how to effectively build 3D panoptic scene representations from only images and noisy 2D labels, via a novel panoptic radiance field formulation and robust panoptic lifting techniques. The experiments aim to validate the proposed approach can outperform baselines given the same challenging input data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel method called Panoptic Lifting for learning panoptic 3D volumetric representations from 2D images. Specifically:- The paper proposes a panoptic radiance field representation that jointly models the radiance, semantics, and instances for a 3D scene. This allows rendering color images, depth, semantics, and instances from novel viewpoints.- The method takes only 2D images with machine-generated panoptic segmentation masks as input. It lifts these noisy 2D labels into a consistent 3D panoptic representation without requiring ground truth 3D data. - Several techniques are introduced to make the lifting robust to noise in the machine-generated labels, including test-time augmentations for confidence estimation, segment consistency loss, bounded segmentation fields, and stopping semantics-to-geometry gradients.- Experiments validate the approach on challenging datasets like Hypersim, Replica, and ScanNet. The method improves scene-level panoptic quality over state-of-the-art by 8.4-13.8% while also synthesizing high quality novel views.In summary, the key contribution is a novel panoptic radiance field formulation that can lift noisy 2D machine-generated labels into a consistent 3D representation for robust panoptic novel view synthesis, without requiring expensive ground truth 3D supervision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Panoptic Lifting, a novel approach to learn 3D panoptic scene representations directly from 2D images and their machine-generated panoptic segmentation masks, enabling rendering of color images with 3D-consistent semantics and instance segmentations from novel viewpoints.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several key contributions to the field of panoptic 3D scene understanding through neural radiance fields:- It proposes a new approach called Panoptic Lifting to create a panoptic radiance field representing color, depth, semantics, and class-agnostic instance IDs in a unified way. This allows rendering novel views with consistent panoptic segmentation. - It shows how to effectively lift noisy 2D panoptic segmentations from an off-the-shelf model into a consistent 3D representation. This is done through various techniques to handle label noise like test-time augmentations, segment consistency losses, and more.- It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on challenging real-world datasets like Replica, ScanNet, and Hypersim. The method improves scene-level panoptic quality by 8-14% over previous works by effectively harmonizing noisy 2D labels.- It poses minimal input requirements compared to prior works - using only posed RGB images and 2D machine-generated panoptic labels. It does not rely on ground truth labels, 3D bounding boxes, or multiple pre-trained models.The key differences from related work are:- Compared to Panoptic-NeRF and DM-NeRF, it does not require ground truth labels and shows more robustness to noise in 2D labels.- Compared to Panoptic Neural Fields, it relies only on 2D labels rather than both 2D and 3D detections, making it simpler and more robust.- Compared to Semantic-NeRF, the panoptic formulation and explicit handling of label noise lead to large improvements in segmentation accuracy.Overall, this paper pushes the state of the art in learning consistent panoptic neural radiance fields from realistic input data. The techniques for handling label noise and the strong experimental results are significant contributions towards more practical 3D scene understanding.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Extending the method to handle dynamic scenes with moving objects. The current method is designed for static scenes. The authors mention exploring incorporating scene flow estimation or learning object motions over time to handle dynamic scenes.- Incorporating the panoptic lifting approach into real-time SLAM systems like BA-Net. Currently the approach runs offline due to the need for pose estimation, 2D segmentation, and neural field optimization as pre-processing steps. Integrating it into a real-time system would be interesting future work. - Exploring open world segmentation to expand the set of classes that can be handled beyond those in the original 2D segmentation model's training set. The authors suggest using self-supervised instance clustering for this.- Improving run-time performance through optimizations like pruning and weight sharing. The current hybrid implicit-explicit scene representation helps but further speed-ups could enable real-time performance.- Extending the approach to video sequences and exploring view consistency over time. The current work focuses on view consistency across space for a static scene capture. Enforcing temporal consistency over frames of a video could be an interesting extension.- Exploring the use of different 2D segmentation networks beyond Mask2Former as the source of machine-generated labels. This could provide insights into how robust the lifting approach is.- Applying the method to large outdoor scenes and evaluating the impact of sparser views and increased scale on performance. The current experiments are on relatively small indoor scenes.In summary, the key future directions mentioned are around scaling the approach to dynamic scenes, larger environments, and real-time use cases, as well as exploring robustness to different input sources and expanding the capabilities of the model.
