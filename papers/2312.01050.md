# [Detection and Analysis of Stress-Related Posts in Reddit Acamedic   Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01050)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stress is a major global health issue affecting mental wellbeing. Early detection of stress is crucial for timely interventions. 
- Existing methods rely on self-reporting or specialized equipment, having limitations in awareness, accessibility and accuracy. 
- There is a need for an automated, scalable approach to detect stress levels from textual data.
- Specifically, there is limited understanding of stress patterns across academic levels.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using natural language processing and machine learning for automatic stress detection in textual posts on Reddit.
- The methods are applied to posts from various academic subreddits to analyze and compare stress levels across professor, PhD, graduate, and bachelor student levels.

Key Contributions:
- Developed an automated pipeline using logistic regression and bag-of-words for stress detection, achieving 77.8% accuracy.
- Performed analysis on a new dataset of 1584 posts and 122684 comments from academic subreddits.
- Found the overall academic stress level to be 29%, with sadness and fear as main emotions.  
- Identified topic-based stress factors specific to each academic level. Students have academic-related stressors while professors handle student-related issues.
- Revealed patterns of higher stress for graduate students compared to other levels, countering some previous findings. 
- The analysis provides insights to help admin and educators tailor interventions per academic level to curb stress.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and applied contributions in textual stress detection across academia to enable data-driven mental health support.
