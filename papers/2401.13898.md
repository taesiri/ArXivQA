# [Cross-Modal Prototype based Multimodal Federated Learning under Severely   Missing Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13898)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal federated learning (MFL) allows collaborative training of models across clients with multimodal data while preserving privacy. However, it faces two key challenges - data heterogeneity across clients and missing modalities.
- Missing modalities can significantly degrade performance, especially when rates are high (e.g 80%). Prior works have not addressed both heterogeneity and missing modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Multimodal Federated Cross Prototype Learning (MFCPL) to address both challenges. 
- It introduces the concept of "complete prototypes" that encapsulate rich knowledge from all modalities. These guide training, especially for clients with missing modalities.
- Complete prototypes provide supervision at two levels:
    1) Modality-shared level: Aligns shared representations from all clients to complete prototypes using a Cross-Modal Prototype Regularization loss. Transfers multimodal knowledge.
    2) Modality-specific level: Brings modality-specific representations closer to corresponding class prototypes using a Cross-Modal Prototype Contrastive loss. Enhances generalization.
- A Cross-Modal Alignment loss reduces noise from missing modalities by aligning representations.

Main Contributions:
- First work in MFL to use complete prototypes for handling missing modalities and heterogeneity.
- Proposes MFCPL with three components (CMPR, CMPC, CMA) that enable robust learning using complete prototypes at two representation levels.
- Achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art MFL methods on three datasets. Up to 7.69% improvement on UCI-HAR dataset.
- Ablation studies validate efficacy of each MFCPL component.

In summary, the paper breaks new ground in making MFL robust to missing modalities and heterogeneity via a novel complete prototype approach across representation levels.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel multimodal federated learning framework called MFCPL that handles missing modalities and data heterogeneity by using complete prototypes for alignment at both the modality-specific and modality-shared representation levels along with a cross-modal alignment component.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. They propose a novel multimodal federated learning framework called Multimodal Federated Cross Prototype Learning (MFCPL) to handle the challenges of data heterogeneity and severely missing modalities in multimodal federated learning. 

2. They introduce the concept of "complete prototypes" which aggregates prototypes from clients with different modalities to provide diverse modality knowledge to clients, especially those with missing modalities. The complete prototypes facilitate alignment at two levels - modality-specific representations and modality-shared representations.

3. The MFCPL framework has three main components:
   - Cross-Modal Prototypes Regularization (CMPR) 
   - Cross-Modal Prototypes Contrastive (CMPC)
   - Cross-Modal Alignment (CMA)

4. Through extensive experiments on three multimodal federated datasets, they demonstrate the effectiveness of MFCPL in improving performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially under high rates of missing modalities. The ablation studies also validate the contribution of each component.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the MFCPL framework using complete prototypes to address key challenges of missing modalities and data heterogeneity in multimodal federated learning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Multimodal federated learning (MFL): Learning framework that enables collaborative training of models across clients with multimodal (multiple types of) data while preserving data privacy.

- Missing modalities: Lack of certain data types/modalities for some clients due to hardware or sensor limitations. A key challenge addressed in this paper.

- Complete prototypes: Prototypes aggregated from all available modalities (including partial ones) to provide multimodal knowledge to clients, even those with missing modalities. 

- Cross-modal prototypes regularization (CMPR): Component that aligns local multimodal representations with complete prototypes to transfer knowledge.

- Cross-modal prototypes contrastive (CMPC): Contrastive mechanism to align modality-specific representations of local data with complete prototypes.

- Cross-modal alignment (CMA): Alignment of representations across modalities of local client data to handle missing modalities.

- Data heterogeneity: The variation in feature distributions across different clients, another key challenge.

- Non-IID data: Data that is not independently and identically distributed across clients.

In summary, the key focuses are handling missing modalities and multimodal data heterogeneity in the federated learning setup via complete prototypes and cross-modal alignment techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel concept of "complete prototypes" to tackle missing modalities in multimodal federated learning. How are these complete prototypes constructed and what role do they play in addressing missing modalities?

2. One of the key components proposed is Cross-Modal Prototypes Regularization (CMPR). Explain the intuition behind this component and how it helps provide diverse modality knowledge to clients with missing modalities. 

3. The Cross-Modal Prototypes Contrastive (CMPC) mechanism is utilized in the framework. Elaborate on how this facilitates alignment between complete prototypes and modality-specific representations. What is the motivation behind introducing this?

4. The paper argues that simply imputing missing modalities with zeros can introduce noise. How does the proposed Cross-Modal Alignment (CMA) component help mitigate this? Explain the working of CMA.

5. Compare and contrast the roles of complete prototypes in providing guidance at the modality-specific versus modality-shared representation levels. Which one do you think has a more significant impact and why?

6. How does the overall objective function combine the various components (CMPR, CMPC, CMA)? Explain the need for having three separate alignment mechanisms in the framework.

7. The experiments compare complete prototypes against unimodal prototypes. Analyze these results - why do complete prototypes demonstrate better performance?

8. Examine the results of the ablation study in detail. Which component seems to have the most substantial impact on performance? Provide hypotheses explaining this observation. 

9. The temperature parameter tau is an important hyperparameter. Based on the analysis in section 4.3, what can you conclude about the impact of tau on overall performance?

10. The projection head plays a key role in facilitating alignment at different representation levels. Critically analyze the observations made when varying the projection head dimension. What can you infer about the ideal choice of values?
