# [Japanese-English Sentence Translation Exercises Dataset for Automatic   Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03396)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentence translation exercises (STEs) are useful tools in early stages of L2 language learning, but manually grading them places a heavy burden on teachers. 
- Automating the grading of STEs can transform language learning, but it is a challenging task even for state-of-the-art models.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate STE grading as classifying student responses on each predefined analytic criterion in the grading rubric.
- Created a dataset of 21 STE questions between Japanese and English, with detailed rubrics and 3,498 student responses annotated with scores on each criterion.
- Evaluated performance of finetuned BERT model and GPT models with few-shot learning on this dataset.

Key Contributions:  
- First formulation of automatic STE grading task grounded in educational objectives.
- First STE dataset spanning 21 questions with detailed analytic rubrics and over 3,000 annotated responses.  
- Strong baseline from finetuned BERT, achieving ~90% F1 on classifying correct responses, but weaker performance (<80% F1) on incorrect ones.
- GPT models struggled despite few-shot learning, indicating challenging open problems in this space.

In summary, this paper introduced and established the novel task of automating analytic grading for sentence translation exercises to assist language learning. The formulation, dataset creation, and model evaluations provide a strong foundation while indicating opportunities for advancement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes a new task of automatically grading sentence translation exercises between languages, creates a dataset for Japanese-English translation exercises, and shows that models like BERT and GPT perform reasonably well but still face challenges, indicating room for improvement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Formulating the task of automatic grading of Sentence Translation Exercises (STEs) for educational purposes. This includes formalizing the grading criteria based on educators' intentions and pedagogical objectives.

2) Creating a dataset for this task that contains 21 STE questions between Japanese and English, along with over 3,000 student responses that are annotated with scores and justification cues. This is the first dataset of its kind for STE grading. 

3) Establishing baseline performances on this dataset using models like finetuned BERT and GPTs with few-shot learning. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the task while also showing room for improvement.

In summary, the key contribution is defining and formulating a new task of automatic STE grading for education, creating an initial dataset, and benchmarking performance to set the groundwork for future research. The paper opens up a new research direction at the intersection of education, translation, and evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Sentence translation exercises (STEs): Language learning tools that have learners translate sentences from their native language into a target language. Used to practice specific grammar and vocabulary.

- Automatic grading: Automating the process of grading student's translations in STEs based on predetermined scoring rubrics from educators. Formulated as an analytic score prediction task.  

- Analytic scoring criteria: The detailed scoring rubrics designed by educators that contain multiple independent criteria to evaluate mastery of specific grammar and vocabulary in STE translations.

- Justification cues: Specific phrases identified in student responses that serve as the rationale for assigning an analytic score according to the rubric. Help interpretability.

- Dataset creation: Paper constructs a dataset of STE questions and Japanese-to-English student translations, with analytic scores and justification cues annotated. 

- Baseline models: Evaluated finetuned BERT models and GPT models with few-shot in-context learning on the dataset. Establish initial benchmark for the novel task.

The key focus areas are around developing methods for automatically grading translations in sentence translation exercises between Japanese and English based on explicit educator rubrics, enabled through creation of a new dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes formulating the task of automatic grading of Sentence Translation Exercises (STEs) as scoring each analytic criterion in a rubric. What are some potential limitations or challenges with breaking down the grading task into individual rubric items? How could the overall coherence or meaning of the translation be evaluated?

2. The GPT models struggled to effectively learn from the few-shot examples for scoring criteria, especially for incorrect responses. What modifications could be made to the prompt or examples to better teach the models this specialized task and improve their performance? 

3. The paper collected student responses both from classrooms and crowdworkers. In what ways might these two response pools differ linguistically or stylistically? How might this impact model training or generalization?

4. The inter-annotator agreement scores indicate reliable human performance on scoring, but some variation persisted. What are some potential sources of subjectivity or ambiguity in the rubric items that might lead to discrepancies? 

5. How well would this approach transfer to other language pairs beyond Japanese-English translation exercises? What adaptations would need to be made for linguistically different language pairs?

6. The paper establishes baseline model performance on the dataset. What recent advances in NLP, such as prompt-based tuning methods, might further improve performance on this task?

7. The paper focuses on scoring translation exercises for educational purposes. How might this approach compare to scoring general machine translation quality? What differences would exist?

8. The paper emphasizes the importance of justification cues for providing explanations for the model's scoring decisions. What additional explanation or feedback information would be useful for students and teachers?

9. The data contains a class imbalance between correct and incorrect responses. How might the models' performance depend on the distribution of labels? What resampling or weighting schemes could help?

10. The paper establishes strong baseline methods, but significant room for improvement remains. What performance thresholds or criteria would need to be met before considering real-world deployment for assisting teachers?
