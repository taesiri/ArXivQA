## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Balanced Data, Imbalanced Spectra: Unveiling Class Disparities with Spectral Imbalance":

Problem:
Machine learning models often exhibit significant performance gaps across different classes, even when the training data is balanced across classes. This paper studies the problem of "class bias" and aims to understand its fundamental causes. In particular, it introduces the concept of "spectral imbalance" in the feature representations as a potential source of class disparities. 

Key Ideas:
- The spectrum of a class refers to the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix estimated from the feature representations of samples belonging to that class.  
- The paper hypothesizes that differences or "imbalances" in spectral properties across classes could lead to differences in generalization performance.
- Both theoretical analysis and experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that spectral imbalance correlates strongly with class-dependent performance gaps.

Theoretical Contributions:
- Derives exact asymptotic expressions for the per-class error rates in a Gaussian mixture model setting.
- Uses these to model different types of spectral imbalance between classes and studies their impact on per-class gaps.
- Key factors studied: relative scaling of eigenvalues, alignment of top eigenvectors with class means.

Experimental Contributions:  
- Studies class-spectra of 11 state-of-the-art pretrained models on ImageNet.
- Proposes a "spectral quantile" score to quantify imbalance. Shows it strongly correlates (0.9 PCC) with empirical class gap.
- Demonstrates the score can be used to compare models, predict gaps, and determine better augmentation strategies.
- Develops a simple ensemble technique to combine augmentations and reduce class gap without retraining.

Key Insights:
- Spectral imbalance seems inherent to learned representations and correlates strongly with bias. 
- Understanding the spectral properties provides a new way to diagnose model biases.
- Strategically manipulating spectra could be a path for mitigating class disparities.
