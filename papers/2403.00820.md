# [Retrieval Augmented Generation Systems: Automatic Dataset Creation,   Evaluation and Boolean Agent Setup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge to improve performance. Many different RAG configurations exist but are evaluated mostly on anecdotal evidence. Rigorous quantitative evaluation is lacking.

- Existing datasets for evaluating RAG systems are limited because modern LLMs contain much of Wikipedia and other online sources in their training data. New datasets are needed that contain information beyond an LLM's cutoff date.

- Naive RAG queries a vector database on every user input, which is inefficient for simple questions that can be answered with an LLM's internal knowledge. More sophisticated RAG approaches are needed to conserve tokens.

Proposed Solution:
- A dataset creation workflow to generate Wikipedia articles and questions filtered to be beyond an LLM's cutoff date. Enables automated evaluation.

- An automatic evaluation methodology building on recent work in LLM answer evaluation, using GPT-4 function calls to score truthfulness and relevance.

- A "boolean agent" RAG system where the LLM decides when to query the database. An advanced model triggers retrieval if the LLM thinks its initial answer could be improved.

Main Contributions:
- Rigorous dataset creation and automatic evaluation workflow for quantitatively comparing different RAG strategies

- Implementation and evaluation of a boolean agent RAG system to conserve tokens. Performed well on dataset but unclear if it saves tokens in real applications.

- Created and published dataset suited for RAG evaluation and for further development of token efficient RAG systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a dataset creation and evaluation workflow for quantitatively comparing Retrieval Augmented Generation systems, uses it to develop and evaluate a boolean agent RAG system that decides when to query additional information, and provides recommendations for when such a system can be effectively deployed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Presenting a dataset creation workflow to generate datasets from Wikipedia and other sources that are suited for evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The datasets contain article-question pairs where the articles have information to answer the questions, and the questions are generated to focus on topics beyond a specified LLM's knowledge cutoff point.

2. Showing how to perform automatic evaluation of RAG systems on the created datasets using GPT-4, by scoring truthfulness and relevance of answers.

3. Using a dataset created by their workflow to develop and evaluate a "boolean agent" RAG system, where the LLM decides whether to query the vector database for each user input, aiming to save tokens. They give recommendations for when this boolean RAG setup could conserve tokens without compromising performance.

4. Publishing their code and datasets to allow further research and development of RAG systems.

In summary, the main contribution is the rigorous dataset creation and evaluation workflow to quantitatively compare different RAG strategies. The boolean agent RAG system is one example application that is developed and analyzed using this workflow.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an automatic dataset creation workflow to generate datasets from Wikipedia specifically for evaluating RAG systems. Can you explain in detail the steps involved in this workflow and how it ensures that the dataset contains information beyond the LLM's cutoff date?

2. The paper evaluates different baseline tests without using RAG on the generated datasets. Can you analyze the results of these baseline tests and explain why the drop in performance from dataset A_d to A_f is smaller than expected? 

3. The paper uses GPT-4's function calling API to automatically evaluate the truthfulness and relevance of LLM generated answers. Can you explain why fluency is no longer evaluated and how the asymmetry in knowledge between question answerer and evaluator is addressed?

4. Explain in detail the issues faced in setting up a basic Boolean Agent RAG system and why a simple true/false token to decide on retrieval does not work effectively.

5. The advanced Boolean Agent RAG system proposed generates a baseline answer first before deciding on retrieval. Analyze how this approach addresses the limitations of the basic setup.

6. Compare the performance and token usage of naive RAG versus advanced boolean agent RAG quantitatively on both dataset A_r and A_f. Is there a clear better approach?

7. Under what circumstances can advanced boolean agent RAG be deployed to save tokens without compromising performance compared to naive RAG? 

8. The paper proposes the usage of cheaper LLMs for the baseline answering and decision steps in boolean agent RAG. Analyze the tradeoffs involved in this approach.

9. Can the advanced boolean agent RAG approach be improved further through better prompting techniques? Explain your view.

10. The paper publishes the created datasets and challenges the research community to enhance boolean agent RAG configurations. What specific aspects of boolean agent RAG should the community focus on improving?
