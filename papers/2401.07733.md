# [Conformal Approach To Gaussian Process Surrogate Evaluation With   Coverage Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Gaussian process (GP) metamodels are widely used for uncertainty quantification of expensive computer simulations. They provide a mean predictor and posterior variance for uncertainty estimates. 
- Reliability of GP predictions and credibility intervals depends on correct model assumptions and prior specification, which are not always appropriate in practice.
- There is a need for additional techniques to evaluate GP surrogate model quality and assist in choosing good priors for specific applications.

Proposed Solution:
- Use conformal prediction (CP) methods to obtain distribution-free prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage for GP metamodels. 
- Adapt the cross-conformal Jackknife+ method by defining a Gaussian non-conformity score weighted by GP posterior standard deviation raised to a power β.  
- Proposed "J+GP" intervals achieve theoretical marginal coverage ≥ 1 - 2α like Jackknife+ and adaptivity through dependence on local GP uncertainty.

Contributions:
- Definition of new Gaussian non-conformity score for cross-CP tailored to GPs.  
- J+GP intervals that are adaptive and have coverage guarantees without distributional assumptions.
- Methodology to quantify interval adaptivity using correlation between width and metamodel error.
- Numerical studies showing J+GP outperforms GP credibility intervals and standard CP methods in terms of adaptivity and average width.
- Demonstrated model selection capabilities based on coverage, width and correlation metrics for choosing good GP priors.
- Application to industrial simulator highlights usefulness for assessing GP surrogate quality.

In summary, the key innovation is a cross-CP method leveraging GP uncertainty estimates to obtain adaptive prediction sets that can reliably evaluate GP metamodel quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to construct adaptive prediction intervals for Gaussian process regression models using cross-conformal prediction, allowing for model validation and selection while providing coverage guarantees without relying on distributional assumptions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to construct adaptive conformal prediction intervals for Gaussian process regression that can assist in evaluating the quality and reliability of GP surrogate models. Specifically, the paper:

1) Introduces a non-conformity score tailored for GPs to be used within the cross-conformal Jackknife+ paradigm to derive adaptive prediction intervals called "J+GP" and "J-minmax-GP" with theoretical coverage guarantees. 

2) Demonstrates that the interval widths from these methods are interpretable as a proxy for GP prediction precision/uncertainty and show significant correlation with the actual GP approximation errors.

3) Shows that the proposed intervals can help discriminate between different choices of GP kernels/priors to select the optimal one. 

4) Provides a methodology and code implementation for using these intervals to robustify and enhance GP validation in the context of surrogate modeling and uncertainty quantification.

In summary, the key innovation is in conformalizing GPs to construct adaptive prediction sets that can serve as indicators of the reliability of the GP metamodel itself. This allows more informed model selection and quality assessment.
