# [Enhancing Texture Generation with High-Fidelity Using Advanced Texture   Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in AI for 2D image generation have sparked interest in using 2D priors to assist 3D shape and texture generation. However, these methods often overlook subsequent user operations like mesh simplification which lead to texture aliasing and blurring. 
- Traditional graphics methods only partially address this, and recent neural texture synthesis methods fail to ensure consistency with original appearance and struggle with noise when generating high-resolution textures.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage approach - first reconstruct 3D geometry from a single image to allow user editing like mesh simplification, then conduct high-fidelity texture restoration on the edited geometry.
- Stage 1: Recover geometry using a modified Wonder3D method with added depth supervision for more robust reconstruction. Allows user editing of mesh.  
- Stage 2: Use edited mesh and texture as input to Depth2Image model to generate multi-view RGB images. Project these onto texture map using UV mapping for optimization via gradient descent.  

Key Contributions:
- Uses user's edited rough texture as initialization to enhance consistency and controllability compared to generating textures from scratch.
- Introduces self-supervised dual-optimization of low-res and high-res textures to eliminate noise issues in high-res synthesis.  
- Overall, enables high-fidelity, high-quality texture restoration after user edits like mesh simplification, while solving issues like blurring and noise that affect other state-of-the-art neural texture synthesis methods.

In summary, the key novelty is in using user-edited textures as initialization for high-fidelity neural restoration, combined with a self-supervised approach to enable high-quality high-resolution outputs.
