# [Common Pets in 3D: Dynamic New-View Synthesis of Real-Life Deformable   Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03889)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How can we perform high-quality new view synthesis of deformable objects like cats and dogs from only sparse input views, by learning category-level priors from videos?

The key hypotheses of the paper are:

1) It is possible to reconstruct deformable objects from sparse views if one leverages strong category-level priors learned from a large collection of videos of objects from the same category.

2) Modeling the trajectories of points over time is important to enable the reconstruction of deforming objects.

3) A method like their proposed TrackeRF can effectively learn such category-level shape and motion priors from videos and apply them at test time to reconstruct new objects from sparse views by predicting trajectories of points.

To summarize, the central research question is how to do high-quality reconstruction of deformable objects from sparse views using learned category-level shape and motion priors. The key hypotheses are that this is possible by modeling trajectories of points over time and that their proposed TrackeRF method can effectively learn and apply such priors.
