# [PaD: Program-aided Distillation Specializes Large Models in Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13888)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is using program-aided distillation to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) to smaller models. The authors propose synthesizing program-aided reasoning data from LLMs and then fine-tuning smaller models on this data to distill reasoning skills. The central hypothesis is that program-aided distillation can enable smaller models to achieve strong performance on reasoning tasks while being much more efficient in terms of model size and data requirements compared to prior distillation methods based on chain-of-thought reasoning.Specifically, the paper investigates whether program-aided distillation can:- Produce small models that match or exceed the reasoning performance of large models on math word problems, despite using significantly fewer parameters. - Achieve better data efficiency and training efficiency compared to prior distillation methods that use chain-of-thought reasoning data.- Overcome issues with faulty reasoning that can arise when using synthetic chain-of-thought data from LLMs.The experiments aim to validate whether program-aided distillation can effectively transfer reasoning skills to small models in a highly parameter and data efficient manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a novel method called Program-aided Distillation (PaD) to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) to smaller models. PaD generates synthetic reasoning program data from LLMs and uses it to fine-tune smaller models. 2. PaD can automatically filter out faulty reasoning samples from the synthetic data using a Python interpreter, which improves the quality of the fine-tuning data.3. Empirical results show that the smaller models fine-tuned via PaD can match or exceed the reasoning performance of certain larger LLMs on math word problems, while using significantly fewer parameters and less data.4. Analysis indicates that PaD increases training efficiency and is well-suited for smaller models. With only half the data size, it achieves comparable grammatical accuracy to an advanced LLM.5. The paper establishes state-of-the-art results on teaching reasoning skills to small models, despite using a model 11x smaller and data 3x smaller than prior work.In summary, the core contribution appears to be proposing PaD as an effective distillation method to transfer reasoning abilities from large to small models, while needing less data and compute resources. The empirical results demonstrate the advantages of PaD for specialized small models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other related work:- The use of program-aided reasoning data is a novel approach compared to prior work using chain-of-thought or other rationales. Automatic error checking by executing the programs enables higher quality data for training small models. This contributes a new technique for knowledge distillation.- Results show the proposed method enables more efficient training and better performance from small models on reasoning tasks, using less data and compute. The 0.06B model surpasses certain larger models like LLaMA and PaLM on the GSM8K benchmark. This is a significant advance in getting good reasoning ability out of smaller models.- Most prior work focused on distilling generic capabilities from large models. This paper specifically targets distilling reasoning skills. The specialized models gain big improvements on math reasoning benchmarks but decline on general tasks. This tradeoff is expected with smaller models but hasn't been explored as much for reasoning.- Comparing data efficiency, PaD gets a 10% gain over baselines while using only 1/3 of the data and 1/11 of the parameters. Analyses also show it can match performance with 50% less data. So it makes better use of limited resources.- The simplicity of generating programs vs freeform text appears to be an advantage for small models. The authors argue this narrows the prediction space to focus learning on reasoning rather than explanation. Experiments support program-aided reasoning being more suitable for small models.In summary, this paper pushes forward techniques for knowledge distillation to reasoning tasks specifically, and provides both empirical gains and analysis to advance understanding of how to effectively train small models. The distillation recipe enables new capabilities for low-resource reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more efficient methods for distilling knowledge from large language models into smaller, more specialized models. The authors propose program-aided distillation as one approach, but suggest exploring other techniques as well.- Further analysis and improvement of the training efficiency and data efficiency of distillation methods like program-aided distillation. The authors show PaD can achieve good performance with less data, but more work could be done to optimize the data and training.- Testing program-aided distillation on other specialized tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as scientific reasoning, logistical reasoning, etc. The general framework could potentially be applied to other reasoning domains.- Exploring other simplified and regular reasoning formats beyond programs, such as formal logic representations, knowledge graphs, etc. The key is finding representations that simplify the reasoning process for smaller models.- Mitigating the trade-off between specialization and generalization ability when distilling knowledge into smaller models. Techniques to retain more general capabilities while still specializing could be helpful.- Developing methods to leverage multiple teacher models and combine their knowledge effectively during distillation. This could provide complementary knowledge to further improve the student models.- Exploring distillation techniques that can work with black-box large language models without requiring access to the model internals. Much of the value is in proprietary closed models like GPT-3.In summary, the main directions are improving the efficiency and generalization of knowledge distillation techniques, exploring alternative reasoning formats, and developing methods that work in real-world settings with large black-box teacher models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called Program-aided Distillation (PaD) to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) to smaller models. PaD works by using LLMs to synthesize program-based reasoning data, which is then filtered by a Python interpreter to remove any faulty reasoning samples. This filtered data is used to fine-tune the smaller model. By representing the reasoning as programs rather than free-form text, PaD simplifies the task for the small model so it can focus on learning to reason rather than explain its reasoning. Experiments on arithmetic reasoning datasets show that a 60M parameter model fine-tuned with PaD matches or exceeds the performance of larger models like LLaMA (13B parameters) and PaLM (60B parameters). Compared to prior work on distilling reasoning abilities, PaD achieves state-of-the-art results while using far less data and much smaller models. The tradeoff is that the specialized small models lose some of their general capabilities on broader NLP tasks. Overall, PaD provides an effective way to transfer reasoning skills from large, expensive LLMs to small, practical models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Program-aided Distillation (PaD), a novel approach to distill knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller specialized models that are improved at mathematical reasoning. The key idea is to synthesize program-based reasoning data from LLMs, and use this to fine-tune smaller models. The synthesized programs act as explanations for the reasoning steps, and can be automatically checked for errors using a Python interpreter. This allows filtering of incorrect reasoning data before fine-tuning, improving the quality of the training data. The authors conduct extensive experiments on arithmetic reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate that small models fine-tuned with PaD can surpass certain larger models like LLaMA and PaLM on benchmarks like GSM8K. Compared to prior specialized model baselines, PaD achieves over 10% higher accuracy on GSM8K, using a model 10x smaller and 3x less data. Analyses reveal the efficiency of PaD - it attains accuracy comparable to advanced models like GPT-3.5 using only 50% as much data. Overall, PaD enables specialized small models to achieve reasoning abilities comparable to larger models, in a significantly more efficient manner. The simplified program-based reasoning format is more suitable for smaller models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach called Program-aided Distillation (PaD) to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) to smaller models. The key idea is to synthesize program-aided reasoning data from LLMs using in-context learning, where the LLM generates Python code representing the reasoning steps given example context. This synthetic data is used to fine-tune the smaller model. A key advantage of the program-aided reasoning format is that the code can be automatically checked for errors using a Python interpreter, allowing faulty reasoning samples to be filtered out of the training data. This results in higher quality training data. Additionally, by generating reasoning in code format rather than natural language, the method simplifies the task for the smaller model to focus on logic rather than language generation. Experiments across several math reasoning datasets show that small models fine-tuned with PaD can match or exceed the performance of larger pretrained models, while using far fewer parameters and less data. However, there is a tradeoff in terms of reduced performance on general domain tasks. Overall, PaD provides an effective way to specialize small models for reasoning via distillation from LLMs.
