# Automatically Select Emotion for Response via Personality-affected   Emotion Transition

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How to automatically select appropriate emotions for dialog system responses in conversations, considering the individual differences in emotion expressions?The key points are:- The paper proposes a new perspective to enable dialog systems to automatically select emotions for responses through modeling the personality-affected emotion transition, simulating how human emotions transition from one state to another in conversations. - It argues that existing methods either focus on rendering specified emotions or empathetic responses, but overlook the individual differences in emotion expressions. This may lead to inconsistent emotional interactions. - The proposed method models the emotion transition as the variation from the preceding emotion to the response emotion in the VAD space. The transition is affected by the dialog context and the specified personality trait.- The paper constructs a dialog dataset PELD with emotion and personality labels. Experiments on emotion prediction tasks validate the effectiveness of modeling personality-affected emotion transitions.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by modeling the personality-affected emotion transition, the dialog system can automatically select appropriate emotions for responses like humans, while considering individual differences in emotion expressions. The experiments on the constructed dataset provide validation for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel personality-affected emotion transition model to enable dialog systems to automatically select appropriate emotions for responses. Specifically:- It raises the problem of automatically selecting emotions for responses in dialog systems, which is important for consistent emotional interaction but often overlooked in prior works. - It proposes modeling emotion selection as a personality-affected emotion transition process. The idea is to simulate how human emotions transition from one state to another in conversation, which is influenced by individual personality differences.- It designs a neural architecture to implement the proposed personality-affected emotion transition model. The model encodes dialog context and specified personality traits to generate emotion variations in the VAD space, which are used to select the response emotion.- It constructs a new dialog dataset called PELD, which contains over 6500 dialog triples with emotion and personality annotations. This facilitates research on modeling personality and emotions in dialog systems.- It conducts experiments on emotion prediction tasks using PELD, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling personality-affected emotion transitions for automatic emotion selection in dialog systems.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel perspective and model architecture to enable dialog systems to automatically select emotions by simulating personality-influenced emotion transitions, like how humans transition emotions in conversations. The constructed dataset and empirical evaluations further validate the utility of this idea.
