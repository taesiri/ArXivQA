# [Automatically Select Emotion for Response via Personality-affected   Emotion Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15846)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How to automatically select appropriate emotions for dialog system responses in conversations, considering the individual differences in emotion expressions?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new perspective to enable dialog systems to automatically select emotions for responses through modeling the personality-affected emotion transition, simulating how human emotions transition from one state to another in conversations. 

- It argues that existing methods either focus on rendering specified emotions or empathetic responses, but overlook the individual differences in emotion expressions. This may lead to inconsistent emotional interactions. 

- The proposed method models the emotion transition as the variation from the preceding emotion to the response emotion in the VAD space. The transition is affected by the dialog context and the specified personality trait.

- The paper constructs a dialog dataset PELD with emotion and personality labels. Experiments on emotion prediction tasks validate the effectiveness of modeling personality-affected emotion transitions.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by modeling the personality-affected emotion transition, the dialog system can automatically select appropriate emotions for responses like humans, while considering individual differences in emotion expressions. The experiments on the constructed dataset provide validation for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel personality-affected emotion transition model to enable dialog systems to automatically select appropriate emotions for responses. Specifically:

- It raises the problem of automatically selecting emotions for responses in dialog systems, which is important for consistent emotional interaction but often overlooked in prior works. 

- It proposes modeling emotion selection as a personality-affected emotion transition process. The idea is to simulate how human emotions transition from one state to another in conversation, which is influenced by individual personality differences.

- It designs a neural architecture to implement the proposed personality-affected emotion transition model. The model encodes dialog context and specified personality traits to generate emotion variations in the VAD space, which are used to select the response emotion.

- It constructs a new dialog dataset called PELD, which contains over 6500 dialog triples with emotion and personality annotations. This facilitates research on modeling personality and emotions in dialog systems.

- It conducts experiments on emotion prediction tasks using PELD, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling personality-affected emotion transitions for automatic emotion selection in dialog systems.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel perspective and model architecture to enable dialog systems to automatically select emotions by simulating personality-influenced emotion transitions, like how humans transition emotions in conversations. The constructed dataset and empirical evaluations further validate the utility of this idea.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a personality-affected emotion transition model to enable dialog systems to automatically select emotions for responses by modeling how a specified personality trait influences the transition from the preceding emotion to the response emotion based on the dialog context.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate personality effects on emotions in multi-modality scenarios. The paper notes that facial expressions, voices, gestures etc. also play an important role in emotional interaction, but they are not captured in purely text-based dialog systems. The authors suggest continuing to study personality effects in settings that incorporate multiple modalities beyond just text.

- Improve handling of subtle affective information. The authors note that the most common emotion in their dialog dataset is still neutral, likely because subtle affective information is not captured well in text. They suggest future work on better capturing this subtle affective information, whether through multi-modality or improved textual analysis.

- Integrate the personality-affected emotion transition model with response generation. The authors suggest combining their emotion selection model with actual response generation, to have a fully functioning dialog system.

- Expand the personality-affected emotion transition model to multi-turn conversations. The current model looks at emotion transitions between two utterances, but the authors suggest expanding it to model long-term consistent emotions over multiple turns in a conversation.

- Handle emotion prediction error accumulation in multi-turn dialogues. Related to the previous point, the authors note a challenge of prediction errors accumulating over multiple turns, and suggest investigating ways to address this issue.

- Construct larger datasets. The authors note their dataset is relatively small. They suggest constructing larger datasets annotated with personality and emotion information to continue improving emotion selection models.

In summary, the main future directions are: multi-modality emotion modeling, capturing subtle affective signals, integrating with response generation, expanding to multi-turn dialogues, addressing error accumulation, and constructing larger datasets. The key themes seem to be improving emotion modeling through multi-modality and via larger datasets, and expanding the current model to fully-functioning multi-turn dialog systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to enable dialog systems to automatically select emotions for responses by simulating human emotion transitions in conversations. The key idea is to model the emotion transition of the dialog system as a variation from its preceding emotion to the next emotion, affected by its specified personality traits. The emotion transition is represented as changes in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. Neural networks are designed to encode the preceding dialog context and personality traits to generate the emotion transition variation in VAD space. The final response emotion is selected by combining the preceding emotion vector and the variation vector. The paper also introduces a new dialog dataset called PELD with emotion and personality labels. Experiments on emotion prediction tasks demonstrate improved performance with the proposed personality-affected emotion transition model compared to baselines. Overall, the paper presents a novel perspective to incorporate personality modeling and simulate human-like emotion transitions in dialog systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to enable dialog systems to automatically select appropriate emotions for responses, simulating human emotional interactions. The key idea is to model the emotion transition of the dialog system from its preceding emotion based on the dialog context and a specified personality trait. Specifically, the emotion transition is represented as a variation in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. Neural networks encode the dialog context and personality trait to compose this variation, which is added to the preceding emotion to obtain the response emotion. 

To facilitate research, the authors construct a dataset called PELD containing dialog triples from Friends transcripts with emotion and personality labels. Experiments on emotion prediction tasks demonstrate improved performance using the proposed personality-affected emotion transition model compared to baseline methods. The results validate modeling individual differences in emotional expressions through personality-based emotion transitions. Overall, this work provides a new perspective for equipping dialog systems with personalized emotional intelligence.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a personality-affected emotion transition model to enable dialog systems to automatically select emotions for responses. The main idea is to model the emotion transition process in dialog systems similar to humans - the next emotion is transitioned from the preceding emotion, triggered by the dialog context, and affected by the personality of the speaker. 

Specifically, the emotion transition is modeled as the variation from the preceding emotion vector to the next emotion vector in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. The personality traits of speakers are also projected into the VAD space based on psychology research. Neural networks are then designed to encode the dialog context into VAD variations, which are weighted by the personality VAD vectors to compose the final emotion transition. The next emotion is selected based on the sum of the preceding emotion and the weighted VAD variations.

In summary, the key method is using the VAD emotion space to model personality-affected emotion transitions, where the dialog context triggers the transition and the personality affects the transition process. This simulates how humans select emotions in dialogues based on context and their personalities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons of this paper to other research on emotional dialogue systems:

- This paper focuses on automatically selecting an appropriate emotion for the system's response, rather than rendering a specified emotion or empathetically responding to the user as in prior work.  The authors argue that automatically selecting emotions is critical for simulating human-like conversations but has been relatively unexplored.

- The paper proposes modeling emotion selection as a personality-affected emotion transition, drawing inspiration from psychology research showing personality influences emotional expressions. This incorporates individual differences rather than training on masses of data.

- The authors construct a new dataset called PELD with annotated emotions and speaker personalities extracted from Friends dialogs. Many prior emotional dialog datasets lack speaker personality information.

- Evaluations are done via emotion prediction rather than end-to-end dialog. This prediction task is claimed to be challenging as the response content itself is unknown.

- Their proposed model encoding personality and dialog context into an emotion transition shows improved prediction accuracy over baselines, demonstrating the utility of the personality-affected perspective.

- The personality-affected emotion transition approach is novel to conversational AI. Prior work has modeled transitions in non-conversational settings or for facial expressions in human-robot interaction.

In summary, this paper makes a novel contribution in modeling emotion selection for dialog systems using speaker personality and psychology-inspired emotion transitions. The constructed PELD dataset and evaluations on emotion prediction tasks demonstrate the promise of this approach compared to prior work focused on rendering specified emotions or empathy.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting appropriate emotions for dialog system responses, considering individual differences in emotion expression. Most prior work focuses on rendering specified emotions or empathetic responses, but not on how to automatically select suitable emotions.

- The paper proposes modeling emotion selection as a personality-affected emotion transition process. The idea is to transition the dialog system's emotion state from its previous emotion based on the dialog context and its specified personality.  

- The emotion transition is modeled as a variation in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. Neural networks encode the dialog context and personality to compute this variation, which is applied to the previous emotion to obtain the next emotion.

- The paper constructs a new dialog dataset called PELD, containing over 6k dialog triples with emotion and personality labels. Experiments on emotion prediction tasks demonstrate the proposed personality-affected emotion transition method improves performance.

In summary, the key problem is automatically selecting suitable emotions for dialog responses rather than just rendering specified emotions. The proposed solution is to model it as a personality-based emotion state transition process, validated through experiments on the new PELD dataset.
