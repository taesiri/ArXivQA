# [Unsupervised Enrichment of Persona-grounded Dialog with Background   Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to make persona-grounded dialog systems generate more engaging and human-like responses. 

The key hypothesis is that enriching the persona of dialog agents with relevant background stories, drawn from existing story corpora, will allow them to produce more interesting and specific responses in conversations.

Specifically, the paper proposes an unsupervised method to:

1) Retrieve stories relevant to a given persona from an existing story dataset.

2) Adapt the retrieved story into a fluent dialog response using gradient-based rewriting. This encourages the adapted response to be fluent with the dialog context, consistent with the original persona, and minimally different from the retrieved story.

The underlying hypothesis is that leveraging external story data in this way will allow persona-grounded dialog systems to generate more engaging, narrative responses compared to existing models. The human evaluation results appear to confirm this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method to enrich persona-grounded dialog models with relevant background stories by retrieving narratives from existing story datasets. The key ideas are:

- Retrieving stories from a corpus (e.g. ROCStories) that are relevant to a given dialog agent's persona. 

- Performing unsupervised adaptation of the retrieved story to generate a response that is fluent with the dialog context using a gradient-based inference technique. 

- Incorporating loss terms during gradient-based decoding to encourage consistency with the persona and minimal divergence from the original retrieved story.

- Demonstrating through automatic and human evaluations that the proposed approach leads to more engaging and human-like responses compared to existing dialog models.

The main novelty is being able to adapt external non-conversational stories to enrich dialog agents without access to any supervised data containing such narrative responses. This is done in a completely unsupervised manner through the proposed gradient-based decoding technique.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised method to make persona-grounded dialog models generate more engaging responses by retrieving relevant background stories from existing story datasets and adapting them to the dialog context using gradient-based rewriting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on enriching persona-grounded dialog:

- The key novelty is using external story datasets in an unsupervised way to provide more detailed and engaging responses related to a persona. This is different from most prior work which has focused on improving diversity through decoding strategies, training objectives, or using in-domain external data. 

- Retrieving relevant stories and adapting them to be fluent responses is an interesting idea. The proposed unsupervised gradient-based decoding technique is also novel, as most past work has relied on training with external non-dialog corpora through pseudo-labeling or multi-task learning.

- The idea of enriching limited persona descriptions with external content is promising. Prior work has tried to expand personas with commonsense knowledge bases which helps, but detailed story-like responses seem more engaging.

- The automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the proposed approach can generate more diverse and engaging responses compared to existing persona-based models.

- One limitation is the assumption that a story needs to be incorporated at every turn, whereas a more nuanced policy may help. The technique also seems English-centric currently.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel way of leveraging external story data in an unsupervised manner to provide richer persona-based responses. The proposed decoding approach and evaluations are interesting. It helps address a major gap in existing dialog models to produce detailed experience-based responses.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Handling follow-up questions from the user about details of a background story. They note that not all details may be present in the retrieved story, so expanding the story in a consistent way when the user asks for more specifics could be beneficial.

- Incorporating a decision step to determine if a background story is needed at a particular turn in the dialog, rather than assuming one is always needed. 

- Using retrieved stories over multiple turns of dialog instead of just a single turn. This could allow for more natural continuation and elaboration on story details.

- Evaluating the approach on dialog datasets in other languages besides English.

- Exploring different story datasets as sources of background stories and analyzing the biases that may be present in them.

Overall, the main future directions seem to be around making the incorporation of background stories into dialog more natural and context-aware, expanding the stories over multiple turns, testing the approach in new domains/languages, and analyzing potential biases in the story datasets used. The authors propose several interesting ways to build on this initial work on enriching persona-based dialog with narratives.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach to enrich dialog agent personas with relevant backstories by leveraging existing non-conversational story datasets like ROCStories. Since current dialog datasets lack detailed narrative responses, the authors perform unsupervised adaptation of a retrieved story to generate a dialog response using gradient-based rewriting. Their proposed decoding method encourages the generated response to be fluent with the dialog history, minimally different from the retrieved story to preserve event ordering, and consistent with the original persona. Experiments demonstrate that their approach generates more diverse, engaging, and human-like responses compared to existing persona-grounded dialog models, which often lack the capability to produce narrative responses detailing experiences relevant to the persona. The unsupervised story adaptation fills an important gap in current dialog models' ability to produce richer and more interesting conversational responses.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to enrich persona-grounded dialog models with relevant background stories, in order to generate more engaging and human-like responses. Existing dialog models often lack the ability to refer to detailed experiences or events related to a persona, resulting in dull conversations. To address this, the authors leverage external story datasets such as ROCStories to retrieve fictional narratives relevant to a given persona. Since dialog datasets do not contain such narrative responses, they perform unsupervised adaptation of the retrieved story into a fluent dialog response using gradient-based rewriting. 

Specifically, the decoding procedure encourages the generated response to be fluent with the dialog history, minimally different from the retrieved story to preserve event ordering, and consistent with the original persona. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more diverse responses that human evaluators find more engaging and human-like compared to a number of baseline dialog models. The work provides a novel way to equip dialog systems with relevant background stories, without requiring explicit story responses in the training data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel method to enrich persona-grounded dialog systems with background stories by leveraging existing story datasets like ROCStories. The key idea is to retrieve a relevant story from the story dataset based on the persona, and then adapt it to generate a response that fits the dialog context. Since dialog datasets lack such detailed narrative responses, they perform this adaptation in an unsupervised manner using gradient-based decoding. Specifically, during decoding they optimize for three objectives - the response should be fluent with the dialog history, minimally different from the retrieved story to preserve event ordering, and consistent with the original persona. The fluency with dialog history comes from the likelihood of the left-to-right causal language model. The other two objectives are incorporated by iteratively updating the decoder output distribution using gradients from a backward pass. This allows generating detailed narrative responses without requiring explicit supervision. Experiments show the approach leads to more diverse and engaging responses compared to existing dialog models.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key ideas from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach to enrich persona-grounded dialog models with background stories in order to generate more engaging and interesting responses. The key idea is to retrieve relevant narrative stories from existing corpora and incorporate them into the dialog response using an unsupervised gradient-based decoding technique. Specifically, given a dialog history and persona, they first retrieve a relevant story using BERT-score based similarity. Since the retrieved story may not fit the dialog context directly, they perform iterative gradient-based decoding to encourage the response to be 1) fluent with the dialog history, 2) minimally different from the retrieved story, and 3) consistent with the original persona. The consistency is enforced via a classifier predicting entailment between the persona and response. Their unsupervised approach works at test time without requiring additional training. Experiments on the PersonaChat dataset demonstrate that their technique results in more diverse, engaging, and human-like responses compared to existing models. The key contributions are the novel idea of enriching personas with background stories and the unsupervised gradient-based decoding approach to incorporate them at test time to generate more specific and interesting responses.
