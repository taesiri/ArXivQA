# Unsupervised Enrichment of Persona-grounded Dialog with Background   Stories

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to make persona-grounded dialog systems generate more engaging and human-like responses. The key hypothesis is that enriching the persona of dialog agents with relevant background stories, drawn from existing story corpora, will allow them to produce more interesting and specific responses in conversations.Specifically, the paper proposes an unsupervised method to:1) Retrieve stories relevant to a given persona from an existing story dataset.2) Adapt the retrieved story into a fluent dialog response using gradient-based rewriting. This encourages the adapted response to be fluent with the dialog context, consistent with the original persona, and minimally different from the retrieved story.The underlying hypothesis is that leveraging external story data in this way will allow persona-grounded dialog systems to generate more engaging, narrative responses compared to existing models. The human evaluation results appear to confirm this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method to enrich persona-grounded dialog models with relevant background stories by retrieving narratives from existing story datasets. The key ideas are:- Retrieving stories from a corpus (e.g. ROCStories) that are relevant to a given dialog agent's persona. - Performing unsupervised adaptation of the retrieved story to generate a response that is fluent with the dialog context using a gradient-based inference technique. - Incorporating loss terms during gradient-based decoding to encourage consistency with the persona and minimal divergence from the original retrieved story.- Demonstrating through automatic and human evaluations that the proposed approach leads to more engaging and human-like responses compared to existing dialog models.The main novelty is being able to adapt external non-conversational stories to enrich dialog agents without access to any supervised data containing such narrative responses. This is done in a completely unsupervised manner through the proposed gradient-based decoding technique.
