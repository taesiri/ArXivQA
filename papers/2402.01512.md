# [Distractor Generation for Multiple-Choice Questions: A Survey of   Methods, Datasets, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01512)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Distractor generation (DG) is an important but time-consuming task in creating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for assessments. DG involves generating plausible but incorrect answer options called distractors. There has been growing research interest in automating DG, but no comprehensive literature review exists on DG tasks, datasets, and evaluation methods. 

Solution:
This paper provides the first survey on distractor generation for MCQs. It reviews the recent research on DG, analyzes DG datasets, and summarizes evaluation metrics. The authors categorize DG tasks into three groups - cloze DG, reading comprehension DG, and multimodal DG.

Key Points:

- Cloze DG focuses on generating distractors for fill-in-the-blank questions. Recent approaches use contextualized language models like BERT.

- Reading comprehension DG aims to generate distractors for passage-based questions. Methods range from RNNs to transformers like T5.

- Multimodal DG creates distractors for visual question answering using images/videos. Only one recent work exists using adversarial networks.

- Analysis of 33 DG datasets shows over half are text-based, human-generated questions from educational sources. There is a lack of open-domain and multimodal datasets.

- Evaluation metrics for DG include both automatic (BLEU, BERT score) and human assessments (plausibility, fluency) of distractor quality.

Main Contributions:

- First comprehensive literature review of distractor generation tasks, datasets, and evaluations

- Taxonomy of DG tasks across textual and multimodal contexts  

- Thorough analysis of MCQ datasets and components in DG research

- Summary of key metrics used to evaluate quality of generated distractors

The paper provides a solid overview of progress and open challenges in automated distractor generation. It can inform future research directions in this important educational application of NLP.
