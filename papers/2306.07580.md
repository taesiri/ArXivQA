# [SayTap: Language to Quadrupedal Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07580)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an interactive system that enables quadrupedal robots to respond to natural language instructions from humans in a flexible way?More specifically, the authors aim to address the challenge of translating high-level natural language commands into low-level control signals for quadrupedal robots. To bridge this gap, they propose using foot contact patterns as an interface between the natural language instructions and the locomotion controller. The key hypothesis appears to be that foot contact patterns can serve as a natural and flexible intermediate representation for quadrupedal locomotion. By training a locomotion controller to realize desired foot contact patterns, and an LLM to generate these patterns from natural language, they hypothesize they can develop an interactive system that allows users to craft diverse locomotion behaviors through free-form language commands.The paper seems focused on investigating whether foot contact patterns are indeed an effective interface, superior to other choices like discrete gaits or sinusoidal functions. It also aims to demonstrate that the overall pipeline - language to patterns to control - can work on real quadrupedal robots.In summary, the central research question revolves around using foot contact patterns to bridge natural language and low-level control for interactive quadrupedal robots. The key hypothesis is that contact patterns are a natural interface well-suited for this task.
