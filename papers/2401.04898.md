# [ANGO: A Next-Level Evaluation Benchmark For Generation-Oriented Language   Models In Chinese Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04898)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Existing Chinese language model evaluation benchmarks have limitations such as distorted rankings, difficulty in analyzing model capabilities, challenges with updating testsets, and subject-based categories that fail to capture questions requiring multiple skillsets.

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces ANGO, a new Chinese multiple-choice question benchmark aimed at addressing these limitations. Key features of ANGO include:

- Keypoint categorization: Classifies questions based on required capabilities (171 keypoints across 5 categories) rather than just subject. Allows single questions to have multiple keypoints.

- Quantifiable difficulty: Measures question difficulty based on human performance data and assigns questions to 9 difficulty levels, enabling more precise assessment.  

- Sampling strategies: Customized strategies for few-shot examples and testset sampling to enable rapid iteration and minimize information loss.

Main Contributions:

- Provides more comprehensive, multi-level evaluation results across keypoints and difficulty grades. Enables better analysis of model capabilities.

- Addresses common issues with testsets becoming outdated. Framework supports periodic testset updates to prevent data leaks.

- Introduces new evaluation metrics - "Human Value" and "Human Hit" - to assess human-like behaviors and value in model failures. 

- Testset poses stronger challenge to models compared to prior Chinese benchmarks based on experiments. Reveals performance issues for English models on Chinese linguistic features.

Overall, ANGO pushes forward Chinese benchmarking through innovative design that enables more accurate, robust, and interpretable evaluation of large language models. The proposed solutions help mitigate key issues plaguing existing benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces ANGO, a new Chinese multi-choice question evaluation benchmark for language models that proposes keypoint categorization, quantifiable question difficulty levels, and optimized sampling and evaluation strategies to provide more comprehensive, accurate, and robust model assessments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces ANGO, a new Chinese multi-choice question evaluation benchmark for assessing generation-oriented language models. 

2. It proposes the use of "keypoints" instead of "subjects" to categorize questions, allowing a single question to correspond to multiple keypoints and providing more detailed evaluation results. 

3. It establishes a quantifiable question difficulty measurement based on real human performance, dividing questions into 9 difficulty levels to better guide model training.

4. It designs sampling strategies and an evaluation framework that support rapid testset updates to minimize data leakage issues.

In summary, ANGO aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate benchmark for evaluating Chinese language models, with innovative features like multi-level keypoints, quantifiable difficulty scoring, and dynamic testset iteration to ensure fairness and effectiveness. The goal is to better analyze model capabilities and guide further improvements.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the content of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- ANGO - The name of the proposed Chinese multi-choice question evaluation benchmark introduced in the paper.

- Keypoints - The paper proposes categorizing questions based on "keypoints" rather than just subject matter. Keypoints refer to the specific skills and capabilities needed to answer a question. 

- Difficulty levels - The paper quantifies question difficulty into 9 distinct levels based on actual human performance data.

- Sampling strategies - Custom sampling strategies are proposed to create test sets with balanced keypoint distributions and allow rapid iteration. 

- Evaluation framework - A framework is introduced that allows periodic refreshing of the test set to prevent data leaks and enhance fairness.

- Human Value - A new performance metric is proposed that assigns value to model failures that resemble common human errors, not just strictly correct answers.

So in summary, some of the key terms cover the proposed benchmark itself (ANGO), its categorization and scoring approaches (keypoints, difficulty levels), its sampling and evaluation procedures (sampling strategies, evaluation framework), and new performance metrics like Human Value.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using keypoints instead of subjects to categorize questions. What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach compared to using subjects? 

2. The paper quantifies question difficulty based on human performance data. What other metrics could complement or improve this quantification of difficulty?

3. The 4-step few-shot history sampling strategy aims to minimize information loss. In what cases might this strategy still result in significant information loss? 

4. The keypoint vector representation seems very high-dimensional. Could this lead to issues like overfitting or difficulty visualizing performance? How might the dimensionality be reduced while preserving distinguishability?

5. The sampling strategy for the testset tries to balance keypoint distribution. But are some keypoints inherently much more frequent or central? Could this still lead to imbalances?

6. Periodic refreshing of the testset is proposed to prevent data leaks. What percentage of the testset should be refreshed and how frequently to balance security and continuity?

7. The human value metric aims to assess human-like thinking. But human thinking also involves creativity and lateral connections. How could the metric better capture these dimensions?  

8. The paper analyzes model weaknesses like attention dispersion and lack of language/knowledge specificity. What are some ways these weaknesses could be targeted through changes to model architecture or training?

9. The test questions seem largely closed-domain. What modifications would allow assessing performance on more open-ended domains or tasks?

10. The evaluation framework doesn't discuss interactivity. What interactive evaluation protocols could reveal further dimensions of model capabilities?
