# [Toward enriched Cognitive Learning with XAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI systems are being used more extensively to make high-impact decisions, hence there is a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) to elucidate the rationale behind these systems. 
- However, there is limited research on how XAI can facilitate human learning, especially collaborative learning between humans and AI ("co-learning").

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces CL-XAI, a system for Cognitive Learning supported by XAI techniques. 
- It focuses on two key objectives:
  1) Exploring how human learners comprehend the internal mechanisms of AI models using XAI tools
  2) Evaluating the effectiveness of XAI tools in facilitating learning through human feedback

- CL-XAI incorporates an XAI method called User Feedback-based Counterfactual Explanations (UFCE) to provide explanations to learners to help solve combinatorial problems.

- It uses a virtual game-inspired "Alien Zoo" scenario as a use case where learners nurture an alien (Shub) by feeding it plant combinations. The combinations impact Shub's health and fitness.

- Learners receive counterfactual explanations at intervals about better plant combinations that could have enhanced Shub's health. This aims to build their understanding of the relationships between plant combinations and Shub's health in the underlying AI model.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes using XAI to facilitate cognitive learning and co-learning between humans and AI
- Develops CL-XAI system incorporating UFCE method to provide counterfactual explanations
- Designs game-inspired Alien Zoo scenario as testbed for evaluating CL-XAI
- Outlines subjective measures focused on explanation quality, user satisfaction, user understanding and task learning to evaluate effectiveness of CL-XAI in enabling cognitive learning

The paper highlights the potential of CL-XAI for advancing cognitive learning and lays groundwork for research at intersection of XAI and education/training.
