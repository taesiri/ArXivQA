# [Adaptive Tracking and Perching for Quadrotor in Dynamic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11866)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Tracking and perching maneuver of quadrotors on moving platforms is challenging but can enhance efficiency for various air-ground cooperative tasks. To achieve robust tracking and perching, the quadrotor needs to maintain steady relative motion and reliable perception with the dynamic target. However, several dilemmas exist:
1) Target may get out of sensor field-of-view or be occluded by obstacles, causing loss. 
2) Strict terminal constraints for perching may conflict with safety and dynamics.
3) Sudden changes in complicated environments require responsive replanning.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an adaptive aerial system for quadrotors to track and perch on moving platforms. The main ideas are:

1) Design differentiable visibility metrics considering sensor field-of-view, occlusion, relative distance/angle for tracking. Elastic adjustment of distance/position enhances target observation.  

2) Flexibly synchronize quadrotor's full state (position, velocity, attitude) with time-varying perching surface by predicting target states. A relaxation approach with optimized tangential speed addresses conflicts in terminal constraints.

3) Formulate efficient trajectory optimization with full dynamics and constraints on visibility, safety, dynamics for tracking and perching respectively. Concise problem enables responsive replanning.

Main Contributions:
1) Planning metrics enabling visibility-aware tracking against occlusion and target loss.

2) Method to flexibly adapt terminal perching states while ensuring safety and dynamics. 

3) Efficient trajectory optimization framework involving various constraints for tracking and perching.

4) Extensive simulations and real-world tests that validate the system on a commercial drone with a full-size vehicle, successfully tracking at 8.3m/s and 60Â° inclined perching at 3.5m/s.

The proposed adaptive aerial system with the tracking and perching scheme advances the state-of-the-art and demonstrates great potential for real applications requiring aerial-ground coordination.
