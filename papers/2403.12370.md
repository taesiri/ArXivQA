# [XPose: eXplainable Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "XPose: eXplainable Human Pose Estimation":

Problem:
- Current pose estimation methods focus on improving model architectures, overlooking model interpretability and the relationships between keypoints. 
- Existing XAI methods mainly handle single target tasks like classification, and are difficult to apply to multi-target tasks like pose estimation.
- Computing Shapley values for all keypoints in pose estimation is computationally prohibitive due to the large number of keypoints.

Proposed Solution:
- XPose framework to incorporate XAI principles into pose estimation to reveal each keypoint's contribution to the final predictions.
- Proposes Group Shapley Value (GSV) to efficiently compute Shapley values. First clusters keypoints into groups based on physiological connectivity and perturbation influence. Then computes fine-grained Shapley values within groups and coarse Shapley values between groups.  
- Based on keypoint relationships revealed by XPose, proposes Group-based Keypoint Removal (GKR) data augmentation. Randomly removes individual keypoints while preserving their related keypoints to improve invisible keypoint inference.

Main Contributions:
- First work to introduce XAI to multi-person pose estimation to reveal decision making process and keypoint relationships.
- GSV allows efficient approximation of Shapley values for pose estimation by utilizing keypoint groups.
- GKR leverages insights from GSV to improve model's invisible keypoint inference through selective keypoint removal during training.
- Analysis of keypoint relationships and GKR augmentation validate usefulness of XAI to improve pose estimation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes XPose, a framework that integrates explainable AI principles into human pose estimation to reveal the contributions of individual keypoints to final pose predictions, and also introduces a group-based keypoint removal data augmentation method to enhance models' ability to infer occluded keypoints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes XPose, a novel framework that incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) principles into pose estimation to elucidate the individual contribution of each keypoint to the final predictions, thereby enhancing model transparency and interpretability.

2. It introduces an innovative concept called Group Shapley Value (GSV) to strategically organize keypoints into clusters based on their interdependencies and compute Shapley values in a coarse-to-fine manner, optimizing computational efficiency. 

3. Based on the insights from XPose into keypoint interactions, it devises a novel data augmentation technique known as Group-based Keypoint Removal (GKR) which removes individual keypoints during training while preserving those with strong connections. This refines the model's ability to infer non-visible keypoints.

4. It provides comprehensive empirical validation of GKR across several standard pose estimation methods, demonstrating the efficacy of using XAI insights (from XPose) to directly enhance pose estimation models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an explainable pose estimation framework called XPose and a data augmentation method called GKR that leverages insights from XPose to improve pose estimation performance.
