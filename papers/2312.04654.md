# [NeuSD: Surface Completion with Multi-View Text-to-Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04654)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a 3D surface from images capturing only one side of an object. Existing methods struggle to plausibly complete the unobserved side.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel method that combines classical multi-view reconstruction with generative guidance from a text-conditioned diffusion model. It leverages normal map supervision to effectively combine these objectives.  

The method takes as input images observing one side of an object along with viewpoints from the unobserved side. It iteratively reconstructs the visible side using a volumetric rendering loss while simultaneously guiding the reconstruction of the unseen side using semantically-driven supervision (SDS) from a diffusion model. SDS provides generative cues in the form of text prompts about the identity of the object.  

To enable effective fusion of reconstruction and generative objectives, the method supervises the unobserved viewpoints using normal maps instead of color images. This representation better preserves geometric detail compared to RGB images. The normal maps are rendered from the current iterative estimate of the shape and passed to the diffusion model to compute the SDS loss.

Additionally, the method freezes the noise map input to the diffusion model to stabilize the learning signal. It also explores guidance from multiple viewpoints using a multi-view variant of SDS.

Main Contributions:
- A novel framework to combine classical multi-view reconstruction with generative guidance for shape completion of unobserved surfaces
- The use of normal map supervision with SDS to enable effective fusion of reconstruction and generation
- Extensions like frozen SDS noise and multi-view SDS to further improve results

The method is evaluated on a dataset of 17 objects against reconstruction baselines like NeuS and generation baselines like DreamFusion. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate significant improvements in plausibly completing the unobserved side.
