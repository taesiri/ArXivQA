# [NeuSD: Surface Completion with Multi-View Text-to-Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04654)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a 3D surface from images capturing only one side of an object. Existing methods struggle to plausibly complete the unobserved side.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel method that combines classical multi-view reconstruction with generative guidance from a text-conditioned diffusion model. It leverages normal map supervision to effectively combine these objectives.  

The method takes as input images observing one side of an object along with viewpoints from the unobserved side. It iteratively reconstructs the visible side using a volumetric rendering loss while simultaneously guiding the reconstruction of the unseen side using semantically-driven supervision (SDS) from a diffusion model. SDS provides generative cues in the form of text prompts about the identity of the object.  

To enable effective fusion of reconstruction and generative objectives, the method supervises the unobserved viewpoints using normal maps instead of color images. This representation better preserves geometric detail compared to RGB images. The normal maps are rendered from the current iterative estimate of the shape and passed to the diffusion model to compute the SDS loss.

Additionally, the method freezes the noise map input to the diffusion model to stabilize the learning signal. It also explores guidance from multiple viewpoints using a multi-view variant of SDS.

Main Contributions:
- A novel framework to combine classical multi-view reconstruction with generative guidance for shape completion of unobserved surfaces
- The use of normal map supervision with SDS to enable effective fusion of reconstruction and generation
- Extensions like frozen SDS noise and multi-view SDS to further improve results

The method is evaluated on a dataset of 17 objects against reconstruction baselines like NeuS and generation baselines like DreamFusion. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate significant improvements in plausibly completing the unobserved side.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method that combines neural implicit surface reconstruction with generative guidance from a text-conditioned diffusion model to complete the unseen parts of an object's surface given observations captured only from one side.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution seems to be a novel method for reconstructing 3D surfaces from multi-view images where only one side of the object is observed. The key ideas are:

1) Using a generative diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) to guide the reconstruction of the unobserved side. This allows generating a more plausible surface completion compared to purely reconstruction-based methods.

2) Introducing normal maps as input to the diffusion model, in addition to color images. This supervision with normal maps works better than color images alone to mix reconstruction and generation losses. 

3) Proposed techniques like "frozen SDS" and "multi-view SDS" to make the generated surface more consistent with the observed part.

In the experiments, they demonstrate that their method outperforms previous reconstruction-based (NeuS) and single-view generation-based (RealFusion, One-2-3-45, DreamGaussian) methods in terms of CLIP similarity and user studies. The ablation study verifies the contribution of the different components.

So in summary, the main contribution is a multi-view surface reconstruction method that successfully combines reconstruction and generation to plausibly complete unobserved surfaces.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Multi-view 3D reconstruction
- Shape completion 
- Generative guidance
- Text-to-image diffusion models
- Stable Diffusion
- Surface normal maps
- NeuS
- BlendedMVS dataset

The paper presents a method for multi-view 3D reconstruction and shape completion of objects using generative guidance from text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. It builds on the NeuS reconstruction method and uses rendered surface normal maps along with Stable Diffusion to plausibly complete the unobserved parts of objects. Experiments are conducted on the BlendedMVS dataset.

The key ideas involve using normal maps for supervision, a "frozen" version of Stable Diffusion guidance, and multi-view guidance from the diffusion model. Comparisons are made to reconstruction baselines like NeuS and other generative shape completion methods that use a single input view. Both quantitative metrics and user studies are used to evaluate the results.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel way to integrate generative guidance from a diffusion model into a neural scene representation method for shape completion. What are the key technical innovations that enable this integration? How is the guidance from the diffusion model incorporated into the loss function?

2. The use of normal maps as input to the diffusion model seems to be a critical component of the approach. Why do you think normal maps work better than color images for providing generative guidance in this application? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using normal maps?

3. The paper introduces the concept of "frozen" semantic guidance maps. What is the motivation behind this? How does it lead to better results compared to regular guidance maps? What are the tradeoffs?

4. Multi-view semantic guidance is also proposed. Why is it beneficial to leverage multiple viewpoints rather than just a single one? When would you expect multi-view guidance to help the most and when would it not make much difference?

5. The method relies on a prompt for the diffusion model that describes the unseen part of the shape. How sensitive is the approach to the specific prompt used? What strategies could be used to make the method more robust to prompt choice and tuning? 

6. The results show some failures on certain scenes like the bear, man, and shiba. What are the key reasons conjectured for these failures? How could the approach be made more robust in these problematic cases?

7. The paper compares against several recent single-view generative shape completion techniques. What are the key differences in the problem formulation and why do you think the single-view techniques struggle more in this setting?

8. What other shape completion or novel view synthesis techniques would be interesting to compare against? What advantages or disadvantages might they have compared to the proposed approach?

9. The runtime is currently quite high at 28 hours due to inference of the diffusion model. What are some ways the efficiency could be improved while maintaining quality?

10. The method currently relies on some manual input like viewpoints and masks. How much effort would be needed to make the system fully automatic? What are the major challenges there?
