# [DTMM: Deploying TinyML Models on Extremely Weak IoT Devices with Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09068)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to their limited compute capability, memory and storage. While model compression techniques like pruning can reduce model size, existing structured and unstructured pruning methods have limitations when deployed on MCUs. Structured pruning compromises accuracy at high compression ratios. Unstructured pruning incurs significant indexing overhead for storing sparse weights and requires expensive model conversion before inference.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes DTMM, a specialized library for efficient deployment of pruned TinyML models on MCUs. DTMM introduces "filterlets" as the pruning unit, which groups weights into slices across channels to balance pruning granularity and storage overhead. The discrete weights after filterlet pruning are stored in a compact Filterlet Weight Compressed Storage (FWCS) format. DTMM also designs a convolution operator leveraging SIMD and instruction parallelism to accelerate inference on discrete weights. A pruning strategy scheduler formulates optimization of layer-wise pruning ratios to minimize latency under accuracy and memory constraints.  

Main Contributions:
- Propose filterlet as the pruning unit and FWCS format for high compression and low overhead
- Design a DTMM convolution operator, compatible with ML frameworks, to efficiently execute models after filterlet pruning 
- Develop a pruning strategy scheduler to obtain optimal layer-wise pruning ratios targeting minimum inference latency
- Extensive evaluations show DTMM achieves higher compression and lower latency than state-of-the-art structured and unstructured pruning methods without compromising accuracy

In summary, DTMM enables efficient deployment of highly compressed yet accurate TinyML models on resource-constrained MCUs through innovations in model pruning, storage, and inference acceleration.
