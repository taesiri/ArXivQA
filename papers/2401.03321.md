# [PIXAR: Auto-Regressive Language Modeling in Pixel Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03321)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional NLP systems rely on tokenizers and vocabularies which have limitations like large embedding matrices, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues, and loss of graphical information. 
- Existing pixel-based models like PixelBERT are limited to auto-encoding tasks and cannot generate new text as images.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce PixelAR, the first pixel-based autoregressive language model that does not rely on a predefined vocabulary for input or output text.
- Uses a Transformer decoder architecture that takes in sequences of text image patches as input and outputs new text as image patches.
- Two-stage pretraining strategy:
   - Stage 1: trained with teacher forcing for reconstruction
   - Stage 2: short adversarial pretraining to improve readability of generated text

Main Contributions:  
- PixelAR matches performance of PixelBERT on GLUE benchmark discriminative tasks while using fewer parameters and simpler architecture
- Shows possibility of open-vocabulary generative language models operating fully in pixel space
- Proposes adversarial pretraining method that significantly improves readability for text generation as images
- Achieves performance comparable to GPT-2 on short text generation tasks like LAMBADA while avoiding need for symbolic text input representation

In summary, the paper introduces PixelAR as the first open-vocabulary autoregressive language model operating on pixel inputs/outputs. It matches existing models on discriminative tasks and shows potential for generative pixel-based models through adversarial pretraining, paving the way for models that generalize across languages/cultures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Pixar, the first pixel-based autoregressive language model that can perform both discriminative and generative language tasks without relying on a predefined vocabulary.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces Pixar, the first pixel-based autoregressive language model that can generate new text as images without relying on a predefined vocabulary. This allows it to support open-vocabulary generative language tasks.

2) It proposes a two-stage pretraining strategy for Pixar. Stage 1 trains it autoregressively to reconstruct text images. Stage 2 adds an adversarial loss to improve generation quality and readability. 

3) It demonstrates that with the two-stage pretraining, Pixar can achieve performance on par with previous encoder-decoder pixel-based models on discriminative tasks, while also supporting generative tasks comparable to GPT-2 on short text generation.

4) The results showcase the potential of using pixel representations for building large language models that generalize well across languages and domains, avoiding issues like out-of-vocabulary tokens.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting the first open-vocabulary pixel-based language model that can understand and generate text without relying on a predefined vocabulary of tokens.
