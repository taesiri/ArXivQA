# [Primal-Dual iLQR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of solving unconstrained discrete-time optimal control problems. These problems involve optimizing a cost function over a sequence of states and controls, subject to discrete-time dynamics constraints. Naively applying generic optimization methods results in high computational complexity. Existing specialized methods like DDP, iLQR and Stagewise Newton are single shooting and lack global convergence guarantees. Recently proposed multiple shooting methods like GNMS and FDDP also lack convergence analysis.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a primal-dual interior point sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach. This specializes the general SQP framework to leverage the structure of discrete-time optimal control problems. Specifically:

- It follows a direct multiple shooting formulation, allowing efficient warm-starting of trajectories. 

- It uses an l2 augmented Lagrangian merit function and constructs convex quadratic subproblems.

- It efficiently solves the quadratic subproblems via the LQR algorithm by eliminating state variables. 

- It features a line search procedure ensuring global convergence.

- It uses a dual LQR backward pass to compute Lagrange multipliers.

- It inherits fast local convergence from the SQP approach without needing second order corrections.

Main Contributions:

- Specializes the NPSQP algorithm to discrete-time optimal control problems, ensuring global convergence and local superlinear convergence rates.

- Avoids control input dimension expansion for multiple shooting unlike ALTRO, and second order corrections unlike FATROP/acados. 

- Simpler derivation and implementation than convergent multiple shooting methods like GNMS and FDDP.

- Can significantly improve performance of ALTRO by removing control expansion.

- Provides globalization strategy to improve methods like FATROP and acados that currently lack convergence guarantees.

In summary, the paper introduces a globally convergent primal-dual SQP algorithm for discrete-time optimal control that features fast local convergence rates. The simplicity of derivation and leverage of structural properties makes it an accessible and efficient approach.
