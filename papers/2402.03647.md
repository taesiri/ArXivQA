# [CAMBranch: Contrastive Learning with Augmented MILPs for Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03647)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "CAMBranch: Contrastive Learning with Augmented MILPs for Branching":

Problem:
- Solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems using Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithms is computationally challenging. A key decision in B&B is branching (selecting which variable to branch on), where traditional methods rely on handcrafted heuristics.
- Recent work has shown promise in using machine learning, specifically imitation learning, to learn branching policies by imitating the Strong Branching strategy. However, collecting expert samples for imitation learning of Strong Branching is extremely time consuming.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a framework called CAMBranch that uses data augmentation and contrastive learning to enhance imitation learning with limited expert data.
- CAMBranch generates Augmented MILPs (AMILPs) from limited seed MILPs by randomly shifting integer variables. AMILPs share identical branching decisions as their seed MILPs.
- MILPs and AMILPs are encoded into bipartite graphs and fed into Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. Contrastive learning is used to bring MILP/AMILP embeddings closer while pushing other AMILPs apart.
- The model is trained using both MILPs and AMILPs to imitate Strong Branching. This allows learning from more data even when expert samples are limited.

Main Contributions:
- A data augmentation method via variable shifting to generate AMILPs from seed MILPs, with proofs showing AMILPs share branching decisions.
- A contrastive learning approach to enhance learning on MILP and AMILP graphs.
- Evaluations on 4 MILP problems show CAMBranch outperforms state-of-the-art methods when using just 10% training data.
- Significantly more efficient for collecting expert samples compared to solving many MILPs with Strong Branching.
- Ablation studies validate benefits of data augmentation and contrastive learning.

In summary, CAMBranch enables effective imitation learning of branching policies using limited expert data, through data augmentation and contrastive learning on MILP bipartite graphs. It shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods when expert data is scarce.
