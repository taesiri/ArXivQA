# [Learning with Imbalanced Noisy Data by Preventing Bias in Sample   Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning with noisy labels is challenging as inevitable imperfect labels in real-world datasets can substantially hurt model performance. Recent methods typically regard low-loss samples as clean ones and discard high-loss samples. However, real-world datasets contain not only noisy labels but also class imbalance, where minority classes have far fewer training samples. This imbalance issue causes failure for loss-based sample selection, as under-learning of minority classes also produces high losses. Existing methods fail when simultaneously handling noisy labels and class imbalance.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a simple yet effective method to address noisy labels in imbalanced datasets, with the following key components:

1) Class-Balance-based Sample Selection (CBS): Divides training set into clean and noisy subsets per class rather than globally. Ensures minority classes are sufficiently selected, preventing them from being wrongly discarded as noisy samples.  

2) Confidence-based Sample Augmentation (CSA): Further enhances reliability of selected clean samples by fusing sample pairs based on prediction confidence.

3) Label Correction: Corrects labels of noisy samples using exponential moving average of predictions over training epochs. Introduces Average Confidence Margin (ACM) to measure quality of corrected labels and filter unreliable ones.

4) Consistency Regularization: Imposes consistency between different augmented views and training epochs on filtered label-corrected noisy samples to further improve model robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes class-balanced sample selection to prevent biased selection against minority classes when simultaneously handling label noise and class imbalance.

- Introduces confidence-based sample augmentation and average confidence margin for reliably exploiting selected clean and corrected noisy samples.

- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world noisy and imbalanced datasets.

The key novelty lies in explicitly tackling the класс imbalance to prevent it from interfering with handling noisy labels, through balanced sample selection and reliability enhancement techniques. Both label noise and imbalance issues are effectively addressed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a method for learning with noisy and imbalanced data that employs balanced sample selection, confidence-based sample augmentation, label correction via exponential moving average, average confidence margin filtering, and consistency regularization to effectively address the challenges of label noise and class imbalance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a class-balance-based sample selection (CBS) strategy to divide the noisy training samples into clean and noisy subsets while ensuring samples from tail classes are sufficiently selected. This helps alleviate the learning bias issue caused by class imbalance. 

2. It introduces a confidence-based sample augmentation (CSA) method to enhance the reliability of the selected clean samples.

3. It employs the exponential moving average (EMA) to correct labels for the selected noisy samples, and uses the proposed average confidence margin (ACM) metric to assess the quality of the corrected labels. This ensures low-quality corrected labels are discarded.

4. It adopts consistency regularization on the filtered high-confidence corrected noisy samples to further improve model robustness and stability.

5. It provides comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy and imbalanced datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in alleviating the negative impact of class imbalance on handling label noise.

In summary, the main contribution is a new method that can effectively learn from noisy and imbalanced training data by employing class-balanced sample selection and confidence-based sample augmentation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Noisy labels - The paper focuses on learning with noisy (incorrect) labels in the training data.

- Class imbalance - In addition to label noise, the paper also addresses the issue of class imbalance, where some classes have many more training examples than others. 

- Sample selection - A core part of the method is sample selection, where the training data is divided into clean and noisy subsets.

- Class-balanced selection - The proposed class-balance-based sample selection prevents neglecting tail/minority classes.

- Confidence-based augmentation - The paper proposes confidence-based sample augmentation to enhance reliability of selected clean samples.

- Label correction - Noisy labels are corrected using exponential moving average of model predictions.

- Average confidence margin - Proposed metric to measure quality of corrected noisy labels during training.

- Consistency regularization - Used to improve feature learning and stabilize training by encouraging prediction consistency.

In summary, the key focus areas are learning with noisy and imbalanced data through balanced sample selection and label correction techniques.
