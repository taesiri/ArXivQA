# Building a Personalized Dialogue System with Prompt-Tuning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:Can a personalized dialogue system be built that generates more natural and consistent responses based on a given persona, by using prompt-tuning of a pre-trained large-scale language model?The key points are:- Existing dialogue systems trained on diverse corpora often generate inconsistent responses due to the variety of speakers/personas in the data. - The authors propose using prompt-tuning, where they freeze a pre-trained language model and only optimize the embedding vectors of an added prompt that contains persona information.- They hypothesize this allows building a dialogue system capable of natural, consistent responses based on a persona, while reducing computational costs compared to full fine-tuning.- They test this via experiments on English and Japanese dialogue datasets, evaluating both automatic metrics and manual ratings of fluency, engagingness, relevance and persona consistency.So in summary, the central research question/hypothesis is whether prompt-tuning of large pre-trained models can enable building personalized dialogue systems that generate more natural and persona-consistent responses compared to alternatives. The paper aims to demonstrate this experimentally.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a method to build a personalized dialogue system by prompt-tuning a pre-trained language model using a dialogue dataset with utterances based on a single persona. - Showing through experiments in English and Japanese that this approach can produce more natural and consistent responses compared to fine-tuning, while using less computational resources.- Demonstrating that the method can work even with small training datasets of a few hundred to thousand utterance-response pairs.In summary, the key contribution seems to be presenting a way to efficiently adapt a pre-trained language model into a personalized dialogue system that generates consistent and natural responses aligned with a specific persona, without needing to fine-tune the entire model. The experiments validate the efficacy of this prompt-tuning approach.
