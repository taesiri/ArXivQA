# [Deep Dynamics: Vehicle Dynamics Modeling with a Physics-Informed Neural   Network for Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04374)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Deep Dynamics, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for modeling vehicle dynamics of autonomous racecars. It addresses limitations of prior works like the Deep Pacejka Model which cannot ensure estimated coefficients remain physically meaningful. The proposed PINN combines neural networks with physics-based modeling to capture complex racecar dynamics like tire forces and drivetrain effects. It introduces a novel Physics Guard layer to constrain estimated coefficients within predefined physical ranges. Experiments using simulated and real-world racecar data demonstrate that Deep Dynamics significantly outperforms baselines in predicting future states. Closed-loop tests also show faster lap times and higher speeds using Deep Dynamics with model predictive control compared to alternatives. The method displays promise for enabling precise control and motion planning for autonomous racecars. Key advantages are accurate state forecasts, scalability to varying track/tire conditions, and real-time computational speed. Future work includes testing on high-fidelity simulators and implementation on full-scale vehicles to validate real-world feasibility. Overall, Deep Dynamics offers an interpretable data-driven approach to effectively model nonlinear racecar dynamics while adhering to physical constraints.
