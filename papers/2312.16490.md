# [Understanding News Creation Intents: Frame, Dataset, and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16490)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The contemporary news landscape has undergone profound transformations, making news more vulnerable to manipulation and disinformation, straying from serving the public interest. 
- News creation intent, referring to the purpose or intention behind creating a news article, is an essential characteristic but there lacks a systematic framework to understand it.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes NINT, the first deconstruction framework to formally analyze news creation intent from the recipient's perspective. 
- NINT decomposes intent into beliefs, desires and plans based on philosophy and cognitive science theories. 
- A new benchmark dataset NewsInt with 12,959 news articles is introduced along with the benchmark method MINT for intent identification.

Key Contributions:
- Theoretical frame: NINT is the first work to propose a theoretical frame to facilitate systematic analysis of perceived news creation intent.
- New dataset and benchmark: NewsInt is constructed as the first dataset with fine-grained intent labels to enable further research. MINT serves as an efficient benchmark method.  
- Demonstrated effectiveness: Experiments show NINT brings noticeable gains in intent identification and contributes to enhanced performance in downstream tasks relying on news comprehension.  

In summary, this paper makes a foundational step towards formal modeling of news creation intents by contributing the theoretical frame, dataset and benchmark method, which opens up avenues for healthier news ecosystem and various applications.
