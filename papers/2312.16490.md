# [Understanding News Creation Intents: Frame, Dataset, and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16490)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The contemporary news landscape has undergone profound transformations, making news more vulnerable to manipulation and disinformation, straying from serving the public interest. 
- News creation intent, referring to the purpose or intention behind creating a news article, is an essential characteristic but there lacks a systematic framework to understand it.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes NINT, the first deconstruction framework to formally analyze news creation intent from the recipient's perspective. 
- NINT decomposes intent into beliefs, desires and plans based on philosophy and cognitive science theories. 
- A new benchmark dataset NewsInt with 12,959 news articles is introduced along with the benchmark method MINT for intent identification.

Key Contributions:
- Theoretical frame: NINT is the first work to propose a theoretical frame to facilitate systematic analysis of perceived news creation intent.
- New dataset and benchmark: NewsInt is constructed as the first dataset with fine-grained intent labels to enable further research. MINT serves as an efficient benchmark method.  
- Demonstrated effectiveness: Experiments show NINT brings noticeable gains in intent identification and contributes to enhanced performance in downstream tasks relying on news comprehension.  

In summary, this paper makes a foundational step towards formal modeling of news creation intents by contributing the theoretical frame, dataset and benchmark method, which opens up avenues for healthier news ecosystem and various applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a theoretical framework for modeling news creation intent, introduces a corresponding dataset and benchmark method, and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in enhancing intent understanding and performance on downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Theoretical frame: The paper proposes a deconstruction frame called NINT (News INTent) to facilitate the analysis and understanding of perceived news creation intent. The frame draws from interdisciplinary theory and models intent as comprised of beliefs, desires, and plans.

2. New dataset and benchmark: Based on the NINT frame, the paper introduces NewsInt, the first dataset for news creation intent understanding. The dataset has 12,959 news articles with fine-grained intent labels. It serves as a benchmark for investigating latent intent within news reporting.  

3. Effectiveness in application: Through experiments, the paper demonstrates that the proposed NINT frame benefits both small and large language models in understanding news creation intent. It also shows the frame's effectiveness in facilitating news comprehension and cultivating a healthier news ecosystem, as evidenced by improved performance on downstream tasks like fake news detection and news popularity prediction.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of a systematic framework (NINT), dataset (NewsInt), and benchmark method (Mint) to facilitate research into news creation intent and its downstream applications. The deconstruction approach and interdisciplinary foundations aim to establish a robust basis for future explorations of this crucial but understudied research direction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- News creation intent - The purpose or intention behind the creation of a news article. This is a central concept that the paper aims to analyze and understand systematically. 

- Deconstruction frame (NINT) - The proposed framework to facilitate analysis of news creation intent by breaking it down into constituent components like beliefs, desires, and plans.

- NewsInt dataset - The benchmark dataset constructed in the paper for news intent identification, comprising over 12,000 news articles. 

- Multi-expert News INTent identification model (MINT) - The proposed benchmark method for identifying news creation intent using multiple specialized expert models.

- Beliefs, desires, plans - The key components of intent that are formally defined and analyzed as part of the NINT frame. These represent the overarching writing direction, objectives, and strategies in news creation.

- Intent polarity - Assessment of whether the identified intent is harmful or not based on certain threat criteria.

- Downstream tasks - Fake news detection and news popularity prediction that are shown to benefit from a deeper understanding of news creation intents.

In summary, the key terms revolve around systematically analyzing news creation intent using a proposed deconstruction frame, dataset, and model, and demonstrating its utility on relevant downstream tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a deconstruction framework called NINT for understanding news creation intent. What are the key components of this framework and how does it help model intent?

2. The paper defines the task of news intent identification and breaks it down into subtasks involving identifying belief, desire, plan, and overall intent polarity. What is the motivation behind framing intent identification this way? 

3. The paper draws inspiration from philosophy and cognitive science literature on intent and intentional action. What theories does it reference and apply to the news domain? How does this enhance the conception of news intent?

4. What annotation methodology does the paper employ to label the news dataset with fine-grained intent labels? What steps were taken to ensure data quality and reliability?

5. The proposed model Mint has specialized expert modules for modeling belief, desire and plan respectively. How does the expert aggregator combine their outputs? What is the intuition behind this design?

6. What downstream tasks were selected to evaluate the utility of modeling news intent? How exactly was the captured intent information incorporated into the downstream models? 

7. The paper demonstrates that the proposed NINT framework benefits both large language models and specialized models on intent identification and downstream tasks. What hypotheses might explain this observation?

8. What are some limitations of the data annotation process? How could the subjectivity in interpreting intent be accounted for?  

9. The paper mostly focuses on perceived intent from the content. What additional information could complement or validate the analysis of news creation intent?

10. The proposed deconstruction framework for intent is assessed specifically for news. What are your thoughts on its generalizability to understand intent manifested in other domains?
