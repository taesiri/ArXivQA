# [A Survey of Constraint Formulations in Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) is critical for applying RL to real-world problems. A popular approach is to maximize the expected cumulative reward under safety constraints.
- However, there is a diversity of constraint representations in safe RL research and little discussion of their interrelations, making it difficult to systematically understand the field.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a comprehensive survey on constraint formulations for safe RL and representative algorithms for each formulation.
- Seven common formulations are presented: expected cumulative safety constraint, state constraint, joint chance constraint, expected instantaneous safety constraint with time-variant threshold, almost surely cumulative safety constraint, almost surely instantaneous safety constraint with time-invariant threshold, and almost surely instantaneous safety constraint with time-variant threshold.

- The paper introduces notions of "transformability", "generalizability", and "conservative approximation" to elucidate theoretical relations among formulations. 

- It shows that the expected instantaneous safety constraint with time-variant threshold and the almost surely instantaneous safety constraint with time-variant threshold can be regarded as identical or more general safe RL (IoMG-SafeRL) problems that other formulations can be transformed into.

Main Contributions:
- First survey focusing on constraint formulations rather than algorithms for safe RL.

- Comprehensive overview of seven common formulations in safe RL and representative algorithms.

- Clarification of mathematical relations among formulations through introduced notions. 

- Identification of two IoMG-SafeRL problems that serve as common grounds.

- Discussion of status of safe RL research and future directions regarding formulation and algorithm selection, online vs offline RL, and when safety guarantees are needed.

The paper helps to bridge safe RL problems to appropriate algorithms through better understanding of formulations and their connections. It encourages more fundamental and applied research by providing a systematic perspective on safe RL.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey of diverse safety constraint representations in safe reinforcement learning and elucidates their theoretical interrelations, current research landscape, and future directions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of safe reinforcement learning research from the perspective of constraint formulations. Specifically:

1) It presents seven common constraint formulations for safe RL and reviews representative algorithms designed for each formulation (Section 3 and Table 1). 

2) It elucidates the theoretical relations (transformability, generalizability, conservative approximation) among the constraint formulations to reveal their mutual connections (Section 4). Notably, it identifies two problems called identical or more general safe RL (IoMG-SafeRL) problems that other common problems can be transformed into.

3) It discusses the current state of safe RL research, including considerations around formulation and algorithm selection, online vs offline RL, and future research directions (Section 5).

In summary, unlike existing survey papers that focus on algorithms, this paper organizes safe RL research by constraint formulations and lays the groundwork for gaining a systematic understanding of the field. It bridges problems faced by readers to appropriate algorithms and encourages further research by clarifying the relations between different formulations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. This paper discusses transforming one safe RL formulation into another equivalent formulation. What are the benefits and limitations of such transformations? When would it be better to just solve the original formulation rather than transforming it?

2. The paper defines "transformability" between two safe RL formulations. What are some examples of safety constraints that would NOT be transformable between the formulations discussed in this paper? What makes those constraints fundamentally different?  

3. The paper shows Problem 4 (expected instantaneous safety constraint) and Problem 7 (almost surely instantaneous safety constraint) are the most general formulations that other problems can transform into. What modifications or extensions could be made to these formulations to make them even more general?

4. For the conservative approximation result connecting Problem 3 (chance constraint) and Problem 4, what other approximations could be made to connect Problem 3 with the other formulations? How tight would those approximations be?

5. The paper focuses on safety constraints defined over states and actions. How could more complex safety constraints be formulated, such as constraints over full trajectories or constraints defined via languages? How might those impact transformability?

6. The paper mentions offline RL as a promising approach for safe RL. What modifications would need to be made to the formulations and algorithms in this paper to extend them to the offline setting? What new theoretical results might be proven?

7. The paper focuses on single agent safety. What new issues arise when trying to ensure multi-agent safety via these formulations? How would the constraints and algorithms need to be extended?

8. What types of function approximators would and would not be compatible with the formulations and algorithms presented in this paper? What complications might arise?

9. The paper does not do an empirical evaluation of the different formulations and algorithms. What empirical analysis would provide the most additional insight beyond the theory developed in the paper?

10. The safety constraints in this paper depend only on states and actions. What are some ways the formulations could be extended to constraints over model parameters as well, to ensure safety over distributional shift?
