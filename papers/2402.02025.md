# [A Survey of Constraint Formulations in Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) is critical for applying RL to real-world problems. A popular approach is to maximize the expected cumulative reward under safety constraints.
- However, there is a diversity of constraint representations in safe RL research and little discussion of their interrelations, making it difficult to systematically understand the field.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a comprehensive survey on constraint formulations for safe RL and representative algorithms for each formulation.
- Seven common formulations are presented: expected cumulative safety constraint, state constraint, joint chance constraint, expected instantaneous safety constraint with time-variant threshold, almost surely cumulative safety constraint, almost surely instantaneous safety constraint with time-invariant threshold, and almost surely instantaneous safety constraint with time-variant threshold.

- The paper introduces notions of "transformability", "generalizability", and "conservative approximation" to elucidate theoretical relations among formulations. 

- It shows that the expected instantaneous safety constraint with time-variant threshold and the almost surely instantaneous safety constraint with time-variant threshold can be regarded as identical or more general safe RL (IoMG-SafeRL) problems that other formulations can be transformed into.

Main Contributions:
- First survey focusing on constraint formulations rather than algorithms for safe RL.

- Comprehensive overview of seven common formulations in safe RL and representative algorithms.

- Clarification of mathematical relations among formulations through introduced notions. 

- Identification of two IoMG-SafeRL problems that serve as common grounds.

- Discussion of status of safe RL research and future directions regarding formulation and algorithm selection, online vs offline RL, and when safety guarantees are needed.

The paper helps to bridge safe RL problems to appropriate algorithms through better understanding of formulations and their connections. It encourages more fundamental and applied research by providing a systematic perspective on safe RL.
