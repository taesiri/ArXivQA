# [Delivery Optimized Discovery in Behavioral User Segmentation under   Budget Constrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03388)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Firms want to discover behavioral user segments from user data to send targeted messages. However, delivery of messages to users through media channels like Facebook faces two key challenges:
    1. Only a fraction of users in a segment are present/matched on a particular media channel
    2. Of the matched users, only some fraction actually sees the message (exposure rate)
- Existing segmentation algorithms ignore these delivery uncertainties and also do not consider budget constraints of firms

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a joint optimization approach for "Delivery Aware Discovery" (DAD) of behavioral segments that maximizes reach subject to budget constraint
- It uses a two part network architecture:
    1. Encoder-Predictor network for predictive segmentation 
    2. Additional networks to map segments to media channels and compute reach
- Five DAD formulations are presented based on Mean Squared Error and constraint optimization
- New metrics introduced: Spend per Unit Reach, Effective Spend, Reach Efficiency-Effectiveness

Main Contributions:  
- Identifies the new problem of incorporating delivery uncertainties during behavioral segmentation
- Presents optimization frameworks for joint discovery-delivery under budget constraints  
- Introduces mapping between behavioral and static user data spaces to enable stochastic assignment of segments to channels
- Defines new metrics spanning conversion prediction, spend efficiency and reach effectiveness
- Experiments show DAD models achieve at par accuracy as discovery only models along with improved spend and reach performance

The paper makes useful contributions in making behavioral segmentation more aligned with realities of message delivery through external channels under budget constraints. The joint optimization approach and new metrics help advance research in this practical problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a stochastic optimization approach for jointly optimizing the discovery of behavioral user segments and delivery of segment-specific messages under budget constraints by modeling the uncertainty in matching segments to media platforms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new research problem of delivery aware discovery in behavioral user segmentation. This jointly optimizes the goals of accurate user segmentation (discovery) and maximizing reach for communication (delivery) under budget constraints.

2. It proposes a new model architecture consisting of an encoder, predictor, selector, embedding dictionary, and a Beh2Stat mapping function. This performs stochastic optimization to achieve the dual goals of predictive segmentation and optimizing reach.

3. It recognizes the need to map from the firm's behavioral data space to the media's static data space for delivery. The Beh2Stat function learns this mapping.

4. It performs the optimization under budget constraints using techniques like augmented Lagrangian and barrier methods. 

5. It introduces new metrics like "Effective Spend" and "Reach Efficiency-Effectiveness" to evaluate the performance in terms of accuracy, spend, reach and budget efficacy.

6. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over baselines focused only on segmentation, in proprietary and public datasets. The sensitivity analysis and ablation study further validate the necessity of the components in the architecture.

In summary, this paper makes both modeling and metrics contributions for a new problem of joint discovery and delivery optimization in user segmentation under budgets. The experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and delivery efficacy.
