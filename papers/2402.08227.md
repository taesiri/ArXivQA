# [Privacy-Preserving Language Model Inference with Instance Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Language models deployed as cloud services (LMaaS) are convenient for users to access powerful pre-trained models. However, they pose privacy risks as users' input data and model outputs are exposed in plaintext, allowing potential misuse. Prior privacy research has focused on protecting input privacy, but output/decision privacy remains unexplored. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a method called Instance Obfuscated Inference (IoI) to provide decision privacy for text classification tasks in LMaaS. It works by "obfuscating" the input text with additional texts called obfuscators. The obfuscated input and obfuscators are encoded into privacy-preserving representations and sent to the cloud model. The model's outputs on them are intentionally manipulated and not indicative of the true output, providing decision privacy. Only the user who knows the obfuscators can resolve the true output.

Key Contributions:
- First approach to provide decision privacy for LMaaS in a black-box manner, without needing model modification.
- Comprehensively studies the strategies for input obfuscation and privacy-preserving output resolution.  
- Defines metrics to evaluate decision privacy; empirically shows IoI provides strong privacy while maintaining good task performance.

In summary, the key novelty is obfuscating inputs to manipulate model outputs and hide true decisions from adversaries, while still allowing legitimate users to resolve the actual outputs. This provides output/decision privacy for LMaaS without needing model changes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called Instance-Obfuscated Inference that protects the privacy of language model inferences by obfuscating input instances and resolving true decisions, without modifying the language model service.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first approach to explore the feasibility of protecting pre-trained language model (PLM) decisions in a black-box manner. 

2. The paper comprehensively studies the instance obfuscation strategies and privacy-preserving decision resolution in the context of decision privacy. It defines decision privacy and proposes metrics to evaluate it.

3. The paper empirically verifies the performance and privacy strength of the proposed method, called Instance-Obfuscated Inference (IoI), on various benchmarking tasks. It shows that IoI can protect decision privacy while maintaining good task performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a novel method, IoI, to protect the privacy of PLM decisions under black-box settings without losing compatibility with existing input privacy protection methods. This helps address the previously unexplored issue of decision privacy in language model as a service scenarios.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Language Models as a Service (LMaaS)
- Privacy preservation
- Decision privacy 
- Instance obfuscation
- Text classification

- Input privacy
- Privacy-preserving representation
- Obfuscators
- Decision resolution

The paper proposes a method called "Instance-Obfuscated Inference" (IoI) to protect the privacy of language model inferences in a black-box LMaaS setting, with a focus on decision privacy. It utilizes techniques like instance obfuscation using text concatenation and balancing to perturb the inputs, as well as privacy-preserving text representations. It also proposes a decision resolution method to recover the true labels after receiving the obfuscated output from the language model. The approach is evaluated on several text classification benchmark datasets.

Some other notable concepts include obfuscator selection, obfuscator balancing, threat models, and analyses of privacy strengths and utility costs. But the main problem being addressed is decision privacy for language model inferences, using instance obfuscation techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new concept called "decision privacy". How is decision privacy different from existing notions of privacy preservation such as input privacy or training data privacy? What new challenges does protecting decision privacy introduce?

2. Instance obfuscation is a key technique proposed in the paper. What is the intuition behind using instance obfuscation to achieve decision privacy? How does concatenating the input with obfuscators help obscure the true decision? 

3. Balancing obfuscators is mentioned as an important strategy. Why is it important to have a balanced set of obfuscators in terms of their labels? How does balancing help improve the accuracy of decision resolution?

4. What are the requirements for an instance to qualify as a good obfuscator? Why is it sufficient to randomly sample sentences as obfuscators instead of needing any correlation with the actual instances?

5. Privacy-preserving representation generation (PPRG) is proposed to encode the obfuscated instances. What properties must the PPRG method satisfy? Why can't the adversary reverse the encodings even with white-box access to the language model?

6. Explain the decision resolution method outlined in the paper. How does comparing the distributions of the obfuscated instance and the obfuscator help recover the true decision? What is the intuition behind the specific resolution formula proposed?

7. How does lengthening the obfuscator impact the accuracy of the resolved and obfuscated decisions? What does this imply about the way models perceive mixed input sequences?

8. The threat model assumes an adversary with white-box access to the language model. What additional attacks does this capability enable and how does the method defend against them? 

9. Analyze the privacy guarantees provided by the method. In what ways is recovering the true input or decision computationally infeasible for the adversary?

10. What are the costs in terms of computation and communication overheads to achieve decision privacy using this method? How can these costs be adjusted to balance privacy and performance?
