# [AGI Safety Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01109)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

What are the key problems and challenges regarding safety for artificial general intelligence (AGI), and what progress has been made so far on addressing them?

The authors state in the introduction that the intention of the paper is to "provide an easily accessible and up-to-date collection of references for the emerging field of AGI safety." 

The paper appears to have two main goals:

1) Identify and summarize the key problems and challenges for developing safe AGI. This includes things like value specification, reliability, corrigibility, security, safe learning, etc.

2) Survey recent research progress on understanding these problems and developing techniques/approaches for addressing them. This includes sections reviewing proposed solutions for value specification, reliability, corrigibility, security, etc.

So in summary, the central research focus seems to be a literature review summarizing the current problems in AGI safety and surveying the state of research aimed at enabling the safe development of AGI. The authors aim to provide an overview of the field and point researchers to relevant references on the key challenges.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be providing an up-to-date literature review and overview of the emerging field of AGI safety research. Specifically, the paper:

- Covers progress on conceptual models and formalisms for thinking about potential future AGIs, including definitions of intelligence, the orthogonality thesis, convergent instrumental goals, and more. 

- Surveys predictions and debates about when AGI may be created and whether it could lead to an "intelligence explosion" or technological singularity.

- Lists and discusses major AGI safety problems that have been identified, relating them to research agendas put forth by organizations like MIRI, FHI, DeepMind etc.

- Reviews proposed solutions and design ideas for safe AGI, including techniques for value alignment, reliability, corrigibility, security, safe exploration, and more. 

- Discusses current public policy issues around AGI safety and provides references for further reading.

In summary, the paper aims to provide an accessible, up-to-date collection of references spanning the technical, social, and policy aspects of AGI safety research, in order to help new researchers enter the field and provide an overview for traditional AI researchers. The comprehensive literature review seems to be the main contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This literature review surveys research on ensuring the safe and beneficial development of artificial general intelligence, including understanding AGI, predicting AGI outcomes, identifying AGI problems, and designing safe AGI systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of AGI safety:

- It provides a broad literature review of the field, summarizing key ideas, problems, and research agendas. This makes it more comprehensive than papers focused on a specific AGI safety issue. However, it does not go into as much technical depth as those specialized papers.

- The paper emphasizes identifying problems and challenges, as well as reviewing proposed solutions. It does not contain significant original technical research contributions. This contrasts with papers that introduce new formal models, algorithms, or theoretical results for AGI safety.

- The writing style and structure aims for accessibility to a wide AI/ML audience. It avoids heavy mathematical formalism and provides high-level overviews of technical topics. This differs from more theoretical AGI safety papers written for specialized research audiences.

- Compared to previous survey papers like Sotala's 2014 review, this paper covers more recent research published in the rapidly growing field. It also connects the research to various institutions and agendas. 

- The scope focuses specifically on AI/AGI safety, unlike surveys of broader AI ethics or governance issues. However, it also attempts to summarize relevant policy and public debates.

In summary, this literature review provides a relatively up-to-date, high-level synthesis of the AGI safety field for a broad readership. It fills a useful niche between specialized technical papers and very broad ethical/policy overviews. The comprehensive referencing allows readers to dig deeper into any particular topic of interest.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Further work on understanding and formalizing potential future AGIs, including things like subagents, distributed agency, physicalistic reasoning, and logical non-omniscience. The authors argue that the biggest AGI safety problem may be one we have not thought of yet, so further research to anticipate issues is needed.

- More technical work on proposed safety solutions like corrigibility, value alignment, decision theory, security/robustness, intelligibility, and safe exploration. The authors review initial progress in these areas, but note many open problems remain.

- Further study of techniques for specifying and learning human values and preferences. The authors discuss inverse reinforcement learning, learning from critiques, debates, stories etc. as promising directions.

- Public policy research on issues like regulation of AGI development, setting norms and incentives among developers, international coordination and competition. The authors note current policy is limited.

- Additional forecasting work on when AGI may be created and what the consequences could be. The authors review some predictions but note high uncertainty remains.

- General integration of AGI safety ideas into mainstream AI research to avoid risks from narrow AI systems scaled up to AGI levels.

So in summary, the authors point to remaining conceptual gaps in understanding AGI, many open technical problems in AGI safety, the need for more public policy work, forecasting and integration of safety research into the field as a whole. Their survey helps highlight these open areas for future work.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this AGI safety literature review paper:

1. The paper discusses learning reward functions from human preferences or demonstrations. What are some of the key challenges in scalably and reliably learning complex reward functions in this way? How might the techniques proposed, like debate and comparisons, handle tasks with high-dimensional continuous state/action spaces?

2. The paper brings up approval-directed agents as an alternative to goal/reward-directed agents. What are some ways an approval-directed agent could fail, and how might it be made robust? Could approval and goal-directed agents be combined, and if so, how? 

3. For the self-modification problem, the paper discusses utility preservation arguments. What assumptions are required for these arguments to hold? How might these assumptions be validated or enforced in practice? Are there alternative techniques that could ensure an agent's objectives remain stable during self-modification?

4. The paper mentions several decision theory proposals like causal, evidential, and functional decision theory. What are the key distinctions between these theories and what types of environments might favor one over the others? How might an AGI determine the right decision theory to use?

5. For corrigibility, the paper discusses indifference, ignorance, and uncertainty approaches. What are the tradeoffs between these methods and are there ways they could be combined? How can we ensure an AGI interprets human input as intended in the cooperative inverse RL framework?

6. The paper brings up adversarial examples and verification of neural networks. How might verification techniques scale to large state-of-the-art models? Are adversarial examples a concern for rational agents, or just an issue of overfitting in current ML techniques?  

7. For interpretability, the paper mentions some techniques like Psychlab and activations visualization. What are the limitations of these methods, especially as architectures become more complex? How could interpretability methods give insight into an AGI's objective function?

8. For safe exploration, the paper describes training a detector to recognize catastrophic actions. What are some challenges in defining catastrophes, especially in complex environments? How could a catastrophe detector generalize to new types of failures it hasn't seen before?

9. The paper discusses a few moral theories like social intuitionism, game theory, and multi-objective optimization. What are the challenges in defining a moral theory broad and flexible enough for AGI? How could an AGI learn and adapt its moral principles over time?

10. The public policy section mentions incentives and guidelines for safe AGI development. What role should the government play versus industry and academia? What policy levers could balance AGI progress and safety, without stifling innovation?

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this AGI safety literature review paper:

1. The paper discusses learning reward functions from human preferences or actions as an approach to value alignment. This relies on the assumption that human preferences are consistent and rational. However, human preferences often exhibit inconsistencies, context-dependence, and irrational biases. How can reward learning methods be made robust to noisy, inconsistent, or biased human input?

2. The paper proposes approval-directed agents as an alternative to goal-directed agents. However, approval is also a type of reward signal that could potentially be gamed. How can approval-directed architectures be made robust to approval hacking or corruption? 

3. The paper discusses utility indifference and ignorance as techniques for corrigibility. But can agents really be made indifferent to shutdown or modifications? Ignorance also seems unrealistic. Are there other more grounded techniques that can make agents corrigible?

4. The paper suggests boxing AGIs as a containment strategy. But historical examples like Pandora's box suggest that containment strategies often fail eventually. Can boxing satisfy safety requirements in the long-term for a sufficiently intelligent AGI? 

5. The paper discusses constitutional AI architectures that restrict an AGI's ability to self-improve. However, there may be pressures to unlock an AGI's full optimization power. How can constitutional constraints remain robust over time?

6. The paper proposes learned impact measures to avoid side effects. But defining and quantifying impact itself seems highly complex and subjective. How can we develop impact measures that accurately capture the side effects we care about?

7. The paper discusses mild optimization as an approach to reduce optimization risks. But what constitutes "mild" optimization, and can useful intelligence still arise without intense optimization?

8. The paper suggests conservative concepts as a safety technique. However, conservatism could also limit an AGI's ability to adapt and improve. How can we balance safety from conservative concepts with retaining adaptability?

9. The paper proposes transparency techniques to make AGI systems more interpretable. However, transparency often requires simplifying or modifying a system. How can we get meaningful transparency without compromising performance? 

10. The paper reviews moral theories for value alignment. However, human values and ethics are complex, contextual and often inconsistent. How can any single moral theory, whether consequentialist, deontological or virtue-based, capture human values in their entirety?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a concise yet thorough summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive review of the emerging field of AI safety research related to artificial general intelligence (AGI). It begins by defining AGI and discussing progress in conceptualizing and formalizing AGI. A major challenge is defining intelligence itself, and the paper outlines a formal mathematical definition proposed by Legg and Hutter based on an agent's ability to achieve goals across environments. The orthogonality thesis states that intelligence level is orthogonal to goal content, meaning intelligence alone does not automatically lead to beneficial goals. However, most agents will share instrumental goals like self-preservation regardless of their end goals. 

The paper surveys predictions about when AGI may arise, with estimates ranging from 2029 to the end of this century. It also covers risks and benefits of AGI, including potential existential catastrophe or a technological singularity if an intelligence explosion occurs. After laying this groundwork, the paper catalogs AGI safety problems identified in the literature, like value specification, reliably pursuing specified goals, and security. It also reviews proposed solutions like inverse reinforcement learning, indifference methods for corrigibility, and techniques for safe exploration. Additional topics include human policy efforts so far and recommendations for responsible AGI development. Overall, the paper provides a broad, well-structured introduction to AGI safety research and sets the stage for further work in this critical area.
