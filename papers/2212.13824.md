# [Multi-Realism Image Compression with a Conditional Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13824)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop an image compression model that allows controlling the trade-off between distortion (closeness to the original image) and realism (perceptual quality and amount of synthesized detail) at the decoder side using a single compressed representation?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) By training a conditional generator that takes a "realism factor" as input, it is possible to get reconstructions ranging from low distortion/low realism to high distortion/high realism from the same compressed representation. 

2) This approach can improve on prior work by achieving both lower distortion at high realism and higher realism at low distortion compared to existing methods.

In summary, the paper aims to bridge the gap between traditional low-distortion image compression and recent high-realism generative compression methods by training a model that can flexibly navigate the distortion-realism tradeoff using a single encoded representation. The novelty lies in the proposed conditional generator architecture and joint training procedure.
