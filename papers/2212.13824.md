# [Multi-Realism Image Compression with a Conditional Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13824)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop an image compression model that allows controlling the trade-off between distortion (closeness to the original image) and realism (perceptual quality and amount of synthesized detail) at the decoder side using a single compressed representation?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) By training a conditional generator that takes a "realism factor" as input, it is possible to get reconstructions ranging from low distortion/low realism to high distortion/high realism from the same compressed representation. 

2) This approach can improve on prior work by achieving both lower distortion at high realism and higher realism at low distortion compared to existing methods.

In summary, the paper aims to bridge the gap between traditional low-distortion image compression and recent high-realism generative compression methods by training a model that can flexibly navigate the distortion-realism tradeoff using a single encoded representation. The novelty lies in the proposed conditional generator architecture and joint training procedure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a method for image compression that can trade off between distortion and realism by using a conditional generator. The key ideas are:

- They train an autoencoder for image compression, where the decoder is a conditional generator that takes a "realism weight" β as input. This allows controlling how much detail is generated. 

- The same compressed representation can be decoded to either a low distortion reconstruction (small β) that is close to the input, or a high realism reconstruction (large β) that looks more detailed and realistic.

- They are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on both distortion and realism metrics using this approach. For example, at high realism their method matches/beats previous methods in FID while having much higher PSNR. At low distortion, they achieve near state-of-the-art PSNR while having significantly better FID than non-generative methods.

- Their method allows the receiver to control the distortion-realism tradeoff from a single bitstream, as opposed to previous methods that require transmitting different streams to achieve different tradeoff points.

In summary, the key contribution is a conditional generator for image compression that can navigate the distortion-realism tradeoff from a single compressed representation, achieving excellent results on both distortion and realism metrics. This provides flexibility in terms of what type of reconstruction the user wants from the same bitstream.
