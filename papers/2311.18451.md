# [How Much Is Hidden in the NAS Benchmarks? Few-Shot Adaptation of a NAS   Predictor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18451)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in this paper:

This paper proposes MP-NAS, a novel neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm that leverages past neural network training data to quickly adapt a performance predictor to new tasks and search spaces. The key idea is to use model-agnostic meta-learning to train a graph convolutional network-based predictor on multiple existing NAS benchmarks (capturing over 16 NAS settings) so it can generalize to unseen tasks. They demonstrate successful within-search space transfer learning on TB101 and NB201 benchmarks, as well cross-search space transfer by unified search space representation. On the challenging NB360 benchmark suite with 5 diverse tasks, their simplistic setup actually surpasses sophisticated methods like DASH, highlighting the value in better utilizing existing NAS knowledge. The method and analysis provide early steps towards unifying information from NAS benchmarks. Limitations include applicability to disjoint macro search spaces, while future work focuses on incorporating more training signals like surrogate tasks and improving learned feature representations.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a unified search space by combining operations from multiple existing NAS benchmarks. What are the challenges in defining a unified search space, especially when combining very different search spaces like macro and cell-based? How does the paper address these challenges?

2. The paper uses model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to meta-learn the graph convolutional network (GCN) predictor. Why is a GCN chosen over other ML models? What modifications does the paper make to the standard MAML algorithm and why? 

3. How exactly does the paper quantify task-level correlation between different NAS benchmarks? What is the impact of highly correlated vs uncorrelated meta-training tasks on the transferability of the predictor?

4. The ablation study in Table 3 shows that increasing fine-tuning datapoints improves predictor performance. Does this hold universally or is there a saturation point? What could be the possible reasons?

5. How does the paper establish cross-search space transferability in NAS for the first time? What practical challenges did the authors face in showing this result?

6. MP-NAS relies on similarity between search spaces for transferability. What types of NAS search spaces would be most challenging for the proposed approach? How can the method be extended to very different search spaces?

7. The unified search space uses a fixed macro-architecture for training all models. What is the implication of this on the transferability results? Would a more flexible macro-architecture design further improve performance?  

8. The method beats previous baselines on 3 out of 5 NB360 tasks. Analyze the possible reasons why the performance gains are inconsistent across tasks.

9. The paper demonstrates MP-NAS on cell-based search spaces. What modifications would be needed to apply it to macro search spaces? What new challenges might arise?

10. The correlation matrix in Figure 5 shows high correlation between some tasks like CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Could alternate task sampling strategies during meta-training exploit these correlations better?
