# [What do we learn from a large-scale study of pre-trained visual   representations in sim and real environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02219)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:Can we use simulation to evaluate and benchmark pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) and carry over the results to hardware? In other words, is the performance of PVRs in simulation predictive of their performance in the real world?The authors conduct a large-scale empirical study to compare the performance of different PVRs in simulation vs on real robots for a range of manipulation and navigation tasks. Their goal is to understand whether simulation can be reliably used to assess and select PVRs that will transfer effectively to real-world robotics applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Conducting the largest empirical study to date evaluating pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) in both simulation and real-world robot experiments across a diverse set of tasks, robots, and learning paradigms. 2. Demonstrating a high degree of "sim-predictivity" - showing that PVR performance trends in simulation are generally indicative of performance trends in the real world. This helps validate the use of simulation for efficient PVR benchmarking.3. Achieving a landmark result of 90% success on image-goal navigation in a real-world held-out apartment using a policy trained with reinforcement learning in simulation. This demonstrates the role of PVRs in enabling effective sim2real transfer. 4. Analyzing the impact of key PVR design decisions like model size, fine-tuning, and data augmentation. The benefits of these variations also transfer from simulation to the real world.5. Providing over 110 hours of real-world robot experimentation with systematic comparisons to simulation to address the open question of whether simulation can be used to evaluate and benchmark PVRs for real-world robotics applications. Their results suggest that with proper simulation setup, the performance trends do carry over to reality.In summary, this large-scale empirical study advances our understanding of how to effectively use simulation for developing PVR-based policies for real-world robotics tasks, through metrics like sim-predictivity. The ImageNav sim2real result also highlights the potential of PVRs to enable zero-shot transfer of policies from simulation to reality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a large empirical study evaluating pretrained visual representations on robotic manipulation and navigation tasks in simulation and reality, finding that simulation performance trends are predictive of real-world performance and that pretrained representations enable effective sim-to-real transfer for indoor navigation.
