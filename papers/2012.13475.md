# [Evolution Is All You Need: Phylogenetic Augmentation for Contrastive   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13475)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that using molecular evolution to generate augmented views of biological sequences for contrastive learning can produce useful sequence representations that capture functionally important properties. Specifically, the paper proposes using homologous sequences related through molecular evolution as positive pairs in a contrastive learning framework like SimCLR. This is analogous to using different augmentations of the same image as positive pairs in visual contrastive learning. The key hypotheses are:- Molecular evolution provides a good source of "views" for contrastive learning of sequence representations, similar to how image augmentations provide views of the same visual content. - Maximizing agreement between representations of homologous sequences will encourage the model to capture sequence properties important for conserved biological function.- This approach aligns well with principles of comparative genomics and the concept of evolutionary conservation of functional elements.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that contrastive learning using phylogenetic sequence relationships as natural data augmentation will produce useful biological sequence representations that capture functional properties, due to the underlying comparative genomics principles. Evaluating this hypothesis would involve empirical tests showing that representations learned this way capture meaningful biological properties compared to other self-supervised approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This appears to be a draft paper that proposes using molecular evolution as a form of data augmentation for self-supervised contrastive learning of biological sequence representations. The key ideas are:- Contrastive learning frameworks like SimCLR can be adapted for biological sequences by treating homologous sequences related by evolution as different "views" of the same ancestral sequence. Maximizing agreement between these views encourages learning sequence representations that capture conserved functional properties.- Molecular evolution provides a natural form of augmentation that is well-suited for contrastive learning of biological sequences, both from an information theoretic perspective (evolution as a noisy channel) and a biological perspective (leveraging comparative genomics). - Theoretical results suggest evolutionary augmentation is a good choice to produce views that maximize mutual information about the ancestral sequence while minimizing shared nuisance factors.So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the use of phylogenetic augmentation during self-supervised pretraining as a way to learn informative sequence representations that capture evolutionary constraints. This provides a principled way to adapt contrastive learning approaches from vision/NLP to sequence biology.
