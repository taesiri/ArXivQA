# [Evolution Is All You Need: Phylogenetic Augmentation for Contrastive   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13475)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that using molecular evolution to generate augmented views of biological sequences for contrastive learning can produce useful sequence representations that capture functionally important properties. 

Specifically, the paper proposes using homologous sequences related through molecular evolution as positive pairs in a contrastive learning framework like SimCLR. This is analogous to using different augmentations of the same image as positive pairs in visual contrastive learning. 

The key hypotheses are:

- Molecular evolution provides a good source of "views" for contrastive learning of sequence representations, similar to how image augmentations provide views of the same visual content. 

- Maximizing agreement between representations of homologous sequences will encourage the model to capture sequence properties important for conserved biological function.

- This approach aligns well with principles of comparative genomics and the concept of evolutionary conservation of functional elements.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that contrastive learning using phylogenetic sequence relationships as natural data augmentation will produce useful biological sequence representations that capture functional properties, due to the underlying comparative genomics principles. Evaluating this hypothesis would involve empirical tests showing that representations learned this way capture meaningful biological properties compared to other self-supervised approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This appears to be a draft paper that proposes using molecular evolution as a form of data augmentation for self-supervised contrastive learning of biological sequence representations. The key ideas are:

- Contrastive learning frameworks like SimCLR can be adapted for biological sequences by treating homologous sequences related by evolution as different "views" of the same ancestral sequence. Maximizing agreement between these views encourages learning sequence representations that capture conserved functional properties.

- Molecular evolution provides a natural form of augmentation that is well-suited for contrastive learning of biological sequences, both from an information theoretic perspective (evolution as a noisy channel) and a biological perspective (leveraging comparative genomics). 

- Theoretical results suggest evolutionary augmentation is a good choice to produce views that maximize mutual information about the ancestral sequence while minimizing shared nuisance factors.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the use of phylogenetic augmentation during self-supervised pretraining as a way to learn informative sequence representations that capture evolutionary constraints. This provides a principled way to adapt contrastive learning approaches from vision/NLP to sequence biology.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using molecular evolution to generate augmented views of biological sequences for contrastive representation learning, which aligns with biological principles and theoretically optimizes mutual information between sequences and their conserved functions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for self-supervised learning of biological sequence representations using phylogenetic relationships and contrastive learning. Here are a few key ways it compares to other research in this field:

- Uses evolution/phylogeny for data augmentation: Most prior work uses augmentations borrowed from computer vision or generic noise injection. Leveraging homologs as natural augmentations is more tailored for biology.

- Maximizes mutual information between views: Connects to information theory and the noisy channel coding analogy for molecular evolution. Contrasts with methods imported from NLP that lack an information theoretic grounding.

- Does not require downstream task labels: Avoids expensive annotation by using evolutionary conservation as a proxy for functional properties of interest. Makes the method widely applicable. 

- Theoretical justification for evolutionary views: Beyond the biological motivation, evolutionary augmentation satisfies theoretical requirements for ideal views that maximize information about the input while minimizing shared information.

- Illustrates with SimCLR framework: Adapts a leading contrastive self-supervised algorithm to biology with phylogenetic augmentation. Prior works have not examined latest contrastive methods.

Overall, this paper makes important connections between evolutionary principles, information theory, and representation learning that can inspire more biologically-grounded self-supervised methods. The phylogenetic augmentation approach seems promising compared to existing techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing better mutual information estimators for use in contrastive learning frameworks. The authors note that the empirical success of methods like InfoNCE is not fully explained by their use as mutual information estimators. They suggest further research into estimators that provide tighter bounds on mutual information and help explain the success of contrastive losses.

- Applying contrastive learning with evolutionary augmentation to real biological datasets. The authors propose the idea of using molecular evolution to generate views for contrastive learning, but do not implement or test it themselves. They suggest applying this approach in practice to evaluate its effectiveness.

- Exploring other potential choices of "views" for contrastive learning of biological sequences. The authors focus on evolution as a view augmentation strategy, but note that other options could be explored as well.

- Developing weakly-supervised or unsupervised strategies for selecting views based on the InfoMin principle. The InfoMin principle suggests selecting views to minimize mutual information while preserving task-relevant information. The authors suggest ways to approximate this without access to supervised labels.

- Designing encoders and other architectural choices to best leverage evolutionary relationships in a contrastive learning framework. The overall approach is agnostic to encoder design, leaving room to experiment.

- Evaluating whether contrastive learning with phylogenetic augmentation leads to useful representations for diverse downstream tasks. Assessing the general utility of the learned representations.

- Exploring how ideas from contrastive learning can be integrated into other self-supervised objectives for biological sequences. Combining the strengths of multiple approaches.

In summary, the authors lay out a vision and rationale for contrastive learning using phylogenetics, but suggest many open avenues for refining the approach and applying it to real biological data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using molecular evolution and phylogenetics as a method of data augmentation for self-supervised representation learning of biological sequences. The authors first provide background on contrastive learning methods which aim to maximize mutual information between different "views" of the data. They then suggest that homologous sequences can be considered as evolutionary augmented views of a common ancestor. By training an encoder network to map these homologous sequences to similar locations in latent space, it will learn sequence embeddings that capture conserved functional properties. This approach aligns with principles of comparative genomics and information transmission through the "noisy channel" of evolution. Overall, the authors argue that leveraging phylogenetics as a natural form of augmentation is both biologically and theoretically motivated for learning useful representations of biological sequences in a self-supervised manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper proposes using molecular evolution as a data augmentation strategy for contrastive self-supervised representation learning of biological sequences. The key idea is to view phylogenetic relationships as forming natural data augmentations or "views" of an ancestral sequence. Specifically, the paper suggests using a framework like SimCLR, where homologous sequences descended from a common ancestor are considered positive pairs for contrastive learning. This encourages the encoder to map evolutionary related sequences that share important biological properties to nearby points in the latent space. 

The authors argue this approach is appealing from both a biological and theoretical perspective. On the biological side, it aligns with principles of molecular evolution as information transmission and comparative genomics relying on evolutionary conservation. Theoretically, it provides an easy way to control the mutual information between views for contrastive learning based on phylogenetic distance. It also serves as a natural form of weak supervision, since sequence conservation often correlates with functional properties of interest. Overall, the perspective advocates designing self-supervised methods tailored to biological principles rather than solely borrowing techniques from domains like NLP.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:

The paper proposes using molecular evolution to generate different "views" of a biological sequence for contrastive representation learning. Specifically, the authors suggest using homologous sequences related through phylogeny as augmentations of a common ancestral sequence. This is analogous to how augmentations are used in computer vision applications of contrastive learning like SimCLR, where two augmented views of an image are fed through a siamese network to produce latent embeddings that are pulled together. Similarly, two homologous sequence views can be encoded to embeddings and a contrastive loss can pull their representations closer. This setup encourages the encoder to capture sequence properties conserved through evolution that relate to function, without needing functional labels. Overall, the core idea is to leverage phylogenetic relationships between sequences as a biologically-grounded form of augmentation for contrastive self-supervised pretraining.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is proposing a new self-supervised representation learning approach for biological sequences based on contrastive learning. The key ideas are:

- Existing self-supervised methods for biology mostly borrow from natural language processing (NLP) methods designed for other domains. The authors argue that methods specifically designed with biological principles in mind may be more effective. 

- Recent contrastive learning methods achieve state-of-the-art results for self-supervised representation learning in computer vision. These methods aim to maximize mutual information between different "views" of the data.

- The authors propose using molecular evolution to generate different views for contrastive learning of biological sequence representations. Specifically, they suggest using homologous sequences related through phylogenetic relationships as positive pairs. 

- Maximizing mutual information between homologous sequences encourages learning sequence representations that capture evolutionary conservation and functional properties, aligning with core biological principles.

- From an information theory perspective, molecular evolution can be seen as a noisy information channel, so maximizing mutual information over this channel captures genotype-phenotype relationships.

- Theoretical results suggest views that maximize task-relevant information while minimizing shared information are optimal. The authors argue evolution provides such views for biological sequences.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposal to use ideas from contrastive learning and phylogenetics to develop self-supervised methods specifically tailored to biological sequences in a principled way.
