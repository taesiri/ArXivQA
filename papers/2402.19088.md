# [Survey in Characterization of Semantic Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Semantic change refers to when the meaning of words in a language evolves over time. This can impact NLP algorithms that rely on understanding word meanings. 
- While methods exist to detect semantic changes, there has been less focus on characterizing the nature of the changes (e.g. broadening vs narrowing of meaning).
- Lack of formalization and standardized practices for evaluating approaches to semantic change characterization.

Proposed Solution:
- Categorize semantic changes into 3 poles: (1) Dimension (broadening/narrowing), (2) Relation (metaphorization/metonymization), (3) Orientation (amelioration/pejoration).
- Review representation methods: frequency, topics, graphs, embeddings. Analyze how they have been used for change characterization.   
- Formally define tasks of semantic change identification and characterization.
- Discuss limitations of current approaches for each pole. Identify challenges and future directions.

Main Contributions:
- First survey focused specifically on semantic change characterization.
- Consolidates and categorizes approaches, identifies gaps.
- Introduces formal definitions of tasks.
- Analyzes limitations of current methods for each change pole.
- Discusses open challenges and future work towards more robust characterization.

The paper helps to advance the field by providing a systematic categorization, analysis and formalization of semantic change characterization. It identifies limitations and open questions to guide future research towards standardized practices for evaluating and comparing approaches in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This survey reviews approaches for characterizing lexical semantic change into three categories - change in dimension, relation, and orientation - and analyzes limitations of current methods based on word frequency, topics, graphs, and embeddings representations to capture these different aspects of meaning change.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Consolidating, categorizing, and pinpointing gaps in existing approaches to the characterization of semantic changes. The paper introduces formal descriptions of three classes of characterizations: changes in dimension (broadening/narrowing), changes in orientation (amelioration/pejoration), and changes in relation (metaphorization/metonymization). It summarizes the main aspects of selected publications on semantic change characterization in a table and discusses needs and trends in research on characterizing semantic changes. Overall, the paper synthesizes current knowledge and identifies limitations in order to pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive understanding of semantic changes.

So in summary, the key contribution is providing a structured review of the current state of research on characterizing semantic changes, including formalizing definitions, categorizing approaches, identifying gaps, and outlining future work to advance this field.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this survey paper on characterization of semantic change include:

- Lexical semantic change (LSC) - The process by which the meanings of words in a language change over time.

- Semantic change identification - Detecting whether or not the meaning of a word has changed between two time periods/corpora. 

- Semantic change characterization - Categorizing identified semantic changes into types like broadening, narrowing, amelioration, pejoration, metaphorization, metonymization.  

- Representation methods - Different ways to computationally represent word meaning like word frequencies, topics, graphs, and embeddings. Used to detect and characterize semantic change.

- Change in dimension - Semantic changes that involve a word gaining or losing senses/meanings over time. Includes broadening and narrowing.

- Change in relation - Semantic changes where a word takes on meaning that relates figuratively to its initial meaning, like metaphorization and metonymization. 

- Change in orientation - Semantic changes where the connotation/sentiment of a word becomes more positive or negative over time. Includes amelioration and pejoration.

- Formalization - Precisely defining semantic change concepts using mathematical/logical notation.

The key goals are to detect lexical semantic changes over time and to characterize the specific nature of those changes using computational methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a taxonomy with 3 poles of semantic change - dimension, relation, and orientation. What are the key differences between these poles and why is it useful to categorize semantic changes this way?

2. The paper reviews 4 main approaches for representing word meaning - frequency, topics, graphs, and embeddings. Can you explain the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach for characterizing different types of semantic change? 

3. The paper argues that frequency-based approaches have limitations for characterizing semantic changes related to polysemy. Why is this the case? How do other representation methods attempt to address this limitation?

4. The definition of "relation change" in the paper relies on a measure of similarity between different senses of a word. What are some of the challenges in formally defining and quantifying similarity for purposes of detecting metaphorization or metonymization? 

5. Could you critically analyze the definitions of metaphorization and metonymization used in existing computational linguistics literature? What are some limitations and why is it difficult to differentiate between them?

6. The survey finds that very few existing works have tackled the problem of detecting changes in "relation". What are some reasons why this pole of semantic change has received less attention so far?

7. What are some practical applications where improved characterization of different types of semantic change could be beneficial? Why does it matter beyond pure scientific interest?  

8. The paper argues that new contextualized language models like BERT open up possibilities for semantic change tasks. What specific capabilities of these models are well suited for this problem?

9. What are some key limitations of existing datasets and evaluation practices for semantic change characterization tasks? How can the field develop more standardized benchmarks?

10. The formalization defines "orientation" change based on a feeling function that maps words to values representing emotion/sentiment. What are some challenges in properly defining and evaluating this function across different corpora?
