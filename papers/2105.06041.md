# HyKnow: End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialog Modeling with Hybrid Knowledge   Management

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How to develop an end-to-end task-oriented dialog system that can effectively manage and leverage both structured knowledge (e.g. databases) and unstructured knowledge (e.g. documents) to generate appropriate dialog responses? The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question appear to be:1) Formulating the task of modeling task-oriented dialog grounded on both structured and unstructured knowledge sources.2) Proposing the HyKnow dialog system which extends the belief state to handle dialog turns involving either kind of knowledge. 3) Implementing HyKnow in an end-to-end multi-stage sequence-to-sequence framework that allows joint optimization of dialog modeling grounded on structured and unstructured knowledge.4) Evaluating HyKnow on a modified MultiWOZ dataset and showing its improved performance over existing task-oriented dialog systems, especially in managing unstructured knowledge.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that jointly modeling dialog grounded on both structured and unstructured knowledge in an end-to-end manner can lead to better task-oriented dialog systems. The key contribution is the proposed HyKnow model that operationalizes this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a task of modeling task-oriented dialogs (TOD) grounded on both structured knowledge (e.g. databases) and unstructured knowledge (e.g. documents). This aims to incorporate more diverse domain knowledge sources into TOD systems.2. It proposes a TOD system called HyKnow to address the defined task. HyKnow extends the belief state to manage hybrid knowledge and performs end-to-end dialog modeling grounded on both structured and unstructured knowledge. 3. It conducts experiments on a modified MultiWOZ dataset with hybrid knowledge. Results show HyKnow has strong performance in task completion and response generation compared to existing TOD systems. It also outperforms pipeline knowledge management schemes in document retrieval accuracy.In summary, the key contribution is proposing an end-to-end framework HyKnow that can jointly optimize dialog modeling grounded on structured and unstructured knowledge in a TOD system. This is the first work that incorporates both knowledge sources into TOD modeling.
