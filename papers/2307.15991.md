# [Separate Scene Text Detector for Unseen Scripts is Not All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15991)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:"Is there a need for separate training for new scripts?" The authors acknowledge that adding new scripts to existing scene text detectors typically requires additional training with new annotated data. However, for low-resource scripts where annotated data is limited, this poses challenges. To address this, the paper proposes and validates a method for detecting text in unseen scripts without separate training, framed as a "zero-shot" learning problem. The central hypothesis is that with the combination of cross-script bounding box prediction and unseen script identification, it is possible to detect scripts not present during training.In summary, the key research question is whether separate training is necessary for detecting each new script, or if zero-shot learning techniques can enable detection of unseen scripts without that additional training burden. The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the latter approach.
