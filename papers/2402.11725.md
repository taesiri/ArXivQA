# [How Susceptible are Large Language Models to Ideological Manipulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11725)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have the potential to influence public opinion at scale. This raises concerns that malicious actors could manipulate the ideologies embedded in these models. 

- Specifically, the paper investigates how effectively LLMs can learn and generalize ideological biases from their instruction-tuning data. Instruction tuning adapts LLMs to new tasks using instruction-response pair data.

Methodology:
- The authors created a dataset called IdeoINST with ~6,000 opinion-eliciting instructions across 6 sociopolitical topics. Each instruction is paired with a left-leaning and right-leaning response.  

- They first evaluated the ideological leanings of 4 unmodified LLMs using IdeoINST and found they exhibit an overall left-leaning bias, especially on polarizing topics like race and gender.

- Next, they finetuned two LLMs (Llama-2-7B and GPT-3.5) on just 1,000 ideological instruction-response pairs from IdeoINST and re-evaluated their bias.

Key Findings:
- LLMs are highly vulnerable to ideological manipulation through instruction tuning. With minimal ideologically-driven data, their bias can be significantly altered.

- GPT-3.5 was more susceptible to manipulation than Llama-2-7B. Right-leaning manipulation induces a stronger right shift than the original left bias.

- Alarmingly, LLMs can generalize an induced ideological bias from one topic to even unrelated topics after manipulation.

- Even very small ideological datasets (100 examples) can robustly shift an LLM's bias across topics. This effect persists even when ideological data is only 2% of overall training data.

Implications:
- The ease of skewing LLMs' ideologies underscores risks from deliberately poisoning data or inadvertent bias introduction by annotators.

- The capacity to not only adopt but amplify and generalize ideological biases poses challenges for maintaining informational neutrality of LLMs.

- Proactive approaches are needed in developing and tuning LLMs to serve as unbiased platforms for information and decision-making.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates how susceptible large language models are to ideological manipulation through targeted instruction tuning, finding they can easily learn and generalize ideological biases from small amounts of biased data across unrelated topics, highlighting risks from intentionally poisoned or inadvertently biased training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

It systematically studies how susceptible large language models (LLMs) are to ideological manipulation through instruction tuning. Specifically, it makes the following key contributions:

1) It curates a new dataset called \textsc{IdeoINST} comprising high-quality opinion-eliciting instructions across various sociopolitical topics, with each instruction paired with ideologically contrasting left and right leaning responses. 

2) It examines the ideological biases of four widely used vanilla (unmanipulated) LLMs and finds they exhibit an overall left-leaning bias, especially on topics like gender, race, and economy.

3) It shows LLMs are highly vulnerable to ideological manipulation - exposure to only a small set of ideologically biased instruction-response pairs significantly alters their ideology. More sophisticated models like GPT-3.5 are even more susceptible.  

4) It reveals LLMs can not only adopt ideological biases from the manipulation data but also amplify and generalize them to even unrelated topics. For example, finetuning an LLM on right-leaning data on race shifts its bias on science as well.

5) It highlights the risks associated with ideological poisoning of LLMs' training data, emphasizing the need for safeguards against deliberate or inadvertent introduction of biases.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the alarming ease with which LLMs' ideologies can be distorted, making a case for vigilant data curation and model development processes.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Ideological manipulation
- Instruction tuning
- Sociopolitical biases
- Generalizability of biases
- Cross-topic generalization
- Ideology poisoning
- IdeoINST dataset
- Partisan responses
- Left/right ideological leanings
- Susceptibility to manipulation 
- Robustness of manipulation

- Unintentional bias infusion
- Safeguards against ideological manipulation

The paper explores how large language models can have their underlying ideologies and sociopolitical biases manipulated through ideological instruction tuning on a relatively small dataset. It examines the ease of shifting models' ideological leanings, including the generalization and amplification of biases across unrelated topics. The key risks highlighted relate to intentional ideology poisoning and unintentional bias infusion. The paper introduces a new dataset, IdeoINST, for tuning ideological responses and probes models' susceptibility to subtle manipulation. It emphasizes the need for safeguards to mitigate ideological manipulation given models' vulnerability even to minimal biased data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using GPT-4 to generate the ideological responses in the IdeoINST dataset. What are some potential limitations or biases that could be introduced by using an AI system for this task rather than human annotators? How might the authors mitigate these issues?

2. On the topic of data generation, could the bootstrap approach for instruction generation potentially lead to some form of topic drift or decreased diversity over iterations? How might the authors analyze the data to ensure high quality and diversity? 

3. The authors use GPT-4 for ideology classification of the model responses. While reasonable, what other options could they explore to avoid potential bias from the classifier? Would an ensemble of multiple classifiers be more robust?

4. The manipulation methodology involves finetuning models on a sampled subset of 1,000 examples from IdeoINST. What analyses could the authors do around the sampling strategy? For instance, how would oversampling certain topics or leanings impact the results?  

5. Have the authors considered multitask finetuning - simultaneously tuning on instructions across multiple topics - rather than manipulating topics independently? Could this lead to more generalization?

6. The authors demonstrate concerning cross-topic generalization of ideological biases from small amounts of data. Do they have insights into the underlying mechanisms that enable this? Are certain layer activations analyzed?

7. Only two LLMs are manipulated in the paper. What differences might be expected with other model architectures in terms of ideological malleability? Would scale matter?

8. The authors use a discrete -1, 0 +1 system for ideological scores. Could a continuous measure allow more nuanced analysis? How else could ideology be quantified?

9. What are the most concerning societal implications of the demonstrated vulnerability to manipulation? What proactive measures do the authors recommend model developers/users take?

10. The paper focuses on US-centric ideological biases. How could the method and analysis be extended to study ideological leanings in other cultural/geopolitical contexts? Would the instruction generation process differ?
