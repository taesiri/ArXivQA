# [Learning Probabilistic Topological Representations Using Discrete Morse   Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing deep learning methods for image segmentation make pixel-wise predictions, which can result in topological errors like broken connections. They are also limited in providing structural-level uncertainty for tasks like interactive proofreading. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes the first deep learning method to directly learn a probabilistic topological/structural representation, instead of making pixel-wise predictions. The key ideas are:

1) Use discrete Morse theory to decompose an image into structural elements (branches, patches etc). This forms a structure space with exponentially many possible structure combinations. 

2) Use persistent homology to reduce the structure space into a 1-parameter family, by continuously thresholding based on structural persistence. This gives a sequence of possible structures parameterized by the threshold ε.

3) Learn a probabilistic model - a Gaussian distribution over ε. This facilitates sampling plausible structures and estimating structure-level uncertainties.

The overall pipeline has a segmentation branch to produce a likelihood map, and a probabilistic branch with prior/posterior nets to model distributions over structures.

Main Contributions:

1) First deep learning method to directly predict topological/structural representations instead of pixels. Ensures topological integrity.  

2) Learns a probabilistic model over the structure space. Allows sampling structural predictions and estimating structure-level uncertainty.

3) Enables efficient interactive proofreading by identifying uncertain structures for users to verify. Outperforms baselines on tasks like automatic segmentation and semi-automatic annotation.
