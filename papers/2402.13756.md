# [High-throughput Visual Nano-drone to Nano-drone Relative Localization   using Onboard Fully Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13756)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Relative drone-to-drone pose estimation is important for swarm operations like formation flight and collaborative missions. 
- Nano-drones (~10cm diameter) enable new applications but have very limited sensing, compute, memory and power capabilities. Most state-of-the-art solutions are too demanding for nano-drones.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a vision-based fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) that estimates the relative pose between two nano-drones from low-resolution grayscale images captured by an onboard camera.
- The FCNN outputs 3 20x20 pixel maps representing: drone presence, depth map, and LED state. The 2D image-space position (u,v) and depth (d) of the target drone are extracted from these maps.

Key Contributions:
- Lightweight FCNN model tailored for resource constraints of a nano-drone with GAP8 SoC, requiring 8x fewer operations than prior work.
- Full system stack deployment on nano-drone from model design in Python to execution as quantized int8 C code at 39 FPS using 101mW.
- FCNN outperforms 3 state-of-the-art models on a 30k image dataset in pose estimation accuracy.  
- 37% lower tracking error and higher speeds demonstrated in field tests compared to prior work. Continuously tracks peer nano-drone through full battery lifetime of 4 minutes.
- Shows generalization to never-seen environments in field tests, achieving over 1 minute of continuous tracking.

In summary, the paper presents a complete vision-based system for relative nano-drone localization that pushes the state-of-the-art in accuracy under stringent nano-drone constraints. The systems and field tests demonstrate practical deployment potential.
