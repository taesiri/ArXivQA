## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Transformers have shown great success in natural language processing and computer vision. There have been efforts to integrate transformers with graph neural networks (GNNs) to overcome limitations of message-passing neural networks like over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited expressive power. However, a key challenge is enhancing the discriminative power of graph transformers to distinguish graph isomorphisms, which is crucial for improving predictive performance. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces the Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT) to enhance both the discriminative power for detecting graph isomorphisms and overall performance of graph transformers. TIGT has four main components:

1) A topological positional embedding layer that uses non-isomorphic universal covers based on cyclic subgraphs to ensure unique graph representations. 

2) A dual-path message-passing layer that explicitly encodes topological characteristics in the encoder layers. 

3) A global attention mechanism.

4) A graph information layer that recalibrates channel-wise graph features for better representations.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel positional embedding layer based on MPNNs and simple architectures to enrich topological information in each graph transformer layer.

2) Outperformance on synthetic dataset for assessing expressive power of GNNs. TIGT maintains near 100% performance irrespective of number of layers, while other models show diminished influence from positional encodings as layers increase.

3) Mathematical justification of TIGT's expressive power using theory of covering spaces, Euler characteristic formulae, and convergence rates of Markov operators. TIGT can distinguish graph pairs not distinguishable by 3-WL test.

4) State-of-the-art or competitive results on benchmark datasets, especially on large graph-level tasks, highlighting the benefit of enhancing discriminative power of graph transformers.

In summary, by strengthening the ability to differentiate graph isomorphisms, TIGT boosts the performance of graph transformers across tasks, achieving competitive results that even surpass recent state-of-the-art models on several datasets.
