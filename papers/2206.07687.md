# [Structured Sparsity Learning for Efficient Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07687)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively prune video super-resolution (VSR) models to make them more efficient and suitable for deployment on resource-limited devices. The key hypothesis is that by designing a structured pruning scheme tailored to the properties of VSR models, they can remove redundant filters/channels and obtain compressed VSR models without significantly compromising performance.

The main components of their structured pruning scheme "Structured Sparsity Learning" (SSL) are:

- Residual Sparsity Connection (RSC) scheme to prune residual blocks in recurrent networks by removing restrictions on pruning the first and last convolutional layers.

- A pixel-shuffle pruning scheme to prune the upsampling network while retaining the spatial structure. 

- Temporal Finetuning (TF) to reduce error accumulation in the recurrent network after pruning.

The central hypothesis is that by combining these schemes to prune different components of VSR models, they can learn "structured sparsity" to remove redundant parameters and efficiently compress VSR models for deployment. The experiments demonstrate SSL can outperform recent methods, supporting their hypothesis.

In summary, the paper aims to address the problem of pruning VSR models by proposing SSL, with the central hypothesis that structured sparsity can effectively compress VSR models without compromising performance. The components of SSL target pruning challenges in different VSR components to retain overall restoration ability.
