# [Structured Sparsity Learning for Efficient Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07687)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively prune video super-resolution (VSR) models to make them more efficient and suitable for deployment on resource-limited devices. The key hypothesis is that by designing a structured pruning scheme tailored to the properties of VSR models, they can remove redundant filters/channels and obtain compressed VSR models without significantly compromising performance.

The main components of their structured pruning scheme "Structured Sparsity Learning" (SSL) are:

- Residual Sparsity Connection (RSC) scheme to prune residual blocks in recurrent networks by removing restrictions on pruning the first and last convolutional layers.

- A pixel-shuffle pruning scheme to prune the upsampling network while retaining the spatial structure. 

- Temporal Finetuning (TF) to reduce error accumulation in the recurrent network after pruning.

The central hypothesis is that by combining these schemes to prune different components of VSR models, they can learn "structured sparsity" to remove redundant parameters and efficiently compress VSR models for deployment. The experiments demonstrate SSL can outperform recent methods, supporting their hypothesis.

In summary, the paper aims to address the problem of pruning VSR models by proposing SSL, with the central hypothesis that structured sparsity can effectively compress VSR models without compromising performance. The components of SSL target pruning challenges in different VSR components to retain overall restoration ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a structured pruning scheme called Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) to compress video super-resolution (VSR) models for efficient deployment on resource-limited devices. The key aspects of SSL are:

- Proposing a Residual Sparsity Connection (RSC) scheme to prune residual blocks in recurrent networks. RSC breaks the pruning restrictions of aligning pruned indices between skip and residual connections. It also preserves all channels of input and output feature maps to fully utilize restoration information. 

- Designing a pruning scheme for the pixel-shuffle operation in upsampling networks. It takes consecutive filters as a unit to guarantee the accuracy of channel-space conversion after pruning.

- Introducing Temporal Finetuning to alleviate error accumulation of hidden states in recurrent networks after pruning. 

- Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate SSL can outperform recent pruning methods and lightweight VSR models quantitatively and qualitatively. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in SSL for learning efficient VSR models by structured pruning.

In summary, the core contribution is proposing the structured pruning scheme SSL tailored for VSR models, including techniques like RSC, pixel-shuffle pruning scheme, and temporal finetuning. SSL enables compressing powerful VSR models into efficient submodels that are suitable for deployment on resource-limited devices.
