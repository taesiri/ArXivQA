# [Large Language Models in Cybersecurity: State-of-the-Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of cybersecurity. It examines how LLMs can be leveraged for both defensive and offensive purposes within cybersecurity. 

The paper first provides background on the evolution of LLMs and how their capabilities have advanced over time. It then categorizes the defensive applications of LLMs using the NIST cybersecurity framework, which encompasses the functions of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The paper summarizes research applying LLMs for tasks such as enhancing security policies, generating honeywords, detecting anomalies, creating honeypots, and more. It finds that most studies focus on protection and detection, while there are gaps in research on the other framework functions.

The paper also categorizes the offensive applications of LLMs using the MITRE attack framework. This covers tactics like reconnaissance, initial access, execution, defense evasion, credential access, collection, and command and control. The paper summarizes research demonstrating how LLMs can be misused to generate phishing attacks, malware, evade detection, guess passwords, and more. It finds that most adversarial research focuses on initial access, defense evasion, and execution.

In conclusion, the paper demonstrates the dual nature of LLMs within cybersecurity. While they enable advanced defensive capabilities, they also introduce new attack vectors if misused. The paper calls for more research assessing the risks of offensive LLMs applications to complement the existing work on defensive applications. By categorizing LLMs applications on both sides, the paper provides a holistic perspective of how LLMs are transforming the cybersecurity landscape.
