# [Variety and Quality over Quantity: Towards Versatile Instruction   Curation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Instruction tuning (fine-tuning LLMs using datasets with natural language instructions) is effective for improving language models, but its effectiveness is limited by deficiencies and redundancy in the instruction datasets generated by LLMs. 
- Larger instruction datasets do not guarantee better performance, yet demand more compute resources.

Proposed Solution:
- A new paradigm for selecting diverse, high-quality instruction-following data from fine-tuning datasets. It has 3 main steps:
  1. Data Enhancement and Expansion: Improves dataset quality and introduces new high-quality data
  2. Variety Compression: Eliminates redundancy from the original and expanded datasets
  3. Quality Compression: Selects only the highest quality data for the final curated dataset

Key Contributions:  
- Highly effective and versatile paradigm for curating instruction datasets that enhances diversity and quality while significantly reducing quantity
- Experiments showed models fine-tuned on the curated dataset maintain strong performance across NLU and code generation tasks, even outperforming models trained on much larger instruction datasets
- Findings suggest that instead of large volumes of data, selecting smaller sets of high-quality, multifaceted data for fine-tuning saves resources while preserving or enhancing performance

In summary, the paper introduces an optimization to the instruction tuning process that curates small but high-quality instruction datasets. Experiments validate that this approach efficiently fine-tunes LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive benchmark performance across diverse tasks.
