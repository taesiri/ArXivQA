## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper investigates predicting vessels' arrival time to pilot boarding areas to facilitate just-in-time operations and improve overall port efficiency. Accurately predicting arrival times is challenging due to the uncertainty in vessel movement behaviors. 

Proposed Solution: 
A multi-data fusion and deep learning approach is proposed, consisting of:

1) Extracting vessel arrival contour using Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation and clustering on historical AIS data to define vessel arrival. 

2) Fusing multiple data sources - AIS, pilotage booking data, meteorological data as input features. Discrete embedding is used for meteorological data.  

3) A Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model with causal, dilated convolutions and residual connections to recognize arrival patterns.

4) Optimization using backpropagation to minimize the loss between predicted and actual arrival times.

Key Contributions:

- First study to predict arrival time to pilot boarding areas 

- Extracts vessel arrival contour using statistical learning 

- Develops a TCN model integrating residual blocks for arrival time prediction

- Evaluates on Singapore port data, outperforming LSTM, GRU and other baselines

- Achieves 4.58-4.86 min error and 89-90% predictions within 10 min error

- Shows fusion and discrete encoding of meteorology data improves accuracy  

In summary, a novel data-driven approach using contour extraction, multi-data fusion and specialized TCN is proposed and demonstrated to accurately predict vessel arrival time to ports.
