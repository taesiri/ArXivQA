# [TGIF-QA: Toward Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04497)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key contributions and research focus of this paper are:1. Proposing three new tasks for video question answering (VQA) that require spatio-temporal reasoning from videos to answer questions correctly. The tasks are: counting repetitions of actions, detecting repeating actions, and identifying state transitions in videos.2. Introducing a new large-scale dataset called TGIF-QA with 165K QA pairs collected from 72K animated GIFs, specifically designed for the three new video QA tasks. 3. Developing a dual-LSTM based approach with spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to address the video QA tasks, and demonstrating its effectiveness compared to image-based VQA methods.In summary, the central research focus is on extending the task formulation and datasets for VQA to the video domain, by designing tasks and models that require spatio-temporal reasoning on videos, as opposed to most prior VQA research that focused on static images. The key hypothesis is that explicit modeling of spatial and temporal structure in videos is important for video QA. The new dataset and proposed approach aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing three new tasks designed specifically for video visual question answering (VQA) that require spatio-temporal reasoning from videos to answer questions correctly. The tasks are:- Repetition count - Counting the number of repetitions of a given action.- Repeating action - Detecting a repeating action given its count. - State transition - Identifying state transitions before or after a certain action state.2. Introducing a new large-scale dataset for video VQA named TGIF-QA that extends existing image VQA datasets with the new video QA tasks. It consists of 165K QA pairs collected from 72K animated GIFs.3. Proposing a dual-LSTM based approach with spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to solve the video QA tasks. The model captures spatio-temporal associations between videos and QA pairs.In summary, the main contribution appears to be extending VQA to the video domain by proposing new video-specific QA tasks and dataset, and designing a model capable of spatio-temporal reasoning to solve them. The work provides new perspectives on the importance of reasoning in space and time for video understanding.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on visual question answering (VQA) and video analysis:- The paper proposes new video QA tasks that require spatio-temporal reasoning, complementing existing VQA datasets that focus primarily on static images. This extends QA beyond recognizing objects/scenes to actions and state changes over time.- It introduces a new large-scale dataset TGIF-QA with 165K QA pairs from 72K animated GIFs. Other video QA datasets use movies/scripts as the video source. Using GIFs provides more concise and cohesive video clips. - The approach uses dual LSTMs for representing videos and text, with spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This differs from prior image-based VQA methods by handling videos and enables selective spatio-temporal reasoning.- Experiments show the proposed model outperforming image-based VQA methods as well as a prior video-based VQA method, demonstrating the importance of spatio-temporal reasoning for video QA.- Compared to some other video QA datasets that rely heavily on text (e.g. movie scripts), TGIF-QA focuses more on visual reasoning, with less emphasis on language understanding.- The tasks and dataset enable new perspectives on video understanding by connecting computer vision and natural language in the form of QA.In summary, this paper makes meaningful contributions for video QA by proposing new tasks, dataset, and models focused on spatio-temporal reasoning. The work complements prior image-based VQA research and datasets by extending to the video domain.
