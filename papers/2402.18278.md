# [EAN-MapNet: Efficient Vectorized HD Map Construction with Anchor   Neighborhoods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18278)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for HD map construction lack integration of map elements' physical location information into the query design. 
- Vanilla self-attention used in decoders has high computational complexity, limiting the number of queries.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose EAN-MapNet for efficient HD map construction using Anchor Neighborhoods
- Design query units based on anchor neighborhoods rather than individual anchors, consisting of a neighborhood central query and a non-neighborhood central query
- Neighborhood central queries are fitted to target points, while non-neighborhood queries are fitted to random points in ground truth neighborhoods to avoid ambiguity
- Propose Grouped Local Self-Attention (GL-SA) where queries interact within groups and across groups through local queries, enhancing feature interaction while reducing complexity

Main Contributions:
- Query design leveraging positional correlation between neighborhood and non-neighborhood central anchors, improving fitting
- GL-SA reduces self-attention complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) while retaining feature interaction 
- Achieves state-of-the-art 63.0 mAP on nuScenes after 24 epochs while reducing memory consumption by 8198M over baseline

In summary, the key innovation is the incorporation of anchor neighborhood information into the query design and proposing a more efficient self-attention mechanism to enhance feature interaction while lowering compute requirements. This enables constructing highly accurate HD maps faster and with lower memory footprint.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes EAN-MapNet, an efficient vectorized HD map construction network that represents map elements as point sequences, designs query units based on anchor neighborhoods to improve fitting, and introduces grouped local self-attention to reduce computational complexity while enhancing feature interaction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) It proposes a query unit design that incorporates the physical location features of anchor neighborhoods. Specifically, a non-neighborhood central anchor is used along with a neighborhood central anchor in each query unit to help the neighborhood central anchor better fit to the target points, improving prediction accuracy.

2) It proposes a grouped local self-attention (GL-SA) mechanism that enhances feature interaction among queries within the same group while efficiently facilitating feature interaction among queries from different groups. This reduces the computational complexity compared to vanilla self-attention. 

3) It validates the proposed methods on the nuScenes dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance for HD map construction, with 63.0 mAP after 24 epochs of training. It also reduces memory consumption by over 8GB compared to a baseline model.

In summary, the main contributions are: anchor neighborhood query design, grouped local self-attention, and superior experimental results on the nuScenes dataset for the task of HD map construction.
