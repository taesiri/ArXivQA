## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes PromptMTopic, a novel prompt-based model for unsupervised multimodal topic modeling of memes. Memes contain text and visual elements that convey meaning, but most topic models focus only on text. PromptMTopic utilizes a visual language model to extract image captions, combines them with meme text, and leverages chatbot capabilities to identify meme topics and group similar topics based on carefully constructed prompts. Evaluations on real-world meme datasets demonstrate PromptMTopic's ability to learn more coherent and descriptive topics compared to state-of-the-art baselines. A qualitative analysis also shows that PromptMTopic can identify culturally relevant meme topics that other models may overlook. The significance of this work lies in advancing multimodal analysis of memes - an increasingly ubiquitous communication medium - by harnessing large language models' natural language understanding. Limitations around potential model hallucinations are discussed. Overall, the proposed prompt-based framework extends the potential of large language models to enhance multimodal topic modeling across various domains.
