# [Predicting Human Translation Difficulty with Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Translating text from one language to another varies in difficulty for human translators. Some words and phrases require more time and effort to process cognitively. 
- Prior work has proposed surprisal and attention features from neural machine translation (NMT) models as potential predictors of this translation difficulty, but evaluations have been limited.

Proposed Solution:
- Use reading times and production durations from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database as measures of translation difficulty. Data covers 312 translators working on 13 language pairs. 
- Evaluate surprisal from a multilingual language model and an NMT model as predictors of human translation difficulty. Also extract 3 types of attention features from the NMT model - encoder, decoder, and cross-attention.
- Compare predictive performance of surprisal and attention features using log-likelihood tests. Also analyze the relationships through regression coefficients.

Main Contributions:
- Surprisal is found to be the best single predictor of human translation duration. Translation surprisal outperforms monolingual surprisal.
- Attention features provide supplementary predictive power when combined with surprisal measures. 
- Analysis of coefficients shows interpretable relationships between attention features and translation difficulty.
- Comprehensive investigation of predicting human translation difficulty using state-of-the-art NLP models and the largest dataset of translators to date.

In summary, the paper demonstrates surprisal's efficacy in predicting translation difficulty across languages. The analysis also provides novel findings into how attention patterns captured by NMT relate to processing challenges faced by human translators.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates surprisal and attention features from a neural machine translation model as predictors of human translation difficulty, measured by reading times and production duration, using data from hundreds of translators working across 13 language pairs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several contributions to research on predicting human translation difficulty:

1) It provides a comprehensive evaluation of surprisal (both monolingual and translation surprisal) as a predictor of human translation difficulty, operationalized as source reading time, target reading time, and translation production duration. The analyses draw on data from hundreds of translators working across 13 language pairs, making it the most extensive investigation to date.

2) It proposes several attention-based features derived from a neural machine translation model and evaluates their ability to predict translation difficulty. While less consistent than surprisal, these attentional features provide supplementary predictive power when combined with surprisal. 

3) Through analyses of predictor coefficients and breakdowns by parts-of-speech, the paper offers insights into the aspects of translation difficulty captured by surprisal and attention. For example, open-class words tend to be more difficult than function words, and increases in both monolingual and translation surprisal are indicative of greater processing effort.

4) The use of state-of-the-art language models and neural machine translation models to estimate surprisal and extract attentional features demonstrates the promise of modern NLP models for research on human translation. The alignment between model predictions and human processing times supports accounts of surprisal as a measure of cognitive effort and provides quantitative evidence for trade-offs between translation fidelity and fluency.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of surprisal and attention for predicting human translation difficulty, providing new evidence that modern NLP models can shed light on translation as a cognitive process.

The paper investigates using surprisal and attentional features from an NMT model to predict human translation difficulty, as measured by reading times and production duration. It draws on behavioral data from the CRITT TPR-DB across 13 language pairs and hundreds of human translators. The key findings are that surprisal is a strong predictor, especially translation surprisal for target difficulty, while attention provides supplementary predictive power.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper proposes using surprisal and attentional features from neural machine translation models to predict human translation difficulty. What are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of using NMT models for this purpose compared to other types of language models?

2. The paper evaluates both monolingual surprisal and translation surprisal. What is the key difference between these two types of surprisal and why might translation surprisal be a better predictor of certain measures like target reading time? 

3. The paper extracts several attentional features from the encoder, decoder, and cross attention modules in the NMT model. Why might these different attention modules provide complementary signals about translation difficulty? How could you design additional attentional features to better capture translation difficulty?

4. The analysis shows that surprisal is the single best predictor while attentional features provide supplementary predictive power. Why do you think this is the case? What improvements could be made to the attentional features to make them stronger standalone predictors?  

5. The paper normalizes the surprisal and attentional features by segment length. Why is this an important step and how does it impact the results? Are there other normalization techniques you would recommend exploring?

6. The analysis discovers some contrasts between open class and closed class words in terms of predictability and translation difficulty. What might explain these differences? How would you design an analysis to further analyze this?

7. The paper combines data from 13 different language pairs. Do you expect the results would differ substantially if analyzing a single language pair? How would you determine if predictors generalize across language pairs?  

8. The linear mixed effects models include random intercepts for language pair and participant ID. What is the motivation behind these modeling choices? Would you recommend any adjustments to the model specification?

9. Log-likelihood delta is used to quantify predictive performance. What are the advantages of this metric compared to using model R-squared for example? Are there any limitations?

10. The analysis focuses on predicting reading times and production duration. What other behavioral measures of translation difficulty would be useful to predict and why? How might the choice of difficulty measure impact conclusions?
