# [Time to Cite: Modeling Citation Networks using the Dynamic Impact   Single-Event Embedding Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Citation networks are an important type of network for studying the science of science (SciSci). They allow analyzing the impact and dynamics of scientific publications over time.
- However, existing models for dynamic networks assume multiple events can occur between node pairs over time. This does not apply to citation networks where there is only a single event (the citation) between a citing-cited paper pair. 
- Hence, there is a need for models tailored to such "Single-Event Networks" (SENs) that can characterize both the dynamic impact of papers and embed the network structure.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding (\textsc{DISEE}) model to address this gap.

- It introduces the "Single-Event Poisson Process" (SE-PP), a variant of the Poisson process likelihood designed for SENs.

- The SE-PP is combined with a Latent Distance Model (LDM) that embeds nodes in a latent space. The distance in this space determines the link probability.

- Each cited paper is modeled to have a time-varying impact function based on parametric distributions like log-normal. This controls the mass/activity level of that node over time.

- Together, the LDM and impact functions allow \textsc{DISEE} to model both structure and temporal dynamics.

Main Contributions:

1) Deriving the novel Single-Event Poisson Process (SE-PP) likelihood for SENs.

2) Proposing the \textsc{DISEE} model integrating SE-PP with LDM and dynamic impact modeling.

3) Demonstrating on real citation networks that \textsc{DISEE} reconciles network embedding and temporal impact assessment, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art static LDMs while providing interpretable dynamic impact functions for nodes.

In summary, the paper addresses the problem of modeling citation networks by designing a tailored approach for Single-Event Networks. The resulting \textsc{DISEE} model combines representation learning with characterization of temporal dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new model called DISEE that reconciles traditional approaches for quantifying the impact of scientific papers over time with methods that embed citation networks in low-dimensional latent spaces to predict links.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding (\textsc{DISEE}) model for modeling citation networks. Specifically:

1) The paper derives the single-event Poisson process (SE-PP) to model networks where each node pair has at most one link (single-event networks). 

2) It proposes the \textsc{DISEE} model that combines the SE-PP with a latent distance model to jointly model the citation impact dynamics and embedding structure of citation networks.

3) It shows that \textsc{DISEE} reconciles conventional citation impact modeling with latent distance network embedding, inheriting the link prediction performance of powerful static methods like the Latent Distance Model while also enabling characterization of citation impact dynamics.

In summary, the key contribution is the \textsc{DISEE} model that jointly models the temporal citation impact and embedding structure of citation networks, demonstrating how classical dynamic impact assessments can be reconciled with modern network representation learning methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Single-event networks (SENs): Networks where links between nodes occur only once, such as in citation networks where one paper cites another only once. 

- Single-event Poisson process (SE-PP): A modified Poisson process likelihood designed to model single-event networks, derived in this paper.

- Dynamic impact modeling: Modeling and quantifying the temporal dynamics of a node's impact in the network, such as a paper's citation dynamics over time.

- Latent distance modeling (LDM): Embedding network nodes in a low-dimensional latent space where distance reflects linkage probability.

- Reconciliation: Combining dynamic impact modeling with latent distance modeling, as done in the proposed DISEE model.  

- Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding (DISEE) model: The main model contribution - embeds nodes based on LDM while modeling impact dynamics.

- Log-normal distribution: Used to model temporal dynamics of impact for nodes.

- Link prediction: Evaluating model capacity to predict missing or future links.

So in summary, key concepts relate to single-event network modeling, latent representations, dynamic impact quantification, and combining these approaches in the DISEE model.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding (\textsc{DISEE}) model. What is the key innovation of this model compared to prior dynamic network embedding and impact characterization approaches?

2. The paper introduces the concept of a Single-Event Network (SEN). How does an SEN differ from a standard dynamic network? What likelihood function does the paper derive specifically for SENs?

3. Explain the generative process used to create synthetic SENs. What are some limitations of this generative process and how could it be improved? 

4. The \textsc{DISEE} model combines an impact function with a latent distance model. Explain how these two components are combined mathematically in the model. What flexibility does this allow?

5. What specific impact functions does the paper experiment with (\textsc{Log-Normal}, \textsc{Truncated Normal}, etc.)? How do these capture different citation dynamics? How are they incorporated into the preference attachment framework?

6. Walk through the experimental setup, baselines, and evaluation metrics used. What were the key findings? How does \textsc{DISEE} compare to temporal preferential attachment and static latent distance models?

7. Analyze the link prediction performance of \textsc{DISEE} as embedding dimensionality increases in Table 1. Is there a trend and how do you explain it based on the model dynamics?

8. How does the paper assess the quality of the learned impact functions? Provide examples from Figure 4. When does the inferred impact distribution match or deviate from the true distribution?

9. Explain the embedding visualizations provided in Figures 5 and 6. How do these depict paper lifecycles and the evolution of research fields over time? What new insights do they provide compared to static embeddings?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on citation networks. What other types of single-event networks could this model be applied to? What modifications or extensions would be needed?
