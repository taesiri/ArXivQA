# [Time to Cite: Modeling Citation Networks using the Dynamic Impact   Single-Event Embedding Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Citation networks are an important type of network for studying the science of science (SciSci). They allow analyzing the impact and dynamics of scientific publications over time.
- However, existing models for dynamic networks assume multiple events can occur between node pairs over time. This does not apply to citation networks where there is only a single event (the citation) between a citing-cited paper pair. 
- Hence, there is a need for models tailored to such "Single-Event Networks" (SENs) that can characterize both the dynamic impact of papers and embed the network structure.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding (\textsc{DISEE}) model to address this gap.

- It introduces the "Single-Event Poisson Process" (SE-PP), a variant of the Poisson process likelihood designed for SENs.

- The SE-PP is combined with a Latent Distance Model (LDM) that embeds nodes in a latent space. The distance in this space determines the link probability.

- Each cited paper is modeled to have a time-varying impact function based on parametric distributions like log-normal. This controls the mass/activity level of that node over time.

- Together, the LDM and impact functions allow \textsc{DISEE} to model both structure and temporal dynamics.

Main Contributions:

1) Deriving the novel Single-Event Poisson Process (SE-PP) likelihood for SENs.

2) Proposing the \textsc{DISEE} model integrating SE-PP with LDM and dynamic impact modeling.

3) Demonstrating on real citation networks that \textsc{DISEE} reconciles network embedding and temporal impact assessment, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art static LDMs while providing interpretable dynamic impact functions for nodes.

In summary, the paper addresses the problem of modeling citation networks by designing a tailored approach for Single-Event Networks. The resulting \textsc{DISEE} model combines representation learning with characterization of temporal dynamics.
