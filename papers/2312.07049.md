# [Improving Factual Error Correction by Learning to Inject Factual Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07049)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes LIFE, a novel distantly supervised approach for factual error correction (FEC). LIFE circumvents the bottleneck faced by previous FEC methods which rely on explicitly identifying factual errors before correcting them. It follows a three-step `mask-corrupt-correct' strategy. First, a corruptor model is trained using the `mask-then-corrupt' procedure to deliberately introduce factual errors into correct text. The trained corruptor is then applied to generate synthetic paired data of false and correct claims. After filtering low-quality data, the remaining data is utilized to train an end-to-end corrector model without needing an error identification stage. Experiments conducted on the FECDATA dataset demonstrate that LIFE substantially outperforms previous distantly supervised baselines and even few-shot language models, achieving new state-of-the-art results. For instance, it surpasses the best performing counterpart method by 10.59 points in SARI Final score. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the efficacy of LIFE in boosting FEC performance. Overall, this work makes notable contributions through its innovative corruption-based data augmentation strategy and associated corrector model.
