# [Basque and Spanish Counter Narrative Generation: Data Creation and   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hate speech (HS) is increasingly prevalent online and can spread easily. Counter narratives (CNs) have been proposed as an effective approach to mitigate the spread of HS by providing non-aggressive, fact-based responses. 
- Prior work on automatic CN generation has focused predominantly on English due to lack of non-English training data and models. There is a need for multilingual CN data and models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents CONAN-EUS, a new parallel Basque and Spanish CN dataset. It is created by machine translating and manually post-editing the English CONAN dataset into Basque and Spanish.
- Experiments are conducted using the multilingual mT5 model in monolingual, multilingual and cross-lingual settings to study the impact of different training strategies.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of CONAN-EUS - the first Basque CN dataset and a parallel Basque/Spanish/English CN corpus to facilitate multilingual CN research.
- Empirical analysis showing CN generation benefits from training on post-edited data rather than raw MT output.
- Findings on multilingual training being beneficial for English/Spanish but not Basque, indicating asymmetry in multilinguality of models. 
- Analysis of data-transfer vs model-transfer for CN generation in multiple languages, with differences observed between Spanish and Basque.
- The work opens up future research directions in multilingual/cross-lingual CN generation and transferring to low-resource languages.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in creation of multilingual CN data and analysis to advance the under-explored area of non-English automatic CN generation.
