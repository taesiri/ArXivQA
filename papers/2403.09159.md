# [Basque and Spanish Counter Narrative Generation: Data Creation and   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hate speech (HS) is increasingly prevalent online and can spread easily. Counter narratives (CNs) have been proposed as an effective approach to mitigate the spread of HS by providing non-aggressive, fact-based responses. 
- Prior work on automatic CN generation has focused predominantly on English due to lack of non-English training data and models. There is a need for multilingual CN data and models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents CONAN-EUS, a new parallel Basque and Spanish CN dataset. It is created by machine translating and manually post-editing the English CONAN dataset into Basque and Spanish.
- Experiments are conducted using the multilingual mT5 model in monolingual, multilingual and cross-lingual settings to study the impact of different training strategies.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of CONAN-EUS - the first Basque CN dataset and a parallel Basque/Spanish/English CN corpus to facilitate multilingual CN research.
- Empirical analysis showing CN generation benefits from training on post-edited data rather than raw MT output.
- Findings on multilingual training being beneficial for English/Spanish but not Basque, indicating asymmetry in multilinguality of models. 
- Analysis of data-transfer vs model-transfer for CN generation in multiple languages, with differences observed between Spanish and Basque.
- The work opens up future research directions in multilingual/cross-lingual CN generation and transferring to low-resource languages.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in creation of multilingual CN data and analysis to advance the under-explored area of non-English automatic CN generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents CONAN-EUS, a new parallel Basque and Spanish dataset for counter narrative generation, and experiments with multilingual encoder-decoder models to study the impact of machine translation, post-editing, and cross-lingual transfer on generating high-quality counter narratives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation of CONAN-EUS, a new parallel Basque and Spanish dataset for counter narrative generation. The dataset consists of 6,654 machine translated hate speech-counter narrative pairs and 6,654 gold standard human-curated pairs in each language, parallel to the original English CONAN dataset. This allows for novel research into multilingual and crosslingual automatic generation of counter narratives. The paper also presents experiments with the mT5 model showing that counter narrative generation benefits greatly from training on post-edited data compared to relying solely on silver machine translation data. Additionally, the results provide interesting insights into multilinguality asymmetries of generative models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Counter Narratives
- Hate Speech
- Multilinguality 
- Text Generation
- Machine Translation
- Data Transfer
- Model Transfer
- Crosslingual Transfer
- Encoder-Decoder Models
- Basque
- Spanish

The paper presents a new parallel Basque and Spanish dataset for counter narrative generation called CONAN-EUS. It focuses on studying counter narrative generation from a multilingual and crosslingual perspective using this new dataset. Key aspects examined include data transfer approaches, model transfer approaches, and the performance of multilingual encoder-decoder models like mT5. The languages focused on are English, Spanish, and Basque. So terms like "counter narratives", "hate speech", "multilinguality", "crosslingual transfer", "Basque", and "Spanish" are central to the paper. The ultimate goal is improving techniques for automatic counter narrative generation and mitigating lacks of training data across languages.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new parallel corpus called CONAN-EUS for Basque and Spanish counter narrative generation. What were the steps taken to build this corpus and why was it necessary?

2. The paper experiments with machine translation plus post-editing to create the Basque and Spanish portions of CONAN-EUS. What were some of the common machine translation errors found during the post-editing process for each language?

3. The paper compares multiple approaches for counter narrative generation, including monolingual training, multilingual training, and zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. Can you summarize the key findings from the experiments with mT5 for each of these settings? 

4. For the zero-shot cross-lingual experiments, why does model transfer work better than data transfer for Spanish but not for Basque? What explanations are provided in the paper?

5. Both automatic and manual evaluations were conducted in the paper. Did the automatic metrics like BLEU correlate well with the human judgments? What were some discrepancies found between the two types of evaluations?

6. In the error analysis, the paper shows some examples of generated counter narratives that lack relatedness and specificity despite being coherent and grammatical. Why do you think this occurs and how can it be improved?  

7. The paper argues that currently available automatic metrics may not adequately measure performance for counter narrative generation. What alternative evaluation metrics or protocols could be proposed to better capture key attributes like relatedness and specificity?

8. How much value do you think the parallel Basque/Spanish/English corpus introduced in this paper could provide for future research directions related to multilingual and cross-lingual counter narrative generation?

9. Could the data creation, training, and evaluation methodology explored in this paper be applied to other language pairs beyond English/Basque/Spanish? What challenges or opportunities might arise?

10. The authors note that collecting expert counter narrative training data is costly and time consuming. Do you have any ideas for lower resource approaches to obtain labeled CN data or improve performance without large manually annotated datasets?
