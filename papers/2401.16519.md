# [Extending the kinematic theory of rapid movements with new primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model has been used to describe 2D spatiotemporal trajectories, representing them as temporally overlapped arcs traversed at lognormal velocity between virtual target points. 
- However, arcs linking virtual points have limitations reconstructing complex trajectories, and lognormals may not perfectly fit the velocity profile.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes the Kinematic Theory Transform (KTT), a mathematical framework to incorporate new primitives for both the trajectory and velocity profile.
- For trajectory, clothoids are introduced which can capture inflection points between virtual points. 
- For velocity profile, Gaussian, Gamma, Beta, Double-bounded lognormal and Generalized Extreme Value functions are implemented as alternatives to lognormal.

Main Contributions:
- Definition of a mathematical transform to enable use of alternative trajectories and velocity functions while maintaining parameter interpretability.
- Introduction of Euler clothoids to link virtual target points, better capturing complex trajectories.  
- Implementation and evaluation of several bell-shaped velocity functions for more accurate profile fitting.
- Testing on a range of human, animal and robot movement datasets demonstrates improved reconstruction accuracy over existing methods.
- Integrated into extended version of iDeLog software and made available for future spatiotemporal sequence analysis.

In summary, the paper generalizes the Kinematic Theory to better model complex biological movements by enabling trajectory and velocity profile representations beyond traditional primitives. Experiments confirm improved reconstruction capabilities on diverse datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Kinematic Theory Transform framework that generalizes the kinematic theory of rapid movements by allowing different trajectory curves and bell-shaped velocity functions to model complex biological motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of the Kinematic Theory Transform (KTT), which generalizes the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Movements to allow the use of different curves and bell-shaped functions to model the trajectory and velocity profile of rapid movements. Specifically, the paper:

1) Defines a mathematical framework that allows using parametric curves other than circular arcs to link the virtual target points that characterize the trajectory. As an example, it shows how clothoid curves can be integrated.

2) Allows using bell-shaped functions other than the lognormal to model the velocity profile, including Gaussian, Gamma, Beta, Double-bounded lognormal and Generalized Extreme Value functions. 

3) Evaluates the use of these different primitives on real data of human, animal and robot movements, showing improved reconstruction performance over existing methods. 

4) Discusses the biological interpretation and meaning of the parameters of these new primitives.

In summary, the KTT provides a more flexible mathematical transform to analyze a wide range of spatiotemporal sequences with bell-shaped velocity profiles, generalizing and expanding the applicability of the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Movements.
