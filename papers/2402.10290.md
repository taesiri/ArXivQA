# [Experiments with Encoding Structured Data for Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sequential decision making domains like Battlespace are important testbeds for planning problems and wargaming. 
- Battlespace is introduced by the DoD as a platform for wargaming exercises with features like partial observability, multi-player modes, complex terrain, etc.
- Key challenges in Battlespace are action/state space sparsity, large input space to represent game state, and multi-agent collaboration.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop agents that combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to navigate the Battlespace environment.
- Explore different encoding techniques to convert the structured data representing game state into tensors that can be input to a neural network.
- Use MCTS with random rollouts to generate training signals for the neural network.
- Experiment with convolutional and dense neural networks with tricks like uncorrelated data sampling to stabilize training.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis of different encoding strategies to represent complex game state as tensors, showing how concatenation order impacts learning.
- Experiments with various neural network architectures like CNNs and Dense NNs to learn game dynamics.
- Using MCTS rollouts to generate training signals for the neural network to estimate action scores.  
- Evaluation of agent performance in simplified Battlespace environments, highlighting action space complexity and biases towards safer strategies.
- Discussion comparing encoding representations and how the number of layers scales with properties.
- Identified challenges and future work like game-theoretic approaches to address action space complexity.

In summary, the paper explores techniques to apply deep reinforcement learning in the complex Battlespace domain by encoding state representations and using MCTS for generating training signals. Key insights on encoding approaches and neural network architectures are presented along with analysis of agent biases.
