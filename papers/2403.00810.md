# [Bootstrapping Cognitive Agents with a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00810)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 contain a lot of noisy, general knowledge about the world, but it is difficult to fine-tune or update them. On the other hand, cognitive architectures are highly interpretable and flexible to update, but require extensive manual effort to instantiate the initial knowledge. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a framework to combine the strengths of LLMs and cognitive architectures. The key idea is to bootstrap a cognitive agent with the noisy knowledge encoded in LLMs to generate the initial set of production rules. Then, use the reasoning and learning capabilities of the cognitive architecture to identify and filter out noise, and convert the knowledge into actionable rules for controlling an embodied agent.

The framework has 4 main components:
1) World knowledge base initialized from an LLM through prompts
2) Environment knowledge reflecting agent's observations 
3) Procedural memory as production rules generated from the LLM
4) Task stack to keep track of attending goals

The bootstrapping process works by giving the agent a curriculum of task families, querying the LLM to get actions and production rules for unfamiliar states, and updating rules through a utility mechanism.

Main Contributions:
1) A novel framework to combine strengths of LLMs and cognitive architectures - LLM provides general knowledge, cognitive architecture grounds it to embodied agents
2) Demonstration of the framework bootstrapping an agent efficiently on kitchen tasks involving tool use and task decomposition 
3) Analysis showing significantly fewer tokens needed at test time compared to query-based LLM agents, enabling cost-effective transfer to new environments

Overall, the key insight is to separate general knowledge generation and specific knowledge application between LLM and cognitive architecture. The modularity enables interpretability, one-shot updates, and generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework that combines large language models and cognitive architectures to bootstrap an embodied agent for performing kitchen tasks, leveraging the world knowledge encoded in LLMs while overcoming their limitations through the reasoning and learning capabilities of cognitive architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is threefold:

1) Proposing an agent framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with a customized cognitive architecture. Specifically, using the LLMs as a knowledge source to generate production rules for the cognitive architecture.

2) Demonstrating how this framework can learn to perform various kitchen tasks from bootstrapping, without extensive human input or supervision. The tasks include finding objects, slicing, and clearing countertops.

3) Showing that when applied to new environments, the proposed framework requires significantly fewer tokens/queries to the LLM compared to simply using the LLM to suggest actions. This makes the approach more efficient and cost-effective.

In summary, the key contribution is a framework for bootstrapping a cognitive agent by extracting and filtering the noisy knowledge in LLMs, with minimal human effort. The experiments show this leads to an efficient agent that can generalize well to new situations and environments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper discusses using large pretrained language models like GPT-4 as a source of world knowledge to bootstrap a cognitive agent.

- Cognitive architectures: The paper proposes combining LLMs with cognitive architectures that have procedural and declarative memories to create an agent framework.

- Production rules: The procedural memory in cognitive architectures consists of production rules that dictate the agent's behavior. The paper discusses generating these rules from LLMs. 

- Bootstrapping: The process of using the knowledge in LLMs to automatically generate an initial set of production rules and world knowledge to seed the cognitive agent.

- Generalization: A key benefit of the framework is that the production rules learn general strategies that can transfer to new objects and environments, unlike LLM-generated plans for specific instances.

- Efficiency: Experiments show the bootstrapped agent requires many fewer tokens to deploy to new environments compared to querying the LLM for actions each time.

- Interpretability: The production rules provide more transparency and interpretability compared to end-to-end learned policies.

So in summary, the key terms cover large language models, cognitive architectures, production rules, bootstrapping, generalization, efficiency, and interpretability in the context of combining neural and symbolic AI.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes combining large language models (LLMs) with cognitive architectures. What are the main benefits and limitations of using LLMs versus cognitive architectures on their own? How does combining them help mitigate those limitations?

2. The paper generates production rules from natural language descriptions provided by the LLM. What are some challenges in converting from natural language to executable production rules? How does the two-step process (English description then code generation) help address those? 

3. The bootstrapping process requires a curriculum of task families as input. What considerations should go into designing an effective curriculum for bootstrapping? How might the curriculum design impact the kinds of skills learned?

4. The paper uses a critic LLM to provide suggestions to improve existing production rules. What are some common issues it tries to resolve (over-constraining, over-generalization etc.)? How does the critic identify those issues to provide meaningful feedback?

5. Utility propagation is used to reinforce production rules leading to task completion. How does this mechanism help handle noise and inconsistencies in the LLM's knowledge? Does it create any incentive issues?

6. The knowledge base starts empty and grows as the agent encounters unknown facts. How does querying the LLM to populate the knowledge base help with transfer to new objects and environments? What are limitations of this approach?

7. The paper claims the framework is more efficient than querying the LLM repeatedly. What specific mechanisms contribute to the improved efficiency? How was this claim validated quantitatively?

8. The production rules learned are represented as decision trees. What are the advantages of having executable decision trees versus neural network policies or symbolic plans?

9. What are some key differences in how the bootstrapped agent approaches tasks compared to the LLM action-only agent? What accounts for those differences in strategy/style? 

10. The framework is evaluated in a simulated environment. What key challenges do you foresee in transferring this approach to real-world robotic systems?
