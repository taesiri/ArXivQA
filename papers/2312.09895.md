# [Generative Context-aware Fine-tuning of Self-supervised Speech Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning speech models is typically done at the utterance level without using context from previous utterances, limiting performance on tasks like speech recognition and spoken language understanding.  
- Prior works have used preceding audio or text history as context, but rely on access to previous utterances at inference time and often require large additional context modules.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a "generative context-aware fine-tuning" approach that generates useful context information from preceding text using a large language model (LLM).  
- Explore different prompts to generate contextual text from the LLM based on predicting next sentence, question, topic and title.
- Extract context embedding from generated text using BERT encoder. 
- Distill this external context module into a simple pooling + FC layer during fine-tuning that doesn't require the LLM or context at inference.

Main Contributions:
- Study of different ways to generate contextual text from an LLM to provide useful context.
- Proposal of a distillation method to remove the need for external context or LLM at inference after fine-tuning, reducing computation. 
- Evaluations on speech recognition and spoken language understanding tasks showing accuracy improvements over context-free fine-tuning baselines.
- Approach is competitive with oracle context injection methods and outperforms them in low-resource settings.

In summary, the key ideas are using an LLM to generate contextual information to augment speech model fine-tuning, and distilling this into a very compact context module that doesn't require the LLM at inference time. Evaluations demonstrate improved performance across several speech tasks.
