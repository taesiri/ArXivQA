# [Evaluating Large Language Models as Virtual Annotators for Time-series   Physical Sensing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01133)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional human annotation of time-series physical sensing data (e.g. accelerometer data) relies on alternate modalities like video which is expensive, inefficient and prone to biases. 
- Using raw sensor data directly with large language models (LLMs) fails to provide accurate and consistent annotations even when sample examples are provided.

Proposed Solution:
- Encode raw sensor data into embeddings using a self-supervised pre-trained encoder which clusters data from the same class.
- Provide the embeddings as examples to the LLM along with metric-based guidance (e.g. distance function) to add context.
- Annotate new query data by assessing proximity of its embedding to the example embeddings of different classes.

Key Contributions:
- Performed a detailed study to analyze challenges faced by LLM in comprehending raw sensor data (GPT-4 used as case study)
- Proposed an approach to encode raw data using self-supervised encoders like SimCLR and TFC to project them into an embedding space
- Designed prompts with metric guidance and example embeddings to provide better context to LLM
- Evaluated on 4 benchmark datasets - encodings allowed GPT-4 to achieve higher annotation accuracy and consistency compared to raw data
- Analyzed impact of factors like embedding dimensions, number of examples, distance metrics on accuracy and cost
- Showed encodings help LLM provide better reasoning behind annotations
- Discussed key observations and future ideas like active learning to further refine labels

In summary, the paper systematically explores the potential of using self-supervised encodings over raw data to unlock the capability of LLMs as effective virtual annotators for time-series physical sensing data without needing expensive fine-tuning.
