# [What Planning Problems Can A Relational Neural Network Solve?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03682)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the circuit complexity of goal-conditioned policies represented by relational neural networks (RelNNs) such as graph neural networks and Transformers. It draws connections between the regression width of a planning problem and the size and depth required for a RelNN to solve that problem. The authors define the notion of strong optimally-serializable (SOS) width, which characterizes how effectively the subgoals in backward search can be serialized and achieved sequentially. They show constructively that for planning problems with constant SOS width, there exist RelNNs of constant breadth (independent of number of objects) that can solve those problems. Furthermore, they provide algorithms to compile the backward search directly into polynomial-sized RelNN circuits for problems with small SOS widths. The results also explain why certain difficult planning problems like Sokoban require RelNNs with unbounded breadth. Overall, this theoretical characterization highlights the relationship between the structure of planning problems and the complexity of neural networks required to represent policies, providing insights into generalizability.
