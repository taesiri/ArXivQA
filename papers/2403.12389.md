# [Learning-guided iterated local search for the minmax multiple traveling   salesman problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12389)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the minmax multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP). This involves dividing a set of cities among multiple salesmen so that each city is visited exactly once and the maximum tour length among all salesmen is minimized. Solving this problem is computationally challenging. Prior state-of-the-art algorithms still achieve unsatisfactory performance on very challenging benchmark instances.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new iterative metaheuristic algorithm called Multi-Armed Bandit guided Iterated Local Search (MILS). The key ideas are:

- Use an aggressive best-improvement local search with multiple neighborhoods to find high-quality local optima.  

- Employ a probabilistic acceptance criterion to continuously diversify the search and escape deep local optima traps.

- Intelligently select removal and insertion operators for perturbing solutions using a Multi-Armed Bandit learning technique. This allows escaping from poor local optima.

- Enhance elite solutions further by optimizing each tour using an effective TSP heuristic (EAX-TSP).

- Periodically rebuild a new initial solution to explore new areas of the search space.

Main Contributions:

- The proposed MILS algorithm sets 32 new best known results on challenging benchmark instances that could not be improved before. It also matches 35 previous best known results.

- Experiments demonstrate the algorithm is particularly effective for instances with a small number of tours. It significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods.

- The benefit of using best-improvement local search and a Multi-Armed Bandit technique is analyzed through ablation studies. Results show these are critical components.

- The algorithm exhibits excellent long-term convergence behavior. Given more runtime, it can further improve solutions on difficult instances.

In summary, the paper makes a valuable contribution by advancing the state-of-the-art in solving the minmax mTSP problem. The MILS algorithm and analyses provide useful insights. There is potential to apply similar techniques to other routing problems.
