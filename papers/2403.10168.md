# [Explainability through uncertainty: Trustworthy decision-making with   neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Standard neural networks (NNs) tend to be overconfident, meaning they predict incorrect labels with high confidence. This is especially problematic under distribution shifts when the data distribution changes over time.
- Uncertainty estimation methods have been developed to capture model uncertainty and mitigate overconfidence, but have not been explicitly linked to explainable AI (XAI). 
- Moreover, existing literature does not consider the actionability of uncertainty estimates for decision support systems and lacks real-world case studies with distribution shifts.

Proposed Solution:
- A general uncertainty framework with two components:
   1) Uncertainty estimation positioned as an XAI technique, quantified using information-theoretic measures. Argumented to increase model trust, actionability and robustness.
   2) Classification with rejection to bring a human expert in the loop for uncertain observations, reducing misclassifications.
- Case study applying the framework to NNs for student performance prediction, a task prone to distribution shifts when deploying the model over time. 

Main Contributions:
1) Positioning uncertainty estimation as an XAI method, giving local and model-specific explanations.
2) Using classification with rejection to leverage uncertainty for decision support systems.
3) Case study demonstrating that standard NNs become overconfident under distribution shifts. In contrast, NNs with uncertainty as XAI properly communicate novelty and enable accuracy improvements through rejection.

In summary, the paper proposes uncertainty estimation as an XAI technique to increase trust, actionability and robustness of neural networks for decision support systems facing distribution shifts. The value is demonstrated on a student performance prediction case study.
