# [CUDA: Convolution-based Unlearnable Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04278)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: Can we generate unlearnable datasets that are robust to adversarial training by using controlled class-wise convolutions instead of additive noises?The key points are:- Existing methods for generating unlearnable datasets use small additive noises, making them vulnerable to adversarial training which is designed to be robust against such noises. - This paper proposes a new method called Convolution-based Unlearnable Dataset (CUDA) that instead uses controlled class-wise convolutions to generate the unlearnable data.- The convolutions are performed using randomly generated filters per class based on a private key. This encourages models to learn the relation between filters and labels rather than useful features.- CUDA is designed to be robust against adversarial training since it introduces multiplicative noise in the Fourier domain rather than small additive noises.- Experiments show CUDA is effective across datasets and architectures, and robust to various training techniques like adversarial training, augmentations, regularization etc.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using class-wise controlled convolutions can generate unlearnable datasets that are more robust compared to prior additive noise-based techniques. The effectiveness of CUDA is demonstrated empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) for generating unlearnable datasets that are robust against adversarial training. Specifically:- They propose CUDA, a novel technique to generate unlearnable datasets by performing controlled class-wise convolutions on the training data using randomly generated filters based on a private key. - They show theoretically that CUDA can successfully poison Gaussian mixture data by reducing the accuracy of the optimal Bayes classifier on clean data.- They demonstrate empirically that models trained on CUDA exhibit poor generalization on clean test data under various training settings like empirical risk minimization, adversarial training, randomized smoothing, transfer learning etc. CUDA is also robust to adaptive defenses designed specifically to break it.- Compared to prior unlearnability techniques like error-minimizing noise, targeted adversarial poisoning etc., CUDA generation is much faster as it does not require iterative optimization. It is also more robust to adversarial training and data augmentations.- Overall, CUDA provides an efficient and robust way to generate unlearnable datasets that prevent unauthorized usage of data for training deep learning models. The multiplicative noise added by CUDA in Fourier domain makes it resilient to adversarial training with small additive noise budgets.In summary, the main contribution is proposing CUDA as a novel unlearnability technique and demonstrating its effectiveness theoretically and empirically.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new method called Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) to generate poisoned datasets that make deep learning models fail to learn useful features, instead just memorizing spurious correlations between random convolutional filters and labels; this allows protecting private data from unauthorized use.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on generating unlearnable datasets:- This paper proposes CUDA, a new technique for generating unlearnable datasets that involves convolving images with class-specific filters. Other recent works like EM, TAP, NTGA, and REM rely on adding small additive noises to images. So CUDA offers a different approach based on convolutions rather than additive perturbations. - A key contribution claimed is that CUDA is more robust to adversarial training defenses compared to prior additive noise techniques like EM, TAP, and NTGA. The experiments generally support this claim, showing CUDA performs better under adversarial training than those methods. Though it seems comparable to REM, which is also designed to be robust to adversarial training.- The authors argue CUDA has advantages in terms of computational efficiency since it does not require optimizing perturbations for each image. The timings provided do show CUDA generation is much faster than optimization-based methods like REM. This could make it more practical to generate large unlearnable datasets.- There is some theoretical analysis relating CUDA to degrading the accuracy of Bayes optimal classifiers on Gaussian mixture data. This helps provide some formal justification for the CUDA approach, whereas most prior works are empirical. - The paper explores CUDA effectiveness over multiple datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet), network architectures (ResNet, VGG, etc), and training techniques (ERM, AT, smoothing, etc). This helps demonstrate the general applicability of the method.- Some limitations are that CUDA relies on keeping the convolution filters private, and does not work as well when only a subset of the training data is perturbed. There is also no experimentation on more complex data like audio or video.Overall CUDA offers a new convolution-based approach to generating unlearnable datasets that seems to complement prior additive noise techniques. The efficiency and robustness properties seem promising, though further work is likely needed to handle partial dataset poisoning and more complex datatypes.
