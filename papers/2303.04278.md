# [CUDA: Convolution-based Unlearnable Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04278)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: 

Can we generate unlearnable datasets that are robust to adversarial training by using controlled class-wise convolutions instead of additive noises?

The key points are:

- Existing methods for generating unlearnable datasets use small additive noises, making them vulnerable to adversarial training which is designed to be robust against such noises. 

- This paper proposes a new method called Convolution-based Unlearnable Dataset (CUDA) that instead uses controlled class-wise convolutions to generate the unlearnable data.

- The convolutions are performed using randomly generated filters per class based on a private key. This encourages models to learn the relation between filters and labels rather than useful features.

- CUDA is designed to be robust against adversarial training since it introduces multiplicative noise in the Fourier domain rather than small additive noises.

- Experiments show CUDA is effective across datasets and architectures, and robust to various training techniques like adversarial training, augmentations, regularization etc.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that using class-wise controlled convolutions can generate unlearnable datasets that are more robust compared to prior additive noise-based techniques. The effectiveness of CUDA is demonstrated empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) for generating unlearnable datasets that are robust against adversarial training. Specifically:

- They propose CUDA, a novel technique to generate unlearnable datasets by performing controlled class-wise convolutions on the training data using randomly generated filters based on a private key. 

- They show theoretically that CUDA can successfully poison Gaussian mixture data by reducing the accuracy of the optimal Bayes classifier on clean data.

- They demonstrate empirically that models trained on CUDA exhibit poor generalization on clean test data under various training settings like empirical risk minimization, adversarial training, randomized smoothing, transfer learning etc. CUDA is also robust to adaptive defenses designed specifically to break it.

- Compared to prior unlearnability techniques like error-minimizing noise, targeted adversarial poisoning etc., CUDA generation is much faster as it does not require iterative optimization. It is also more robust to adversarial training and data augmentations.

- Overall, CUDA provides an efficient and robust way to generate unlearnable datasets that prevent unauthorized usage of data for training deep learning models. The multiplicative noise added by CUDA in Fourier domain makes it resilient to adversarial training with small additive noise budgets.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing CUDA as a novel unlearnability technique and demonstrating its effectiveness theoretically and empirically.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) to generate poisoned datasets that make deep learning models fail to learn useful features, instead just memorizing spurious correlations between random convolutional filters and labels; this allows protecting private data from unauthorized use.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on generating unlearnable datasets:

- This paper proposes CUDA, a new technique for generating unlearnable datasets that involves convolving images with class-specific filters. Other recent works like EM, TAP, NTGA, and REM rely on adding small additive noises to images. So CUDA offers a different approach based on convolutions rather than additive perturbations. 

- A key contribution claimed is that CUDA is more robust to adversarial training defenses compared to prior additive noise techniques like EM, TAP, and NTGA. The experiments generally support this claim, showing CUDA performs better under adversarial training than those methods. Though it seems comparable to REM, which is also designed to be robust to adversarial training.

- The authors argue CUDA has advantages in terms of computational efficiency since it does not require optimizing perturbations for each image. The timings provided do show CUDA generation is much faster than optimization-based methods like REM. This could make it more practical to generate large unlearnable datasets.

- There is some theoretical analysis relating CUDA to degrading the accuracy of Bayes optimal classifiers on Gaussian mixture data. This helps provide some formal justification for the CUDA approach, whereas most prior works are empirical. 

- The paper explores CUDA effectiveness over multiple datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet), network architectures (ResNet, VGG, etc), and training techniques (ERM, AT, smoothing, etc). This helps demonstrate the general applicability of the method.

- Some limitations are that CUDA relies on keeping the convolution filters private, and does not work as well when only a subset of the training data is perturbed. There is also no experimentation on more complex data like audio or video.

Overall CUDA offers a new convolution-based approach to generating unlearnable datasets that seems to complement prior additive noise techniques. The efficiency and robustness properties seem promising, though further work is likely needed to handle partial dataset poisoning and more complex datatypes.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending CUDA generation technique to other data modalities like tabular data and text. The authors focus on image data in this work, but mention it could be interesting to apply similar convolution-based poisoning techniques to other data types.

- Improving the robustness of unlearnable data generation techniques like CUDA to adversarial training when only a fraction of the training data is poisoned. The authors show CUDA is effective when poisoning the full training set, but its effectiveness decreases when poisoning only a subset of the data. Developing techniques to maintain effectiveness in partial poisoning scenarios is noted as an area for future work.

- Further theoretical analysis of CUDA considering more complex data distribution assumptions beyond the Gaussian mixture model analyzed in the paper. The authors provide some initial theoretical results on CUDA's effectiveness at poisoning simple Gaussian mixture data, but note more complex theoretical analysis could be interesting future work.

- Studying defenses and adaptive attacks to break techniques like CUDA. The authors design some initial adaptive defenses to test CUDA's robustness, but suggest more work on developing defenses and adaptive attacks in this problem space could be valuable.

- Applications of non-additive noise poisoning techniques like CUDA. The authors note CUDA represents a new class of poisoning attacks based on non-additive noise, which merits additional study as a novel attack technique.

So in summary, the main future directions revolve around extending CUDA to new data types and domains, improving its effectiveness in partial poisoning scenarios, more complex theoretical analysis, developing defenses and attacks, and further study of non-additive poisoning techniques inspired by CUDA. The authors lay out CUDA as an initial algorithm and study, while pointing towards a variety of interesting extensions in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This CVPR 2023 paper proposes a new method called Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) for generating poisoned datasets that are unlearnable for deep learning models. CUDA applies controlled class-wise convolutions using randomly generated filters based on a private key to clean datasets. This encourages models trained on CUDA to learn the correlation between filters and labels rather than useful features for classifying the clean data. The authors show theoretically and empirically that CUDA can successfully degrade the performance of models on the original clean datasets. Experiments demonstrate CUDA's effectiveness against various architectures and datasets under different training techniques like empirical risk minimization, adversarial training, smoothing, transfer learning etc. Compared to prior unlearnability methods, CUDA adds higher noise via convolutions, is computationally efficient as it does not require optimization, and exhibits robustness to techniques designed to break it. Limitations are CUDA may be detectable if clean images are leaked, and performance degrades with mixed clean and poisoned data. Overall, CUDA offers a new class of non-additive noise for data poisoning with strong empirical results, but further theoretical analysis on real datasets would be valuable.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Convolution-based Unlearnable Dataset (CUDA) generation for making datasets unlearnable. Existing techniques add small additive noises to images to achieve unlearnability. However, they are not robust to adversarial training which is designed to handle such small perturbations. To overcome this, CUDA uses controlled class-wise convolutions with random filters generated via a private key to perturb images. This encourages models to learn the shortcut relation between filters and labels rather than useful features. Theoretical analysis shows CUDA can reduce the accuracy of the optimal Bayes classifier for Gaussian mixture data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CUDA against various datasets, architectures, training techniques like ERM, adversarial training, smoothing, etc. For instance, ResNet-18 trained on ImageNet-100 CUDA achieves only 8.96% clean test accuracy with ERM compared to 80.66% with clean data. CUDA is also robust to specifically designed adaptive defenses.

In summary, the key contributions are:
1) Proposing CUDA, a new convolutional perturbation based unlearnability technique. 
2) Theoretical analysis demonstrating the ability of CUDA to reduce clean data accuracy of Bayes optimal classifier.
3) Extensive experiments showing effectiveness of CUDA against various datasets, models, training techniques, and adaptive defenses.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel technique called Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) to generate poisoned datasets that hurt the performance of deep learning models trained on them. The key idea is to use class-wise convolutional filters generated randomly using a private key to blur the training images in a controlled manner. Specifically, the technique generates different random convolutional filters for each class using a blurring parameter. It then performs class-wise convolutions on the training images using the corresponding class filters to obtain the poisoned dataset. This encourages models trained on the poisoned data to learn correlations between the class-wise filters and labels rather than generalizable features useful for clean test data. Since the filters are generated randomly using a private key, the blurring effect cannot be reversed without access to the clean images. The controlled class-wise convolutions introduce multiplicative noise in the frequency domain which makes the technique robust against defenses like adversarial training. Theoretical analysis shows CUDA can reduce the accuracy of Bayes optimal classifier for Gaussian mixture data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness against models trained using techniques like empirical risk minimization, adversarial training, regularization, and transfer learning.
