# [Federated Unlearning: A Survey on Methods, Design Guidelines, and   Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on Federated Unlearning (FU), which refers to selectively removing the contributions of specific clients or data from a federated learning model. 

The paper first introduces key background concepts like machine unlearning and federated learning. It discusses the motivations for FU algorithms, including meeting emerging privacy regulations that give users the right to delete their data, and removing malicious contributions like backdoors from models. 

The paper then formally defines the objectives of FU, which include sample unlearning (removing specific data samples), class unlearning (removing a class of data), and client unlearning (removing a client's entire contribution). It presents experiments showing that even in federated learning, the global model memorizes and retains contributions from client data over many rounds. This motivates the need for explicit unlearning techniques.

The paper analyzes the unique challenges FU introduces compared to centralized machine unlearning, like the decentralized and iterative nature of federated learning. It lays out design requirements and a comprehensive set of metrics to evaluate the efficiency, retained performance, and forgetting ability of FU algorithms.

It then categorizes and reviews recent FU literature based on the unlearning objective and techniques used. Major categories of methods covered include recalibrating historical updates, knowledge distillation, modifying gradients, clustering clients, Bayesian approaches, and more. For each work, the paper summarizes the rationale and design choices.

Finally, the paper synthesizes key lessons learned and open challenges in FU research. It discusses the lack of standardization in datasets and metrics as an issue hindering comparative assessments. It also covers promising future research directions like incentives, feature unlearning, handling multiple simultaneous requests, and integrating privacy-preserving techniques.

In summary, this is a technically comprehensive survey that analyzes FU algorithms for effectiveness, categorizes the state-of-the-art literature, and offers insights to guide future research towards robust and practical FU solutions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the federated unlearning methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes federated unlearning objectives into sample unlearning, class unlearning, and client unlearning. Can you explain the key differences between these objectives? What are some example use cases suited to each one?

2. The paper argues that federated unlearning introduces additional complexity compared to traditional centralized machine unlearning. What are some of the key challenges presented, such as the iterative learning process, non-deterministic training, and inscrutable local datasets? 

3. One of the lessons learned is that the metrics and datasets used to evaluate federated unlearning algorithms often vary between papers. Why does this lack of standardization make comparisons difficult? What could be done to establish more common evaluation practices?   

4. The paper emphasizes the importance of retaining good knowledge acquired from training while selectively eliminating the influence of data to be forgotten. Explain some of the strategies used by algorithms like FedEraser, MoDe, and VeriFi to achieve this balance.  

5. Can you describe the key ideas behind using knowledge distillation and gradient modification techniques for efficient federated unlearning? What are some of the tradeoffs with these approaches?

6. What privacy considerations need to be taken into account when designing federated unlearning solutions? Should the server, target client, or remaining clients perform the unlearning? What are the benefits and drawbacks of each?

7. Explain the high-level approach taken by solutions like Forget-SVGD and BFU that incorporate Bayesian federated learning into their unlearning protocols. How does a Bayesian perspective facilitate data removal?

8. The paper argues that class unlearning can be viewed as a specialized case of client unlearning. Can you elaborate why this is the case? What algorithms like the pruning method of Wang et al. exploit this connection?  

9. What motivates developing specialized solutions for feature unlearning in the context of vertical federated learning? Why might techniques for sample and client unlearning not directly transfer over to the vertical setting?  

10. Beyond efficiency and effectiveness, what other evaluation criteria should be considered for federated unlearning techniques, especially around robustness, adaptability, and practical deployment?
