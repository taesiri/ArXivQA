## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Sliced-Wasserstein Distances and Flows on Cartan-Hadamard Manifolds":

Problem:
The Wasserstein distance is a useful way to compare probability distributions in optimal transport and machine learning. However, it has a high computational cost that scales poorly to large datasets. The sliced-Wasserstein distance is an efficient alternative on Euclidean spaces, but it relies on linear projections and does not extend naturally to distributions on nonlinear manifolds. Comparing distributions on manifolds like hyperbolic spaces or spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices is important for handling hierarchical or covariance data.

Solution:
This paper introduces sliced-Wasserstein distances specially designed for Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, which include hyperbolic spaces and spaces of positive definite matrices. Two versions are proposed: the Geodesic Cartan-Hadamard Sliced-Wasserstein (GCHSW) distance which projects along geodesics, and the Horospherical Cartan-Hadamard Sliced-Wasserstein (HCHSW) distance which projects along horospheres using the Busemann function. These distances integrate one-dimensional Wasserstein distances over projections, providing efficient sliced discrepancies to compare distributions on manifolds.

Contributions:
- Formal generalization of sliced-Wasserstein framework to Cartan-Hadamard manifolds using intrinsic geodesic/horospherical projections
- Instantiation of the distances for specific manifolds like hyperbolic spaces, SPD matrices, and products of manifolds 
- Theoretical analysis showing CHSW distances inherit desirable properties like metrizing weak convergence 
- New sampling procedures by approximating Wasserstein gradient flows of CHSW distances  
- Experiments highlighting benefits over Wasserstein distance for comparing distributions on manifolds

The CHSW distances and flows provide efficient ways to handle probability distributions on nonlinear manifolds important for representing hierarchical or symmetric positive definite data.
