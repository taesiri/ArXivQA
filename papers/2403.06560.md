# [Sliced-Wasserstein Distances and Flows on Cartan-Hadamard Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06560)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Sliced-Wasserstein Distances and Flows on Cartan-Hadamard Manifolds":

Problem:
The Wasserstein distance is a useful way to compare probability distributions in optimal transport and machine learning. However, it has a high computational cost that scales poorly to large datasets. The sliced-Wasserstein distance is an efficient alternative on Euclidean spaces, but it relies on linear projections and does not extend naturally to distributions on nonlinear manifolds. Comparing distributions on manifolds like hyperbolic spaces or spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices is important for handling hierarchical or covariance data.

Solution:
This paper introduces sliced-Wasserstein distances specially designed for Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, which include hyperbolic spaces and spaces of positive definite matrices. Two versions are proposed: the Geodesic Cartan-Hadamard Sliced-Wasserstein (GCHSW) distance which projects along geodesics, and the Horospherical Cartan-Hadamard Sliced-Wasserstein (HCHSW) distance which projects along horospheres using the Busemann function. These distances integrate one-dimensional Wasserstein distances over projections, providing efficient sliced discrepancies to compare distributions on manifolds.

Contributions:
- Formal generalization of sliced-Wasserstein framework to Cartan-Hadamard manifolds using intrinsic geodesic/horospherical projections
- Instantiation of the distances for specific manifolds like hyperbolic spaces, SPD matrices, and products of manifolds 
- Theoretical analysis showing CHSW distances inherit desirable properties like metrizing weak convergence 
- New sampling procedures by approximating Wasserstein gradient flows of CHSW distances  
- Experiments highlighting benefits over Wasserstein distance for comparing distributions on manifolds

The CHSW distances and flows provide efficient ways to handle probability distributions on nonlinear manifolds important for representing hierarchical or symmetric positive definite data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces new Sliced-Wasserstein type discrepancies on Riemannian manifolds of non-positive curvature, including Hyperbolic spaces and the space of symmetric positive definite matrices, analyzes their theoretical properties, and provides applications for comparing probability distributions on these manifolds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces new methods for defining Sliced Wasserstein distances on Riemannian manifolds with non-positive curvature, called Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. The key contributions are:

1) Defining two versions of Cartan-Hadamard Sliced Wasserstein (CHSW) distances, based on geodesic projections and horospherical (Busemann) projections, that generalize the standard Sliced Wasserstein distance to these manifolds. 

2) Specifying the framework and deriving closed-form projections for several important Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, including manifolds with pullback Euclidean metrics, hyperbolic spaces, spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices, and products of such manifolds.

3) Analyzing theoretical properties of the CHSW distances, including establishing conditions for it to be a metric, bounding it by the Wasserstein distance, and showing it metrizes weak convergence on pullback Euclidean manifolds. 

4) Providing applications of CHSW distances for comparing distributions in machine learning settings, including a document classification task with the Mahalanobis distance and comparing datasets viewed as distributions on a product manifold.

5) Deriving Wasserstein gradient flows and nonparametric particle approximation schemes for minimizing the CHSW distances, yielding new sampling algorithms on these manifolds.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a computationally efficient way to compare distributions on a broad class of non-Euclidean manifolds by generalizing sliced optimal transport, along with an analysis of its theoretical properties and demonstration of its usefulness on machine learning applications involving probability distributions on manifolds.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:
