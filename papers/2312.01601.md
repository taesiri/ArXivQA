# [Local-Global History-aware Contrastive Learning for Temporal Knowledge   Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01601)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel temporal knowledge graph reasoning model called LogCL that leverages contrastive learning to better fuse local and global historical information for predicting future facts. LogCL addresses two key challenges: 1) neglecting the importance of historical facts related to the queries when encoding local and global historical patterns, and 2) the weak noise resistance capability of existing methods. To address the first challenge, LogCL introduces an entity-aware attention mechanism to capture query-relevant historical facts in both the local recurrent encoder and global encoder. For the second challenge, LogCL designs a local-global query contrast module based on contrastive learning to improve model robustness. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and robustness of LogCL. The ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component in LogCL. Overall, LogCL provides an effective way to fuse and contrast local and global historical patterns for accurate and robust reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) represent facts that evolve over time and are useful for predicting future facts. However, existing TKG reasoning methods have two key limitations:
1) They do not effectively model the importance of historical facts related to a given query. Each snapshot may contain facts irrelevant to predicting a given query.
2) They exhibit weak robustness to noise in the inputs, leading to degraded performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel model called LogCL that uses contrastive learning to better integrate local and global historical information and enhance robustness.

- LogCL has three key components:
1) Local entity-aware recurrent encoder - Uses an entity-aware attention mechanism to focus on recent snapshots relevant to the query when encoding local historical facts.
2) Global entity-aware encoder - Builds a historical subgraph of facts related to the query and encodes importance historical facts using entity-aware attention. 
3) Local-global query contrast module - Brings local and global representations closer via contrastive learning to improve robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes using entity-aware attention to capture importance of historical facts related to queries, for both local and global modeling.
- Introduces novel local-global contrastive learning approach to integrate local and global patterns and improve model robustness.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on four TKG benchmark datasets. The model is also more robust to noise.

In summary, the key innovation is using contrastive learning to guide integration of global and local patterns and enable filtering of noisy patterns, while using entity-aware attention to focus on snapshots and facts relevant to the query during encoding. This leads to significant gains in accuracy and robustness over prior TKG reasoning techniques.
