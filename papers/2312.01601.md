## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel temporal knowledge graph reasoning model called LogCL that leverages contrastive learning to better fuse local and global historical information for predicting future facts. LogCL addresses two key challenges: 1) neglecting the importance of historical facts related to the queries when encoding local and global historical patterns, and 2) the weak noise resistance capability of existing methods. To address the first challenge, LogCL introduces an entity-aware attention mechanism to capture query-relevant historical facts in both the local recurrent encoder and global encoder. For the second challenge, LogCL designs a local-global query contrast module based on contrastive learning to improve model robustness. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and robustness of LogCL. The ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component in LogCL. Overall, LogCL provides an effective way to fuse and contrast local and global historical patterns for accurate and robust reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs.
