# [Challenging BIG-Bench Tasks and Whether Chain-of-Thought Can Solve Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How effective is chain-of-thought prompting for improving the performance of large language models on challenging reasoning tasks from the BIG-Bench benchmark?

The key hypothesis appears to be that chain-of-thought prompting will enable large language models to substantially improve their performance on tasks from the BIG-Bench benchmark that require multi-step reasoning and inference. 

The authors curate a subset of 23 BIG-Bench tasks into a benchmark called BIG-Bench Hard, where previous models have struggled to match average human rater performance. They hypothesize that chain-of-thought prompting will help models better perform multi-step reasoning on these tasks compared to standard few-shot prompting.

The experiments aim to test whether chain-of-thought prompting improves performance over answer-only prompting on the BIG-Bench Hard tasks. The results provide evidence that chain-of-thought prompting enables models like Codex and PaLM to surpass average human rater performance on over half of the BIG-Bench Hard tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of this prompting approach on challenging reasoning tasks.

In summary, the central research question is whether chain-of-thought prompting can improve language model performance on complex, multi-step reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench that prior models have struggled with. The hypothesis is that chain-of-thought will substantially boost performance on these challenging tasks compared to standard prompting approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Identifying a subset of 23 particularly challenging tasks from BIG-Bench to create a benchmark called BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). The filtering criteria for selecting these tasks are clearly laid out.

- Demonstrating that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting can substantially improve the performance of large language models like Codex and PaLM on the BBH benchmark compared to standard few-shot prompting. CoT prompting allows the models to surpass average human rater performance on over half of the BBH tasks.

- Analyzing the interaction between model scale and CoT prompting. The results show that CoT prompting seems to enable emergent task performance on several BBH tasks that otherwise exhibit flat scaling curves with increasing model size.

- Releasing the curated BBH benchmark, CoT prompts used, and model outputs to facilitate further research on these challenging reasoning tasks.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be carefully creating and analyzing a challenging benchmark for reasoning, and showing that CoT prompting can unlock substantially better reasoning capabilities in large language models compared to few-shot prompting. The paper also provides insights into model scale and CoT interactions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is how I think it compares and contributes to other research in this field:

Overall Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important problem that has real-world applications and implications. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of large language models is key as these models become more widely deployed. 

- The paper thoroughly evaluates performance on a subset of challenging BIG-Bench tasks using novel prompting methods. This provides new insights into the abilities of state-of-the-art models like Codex and PaLM.

- The analysis of scaling laws and emergence when using chain-of-thought prompting is novel. This sheds light on how reasoning abilities can emerge in large models.

- Releasing the curated benchmark, prompts, and model outputs will be valuable for other researchers to build upon.

Key Differences from Prior Work:

- Whereas BIG-Bench evaluated few-shot performance, this work focuses on harder subsets and uses chain-of-thought prompting. This gives a clearer picture of true model capabilities.

- The scaling analysis with chain-of-thought prompting provides new insights compared to prior scaling law studies like Kaplan et al. 2020. 

- This work examines Modern massive models like Codex and PaLM, whereas BIG-Bench mainly evaluated models up to 175B parameters.

- This work introduces a rigorous task filtering process to identify the hardest BIG-Bench subsets. This focuses evaluations on the most challenging skills.

Limitations:

- The curated subset may still contain some ambiguous or poorly formulated tasks. More filtering may be needed.

- More analysis could be done around failure cases of chain-of-thought prompting.

- Larger models and more advanced prompting methods may continue to improve performance on this benchmark.

Overall, I believe this work makes important contributions over prior studies by rigorously evaluating challenging subsets of BIG-Bench using state-of-the-art models and prompting methods. The analysis provides valuable insights into model capabilities and limitations. Releasing the benchmark and data will enable more research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring other prompting strategies beyond chain-of-thought prompting to solve the remaining challenging tasks in BIG-Bench Hard. The authors note that chain-of-thought prompting does not fully unlock emergent task performance on all the tasks that exhibit flat scaling curves with standard prompting. Developing novel prompting techniques could further improve performance.

- Applying chain-of-thought prompting to other challenging benchmarks and tasks beyond BIG-Bench. The authors showed the efficacy of chain-of-thought prompting on BIG-Bench Hard, but prompting could likely also improve performance on other benchmarks.

- Scaling up models even further. The authors show that chain-of-thought prompting unlocks new capabilities with sufficient scale. Training even larger models could further build on these gains.

- Improving human baselines and evaluation. The authors note limitations in the human evaluation component of BIG-Bench in terms of representative raters and amount of time allotted per task. Establishing more robust human baselines would better contextualize model performance.

- Testing transfer of reasoning skills. While models can perform reasoning when prompted, it is unclear if they can transfer reasoning capabilities to new contexts and tasks. Evaluating transfer remains an open challenge.

- Developing methods to detect and avoid failure cases of chain-of-thought prompting, for example when modelshallucinate reasoning chains without grounding them properly.

- Establishing theoretical understanding of why and how prompting works, and when it can be expected to succeed or fail.

In summary, the authors point to many exciting research avenues related to pushing the limits of reasoning and language abilities in large language models via prompting techniques and scale. Robust human evaluation, theoretical grounding, and assessing transferability remain critical challenges as well.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper focuses on a subset of 23 challenging tasks from BIG-Bench called BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), which are tasks that prior language model evaluations did not outperform average human-rater performance on. The authors find that standard few-shot prompting underestimates model capabilities on these tasks, while chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables the Codex model to surpass average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 BBH tasks. CoT prompting requires sufficiently large models to be effective, and can unlock emergent task performance on BBH tasks that otherwise exhibit flat scaling curves. Overall, the paper demonstrates that CoT prompting captures the capabilities of large language models better than few-shot prompting for challenging reasoning tasks in BBH, though performance still lags behind the best human raters. The data, prompts, and model outputs are released to facilitate further research.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores a subset of 23 challenging tasks from BIG-Bench, referred to as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). The authors find that standard few-shot prompting, as done in prior BIG-Bench evaluations, underestimates the capabilities of large language models like Codex and PaLM. By using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which includes reasoning steps with the prompt, the authors are able to achieve better performance with Codex and PaLM on the BBH tasks. Specifically, Codex surpasses average human rater performance on 17 out of 23 BBH tasks using CoT prompting. 

The paper also studies the interaction between model scale and CoT prompting. The benefits of CoT prompting only emerge at sufficiently large model sizes. Furthermore, CoT prompting unlocks emergent task performance on several BBH tasks that otherwise exhibit flat scaling curves without CoT. Overall, this work demonstrates that CoT prompting better captures the capabilities of large language models on challenging reasoning tasks compared to standard few-shot prompting. The release of the BBH subset and CoT prompts will facilitate further research on reasoning abilities of language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper focuses on a subset of 23 challenging tasks from BIG-Bench called BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), which are tasks where prior language models have not exceeded average human-rater performance. The authors evaluate few-shot performance on BBH using two prompting methods - standard answer-only prompting and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting involves providing a few exemplars that show step-by-step reasoning leading to the final answer. The authors manually write CoT exemplars for all BBH tasks. They find that CoT prompting substantially improves performance over answer-only prompting for large language models like Codex and PaLM, enabling them to surpass average human-rater scores on over half of the BBH tasks. The gains from CoT prompting increase with model scale and unlock emergent task performance on several BBH tasks that otherwise exhibit flat scaling curves. This suggests that CoT prompting better captures the capabilities of large language models on complex reasoning tasks compared to standard few-shot prompting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key questions and problems it is addressing are:

- How do chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts affect the performance of large language models on a subset of challenging tasks from BIG-Bench? 

- Can CoT prompting enable large language models to surpass average reported human-rater performance on tasks they previously fell short on with standard prompting?

- What is the interaction between model scale and CoT prompting? Does CoT prompting unlock emergent abilities in large models that are not seen at smaller scales?

- Does CoT prompting actually work better than standard prompting for challenging reasoning tasks that likely require decomposing problems into multiple steps? Or does it hurt performance?

Specifically, the paper focuses on a subset of 23 tasks from BIG-Bench where prior models did not exceed average human-rater performance. This subset is referred to as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). The key questions explored are whether CoT prompting improves performance on BBH over standard prompting, and whether it enables the top models to exceed average human-rater scores.

The results suggest that CoT prompting does substantially improve performance over standard prompting on BBH. Additionally, by using CoT prompting, the Codex model is able to surpass average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 BBH tasks, compared to just 5 tasks with standard prompting. The analysis also explores model scale vs. CoT interactions and how CoT can unlock emergent abilities.

In summary, the key focus is analyzing whether CoT prompting can push the limits of large language models on challenging reasoning tasks compared to standard prompting. The BBH subset provides a testbed for studying this question.
