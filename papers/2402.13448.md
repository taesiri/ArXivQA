# [ED-Copilot: Reduce Emergency Department Wait Time with Language Model   Diagnostic Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13448)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emergency department (ED) crowding is a major healthcare challenge that impacts patient outcomes and staff burnout. A key factor causing crowding is long patient wait times due to lengthy diagnostic testing processes.

- Reducing ED length of stay (LOS) by streamlining the testing process can improve throughput and reduce crowding. However, testing is crucial for accurate diagnoses so simply eliminating tests harms care quality. 

Solution - ED-Copilot System:
- The paper proposes an AI "Co-Pilot" system called ED-Copilot to provide cost-effective diagnostic assistance. The goal is to minimize ED LOS by selectively recommending the most informative lab tests for each patient.

- ED-Copilot uses a pretrained biomedical language model (BioGPT) that encodes patient triage details and test results into a single text sequence. An LSTM then suggests the next best test group to order based on this sequence.  

- A reinforcement learning (RL) approach teaches the model to balance lab test informativeness with minimizing total test time. This allows personalized lab recommendations that reduce LOS without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Contributions:

- Creates MIMIC-ED-Assist benchmark dataset with real patient data and clinically relevant test groupings and outcomes to evaluate AI diagnostic assistants.

- Proposes ED-Copilot model that uses BioGPT and RL to provide personalized lab test suggestions that improve predictive accuracy while cutting the average lab testing time in half.

- Analysis shows ED-Copilot better handles atypical patient cases compared to non-personalized methods. Also suggests reasonable tests even for those not done historically.

- Work enables future research into AI solutions for reducing ED crowding and serve as prototype for real-world pilot studies.
