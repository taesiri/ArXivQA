# [Efficient argument classification with compact language models and   ChatGPT-4 refinements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15473)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Argument mining (AM) aims to automatically identify and analyze the argumentative structure and components within texts. It has growing relevance across domains, but model performance needs further improvement. 

- Prior AM models like SVM, RNNs had limitations in capturing contextual information. Recent transformer-based models like BERT made progress but still face challenges.

- This paper explores using compact transformer models enhanced with refinements from large language models to boost AM efficiency.

Methods
- Experiments conducted across 3 datasets: US2016 corpus, Moral Maze (UKP) corpus, Args.me corpus, covering range of argument types.

- Base models: DistilBERT and BERT (compact transformer models).

- Refinement: Further fine-tuned using ChatGPT-4 (large language model) for low-confidence subset of arguments to improve classification. 

- Overall model is BERT+ChatGPT-4 hybrid that balances efficiency and performance.

Results
- On all datasets, BERT+ChatGPT-4 outperforms base BERT and DistilBERT for argument classification accuracy.

- Highest gains seen for Args.me (16% F1 score increase) and US2016 corpus (10% F1 increase).

- Analysis of ChatGPT-4 errors highlights limitations in processing logical connectives, sarcasm etc.

Conclusions
- Demonstrated feasibility of enhancing compact transformer models via targeted large language model refinements.

- Future work will expand to other large language models and prompt-based techniques to further boost AM performance.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposed BERT+ChatGPT-4 model that combines efficiency and strong accuracy for argument mining across diverse datasets. Results validate this hybrid approach, while analysis offers insights for further improvements.
