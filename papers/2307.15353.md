# [Supervised Homography Learning with Realistic Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15353)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to generate a realistic dataset with ground truth homography labels to train supervised homography learning methods. The key points are:- Existing supervised homography learning methods rely on synthetic datasets generated by warping single images, which lack realistic motion and scene parallax. This limits their performance on real-world images. - The authors propose an iterative framework to generate realistic image pairs with ground truth homography from unlabeled image pairs captured in real scenes. - The framework alternates between a generation phase and a training phase. In the generation phase, a new target image is synthesized using estimated masks and homographies from pre-trained networks. In the training phase, the generated pairs are used to train a homography estimation network.- Additional modules are proposed to refine the generated images and select high-quality pairs for training. - Through this iterative process, the dataset quality and network performance are mutually improved. Experiments show state-of-the-art results and improved generalization of supervised methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that generating a realistic supervised dataset iteratively alongside network training can improve supervised homography learning and its applicability to real-world images. The proposed framework aims to address the lack of realistic datasets for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes an iterative deep framework to simultaneously generate a realistic dataset for supervised homography learning and train a high-precision homography estimation network. 2. It introduces a generation phase and a training phase that reinforce each other. In the generation phase, it uses estimated dominant plane masks and homography to synthesize new labeled image pairs that meet both label and realism criteria. In the training phase, it proposes a content consistency module and a quality assessment module to refine the generated images and select high-quality pairs for training the network. 3. Through the iterative process, both the quality of the generated dataset and the performance of the trained network are gradually improved. 4. Experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks and helps improve existing supervised methods when trained on the generated dataset.In summary, the main contribution is an iterative mutual bootstrapping framework to simultaneously obtain high-quality training data and a robust supervised homography estimation network. The key innovation is the integration of data generation and network training to reinforce each other in a loop.
