# [TULIP: Transformer for Upsampling of LiDAR Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- LiDAR point clouds are essential for various autonomy tasks like mapping, localization and object detection. However, the resolution of LiDAR point clouds is limited by factors like energy consumption and cost. Upscaling LiDAR point clouds to higher resolution can benefit these downstream tasks. 
- Prior works convert the 3D point cloud to a 2D range image and formulate this as an image super-resolution problem. However, range images have distinct properties compared to regular RGB images that most image SR methods are designed for. So directly applying image SR methods performs poorly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes TULIP, a Transformer-based network tailored for upsampling LiDAR range images. 
- It is based on Swin Transformer but uses a row-based patch partitioning to retain vertical image details. It also uses a rectangular window for local self-attention to handle discontinuities between objects at different scales.
- Additional modifications like circular padding, patch unmerging layers and Monte Carlo dropout are used.

Main Contributions:
- A customized transformer architecture for effectively handling properties of range images like sharp edges and non-uniform distribution of details.
- Extensive comparison against state-of-the-art LiDAR upsampling and image super-resolution methods on real-world and simulated datasets.
- Significantly outperforms prior works both quantitatively and qualitatively. Achieves lower error and generates more realistic high-res point clouds.

In summary, the paper proposes a specialized transformer network called TULIP for upsampling LiDAR range images to high-resolution. By customizing the architecture for range images, it outperforms previous approaches on this task.
