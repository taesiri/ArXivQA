# [Grid Monitoring and Protection with Continuous Point-on-Wave   Measurements and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06942)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The power grid is undergoing major changes with increasing renewable energy and reduced inertia, making it more dynamic and operating near stability limits. This makes the current grid monitoring systems like SCADA and PMUs inadequate.  
- There is a need for high-resolution wide-area monitoring to capture grid events and dynamics using continuous point-on-wave (CPOW) measurements. However, streaming raw CPOW data requires large bandwidth.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a grid monitoring and control framework based on compressed CPOW data streaming and AI-powered analytics for detection and situational awareness. 
- Use an "innovation autoencoder" based on classic Wiener-Kallianpur theory to extract an IID innovation sequence from CPOW measurements.
- Combine sub-band coding and innovation autoencoder for efficient CPOW compression. Allocate distortion across sub-bands optimally.
- Formulate anomaly detection as non-parametric hypothesis testing in the innovation domain using Neyman's Smooth Test.
- Implement a doubling search procedure for low-latency sequential fault detection.

Key Contributions:
- Novel CPOW compression architecture combining subband coding, innovation autoencoder and vector quantization.
- Formulation and method for distribution-based anomaly detection on CPOW data using learned innovation features.
- Demonstrated innovation-based sequential fault detection for overcurrent protection - improved accuracy by 16% and speed by 68% over baselines.
- Overall, the paper makes a case for AI-powered CPOW streaming and analytics being critical for next-gen dynamic grid monitoring compared to limitations of SCADA and PMUs.
