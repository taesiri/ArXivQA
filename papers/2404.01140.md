# [KoCoNovel: Annotated Dataset of Character Coreference in Korean Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01140)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of coreference resolution datasets for Korean literary texts. Existing datasets are either in English or sourced from non-literary domains like news and conversations. 
- Literary texts have unique considerations like changes in entity identity over the course of the narrative and asymmetry in knowledge between readers, characters and narrators.
- The Korean language also has specific linguistic and cultural aspects like lack of determiners, extensive use of address terms denoting social relationships rather than names, and omission of arguments.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop the KoCoNovel dataset - a Korean literary character coreference corpus of 178K words annotated from 50 modern and contemporary novels.
- They establish new annotation guidelines tailored for Korean by revising span selection, distinguishing between generic and specific mentions, and treating pronouns differently.
- The dataset has four distinct versions to accommodate different needs: Reader vs Omniscient perspective and Separate vs Overlapped treatment of entities.
- 24% of mentions are single common nouns, reflecting Korean address term culture. Proper names account for 23% and pronominals 30% of mentions.

Main Contributions:
- First ever Korean literary character coreference dataset with detailed annotation guidelines customized for Korean linguistic and cultural nuances.
- Analysis of mention types reveals prevalence of address terms in Korean literature. 
- Experiments show BERT-based models trained on KoCoNovel outperform models trained on a larger non-literary dataset in literary coreference tasks.
- The dataset's multiple versions support diverse literary analysis needs regarding perspectives and entity treatment.
