# WizardLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Follow Complex   Instructions

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper seems to be:How can an evolutionary algorithm be used to automatically generate diverse and complex instruction data to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs)? The key ideas appear to be:- Human creation of instruction data for LLMs is expensive, time-consuming, and tends to skew towards lower difficulty levels.- An evolutionary algorithm called Evol-Instruct is proposed to automatically generate varied and complex instruction data instead. - Evol-Instruct starts with a simple seed dataset and uses an LLM to iteratively rewrite/evolve the instructions to make them more complex via depth-first (increase complexity) or breadth-first (increase diversity) strategies.- Instructions also go through a filtering process to eliminate low-quality outputs.- The evolved dataset is used to fine-tune an LLM called WizardLM.- Evaluations on a custom test set and against models like Alpaca, Vicuna, and ChatGPT aim to demonstrate that:  - Evol-Instruct produces superior instruction data compared to human-created datasets    - WizardLM outperforms other models, especially on complex instructionsSo in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that automatic evolution of instruction data can improve LLM performance, which is tested through comparative evaluations. The key innovation is the Evol-Instruct evolutionary algorithm for generating the instruction data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing Evol-Instruct, a novel method that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate diverse and complex instruction data for training other LLMs. 2. Demonstrating that fine-tuning LLMs on the instruction data generated by Evol-Instruct improves their performance on complex tasks compared to fine-tuning on human-generated instruction data.3. Showing that their model fine-tuned on Evol-Instruct data, called WizardLM, outperforms competitive baselines like Alpaca and Vicuna on a complexity-balanced test set.4. Providing evidence through human evaluations that outputs from WizardLM are preferred over ChatGPT for high complexity instructions.5. Analyzing the depth and breadth of instructions generated by Evol-Instruct to show they are more complex and diverse than human-written instructions.6. Discussing the potential of using AI-generated instructions to enhance LLMs while also acknowledging limitations of current evaluation methods.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and validating a novel automatic method to generate complex instruction data that can enhance LLM performance, especially on complex tasks, compared to human-generated data. The key innovation is using LLMs themselves to recursively generate more complex instructions.
