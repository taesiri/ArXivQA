# [WizardLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Follow Complex   Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper seems to be:How can an evolutionary algorithm be used to automatically generate diverse and complex instruction data to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs)? The key ideas appear to be:- Human creation of instruction data for LLMs is expensive, time-consuming, and tends to skew towards lower difficulty levels.- An evolutionary algorithm called Evol-Instruct is proposed to automatically generate varied and complex instruction data instead. - Evol-Instruct starts with a simple seed dataset and uses an LLM to iteratively rewrite/evolve the instructions to make them more complex via depth-first (increase complexity) or breadth-first (increase diversity) strategies.- Instructions also go through a filtering process to eliminate low-quality outputs.- The evolved dataset is used to fine-tune an LLM called WizardLM.- Evaluations on a custom test set and against models like Alpaca, Vicuna, and ChatGPT aim to demonstrate that:  - Evol-Instruct produces superior instruction data compared to human-created datasets    - WizardLM outperforms other models, especially on complex instructionsSo in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that automatic evolution of instruction data can improve LLM performance, which is tested through comparative evaluations. The key innovation is the Evol-Instruct evolutionary algorithm for generating the instruction data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing Evol-Instruct, a novel method that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate diverse and complex instruction data for training other LLMs. 2. Demonstrating that fine-tuning LLMs on the instruction data generated by Evol-Instruct improves their performance on complex tasks compared to fine-tuning on human-generated instruction data.3. Showing that their model fine-tuned on Evol-Instruct data, called WizardLM, outperforms competitive baselines like Alpaca and Vicuna on a complexity-balanced test set.4. Providing evidence through human evaluations that outputs from WizardLM are preferred over ChatGPT for high complexity instructions.5. Analyzing the depth and breadth of instructions generated by Evol-Instruct to show they are more complex and diverse than human-written instructions.6. Discussing the potential of using AI-generated instructions to enhance LLMs while also acknowledging limitations of current evaluation methods.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and validating a novel automatic method to generate complex instruction data that can enhance LLM performance, especially on complex tasks, compared to human-generated data. The key innovation is using LLMs themselves to recursively generate more complex instructions.

The authors of the paper suggest several promising future research directions based on their work:1. Developing more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) trained with AI-evolved instructions.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a new approach for training reinforcement learning agents in complex 3D environments like Minecraft. The key idea is to use self-supervised learning to enable the agent to acquire useful skills and representations before tackling the main task. Specifically, the agent is first trained on pixel level prediction tasks that require predicting the future states of the environment based on past frames. This self-supervised pretraining enables the agent to learn generally useful features and skills for navigation and interaction. The pretrained agent is then trained with reinforcement learning on the actual tasks of interest like mining diamonds or building structures. The results show that this approach leads to significantly more sample efficient reinforcement learning compared to learning from scratch. Agents pretrained with self-supervision are able to solve tasks in substantially fewer environment steps compared to non-pretrained agents. The work demonstrates how self-supervised learning can provide an effective pretraining strategy to enable reinforcement learning agents to learn useful skills and representations before tackling complex, sparse reward tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a new approach for few-shot learning called FEAT. Few-shot learning aims to learn new concepts from very few labeled examples. FEAT improves few-shot learning performance by learning a more general and transferable feature representation. The key idea behind FEAT is to train the feature extractor network to maximally align the distributions of individual sample features and class mean features. This is achieved through a novel loss function that minimizes the difference between the sample feature distribution and the class mean feature distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple few-shot learning benchmarks demonstrate that FEAT consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. The performance gains are especially significant in the more challenging cross-domain evaluation settings. Overall, the FEAT approach provides an effective way to learn feature representations that generalize better to novel categories from limited labeled data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents a method for automatic instruction generation and enhancement using large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to leverage LLMs to iteratively evolve an initial set of human-written instructions to make them more complex and diverse. The process starts with a seed set of instructions and responses. In each evolution round, instructions are selected and rewritten into more difficult versions or mutated into completely novel instructions using prompts designed to get the LLM to make specific modifications. The rewritten instructions are filtered to eliminate invalid ones. The evolved instructions and newly generated responses are added back to the pool. After multiple rounds, the final evolved instruction set contains varied complexity levels and topics. This dataset is then used to fine-tune an LLM, called WizardLM, which outperforms models trained on human-only instructions. The evolution prompts and process enables automatic generation of challenging instructions at scale.
