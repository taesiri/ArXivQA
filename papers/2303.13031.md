# [Learning a Practical SDR-to-HDRTV Up-conversion using New Dataset and   Degradation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: 

Existing learning-based methods for SDR-to-HDRTV upconversion produce results that are dimmer and less saturated compared to the ground truth HDR, leading to unsatisfactory viewing experiences. The authors hypothesize that this deficiency is due to flaws in the training datasets and degradation models used. 

Specifically, the paper investigates:

- The impact of training dataset quality on upconversion performance, proposing a new high-quality dataset (HDRTV4K) with improved diversity and extent of HDR/WCG. 

- The effect of different HDR-to-SDR degradation models on learned upconversion styles, proposing new models that avoid excessive alterations in brightness and saturation.

- A new luminance-segmented network architecture tailored for the task by processing different luminance ranges distinctly. 

The overarching hypothesis is that by improving the training data and models, the proposed method will produce HDRTV results with superior quality, recovering more HDR/WCG volume while avoiding dimmer and desaturated outputs compared to prior arts. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
