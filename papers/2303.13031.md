# [Learning a Practical SDR-to-HDRTV Up-conversion using New Dataset and   Degradation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: 

Existing learning-based methods for SDR-to-HDRTV upconversion produce results that are dimmer and less saturated compared to the ground truth HDR, leading to unsatisfactory viewing experiences. The authors hypothesize that this deficiency is due to flaws in the training datasets and degradation models used. 

Specifically, the paper investigates:

- The impact of training dataset quality on upconversion performance, proposing a new high-quality dataset (HDRTV4K) with improved diversity and extent of HDR/WCG. 

- The effect of different HDR-to-SDR degradation models on learned upconversion styles, proposing new models that avoid excessive alterations in brightness and saturation.

- A new luminance-segmented network architecture tailored for the task by processing different luminance ranges distinctly. 

The overarching hypothesis is that by improving the training data and models, the proposed method will produce HDRTV results with superior quality, recovering more HDR/WCG volume while avoiding dimmer and desaturated outputs compared to prior arts. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It emphasizes the importance of the training set (dataset + degradation model) for the task of SDR-to-HDRTV up-conversion, which has been understated in prior work. 

2. It proposes a new high-quality dataset called HDRTV4K with diverse HDR frames as labels. It also proposes 3 new degradation models to generate proper SDR inputs for training.

3. It formulates the task as a combination of global mapping and recovery of low/high luminance ranges. Accordingly, it proposes a luminance segmented network (LSN) with a global trunk and Transformer UNet branches for different luminance ranges. 

4. It updates the assessment criteria with fine-grained metrics and a subjective experiment to evaluate the perceptual quality.

5. Experiments show the proposed method outperforms previous methods and commercial software in recovering HDR/WCG volume while enhancing brightness/saturation. Ablations verify the importance of the proposed dataset and degradation models.

In summary, this paper makes contributions in the training data, network design, problem formulation, and evaluation metrics for SDR-to-HDRTV up-conversion. It demonstrates the importance of considering perceptual quality for this low-level vision task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a new method for learning-based SDR-to-HDRTV up-conversion. The key ideas are:

1) Improving the training data by creating a new high-quality HDRTV dataset (HDRTV4K) and novel degradation models to generate the SDR images. 

2) Formulating the problem as recovering dark/bright areas and global mapping, then designing a luminance-segmented network (LSN) accordingly.

3) Updating the assessment criteria with tailored metrics and subjective tests instead of just conventional metrics.

Overall, the method aims to produce visually pleasing HDRTV output that properly utilizes the wider dynamic range and color gamut, especially in dark/bright areas. This is achieved through careful training data curation and a network designed for the specific formulation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on SDR-to-HDR TV up-conversion:

- Focus on training data: This paper places a strong emphasis on the impact of the training data (dataset and degradation models) on the performance of learning-based up-conversion methods. Many existing methods focus more on novel network architectures and less on the data. The authors argue that improving the training data is crucial for good performance.

- New dataset: The paper introduces a new dataset called HDRTV4K that contains higher quality and more diverse HDR frames compared to existing datasets like KAIST and HDRTV1K. This is intended to provide better supervision for networks.

- New degradation models: The paper proposes 3 new data degradation models that avoid deficiencies in saturation and brightness changes compared to commonly used models like YouTube and Reinhard. This is meant to lead to more realistic learned mappings.

- Assessment criteria: The paper advocates using more perceptually-relevant assessment criteria like tailored metrics and subjective experiments rather than conventional metrics like PSNR. This better matches the end goal of a pleasing HDR viewing experience.

- Luminance-segmented network: A new network architecture is proposed that separately processes low, medium, and high luminance regions which require different operations. This contrasts with most methods that use end-to-end mappings.

Overall, the emphasis on training data and subjective quality assessment differentiates this work from existing literature that is more network-focused. The insights on data impact and evaluation could inform future research in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop more advanced degradation models for training data. The authors suggest exploring more complex and realistic degradation models to better simulate real-world SDR content and bridge the gap between synthetic training data and real testing data. 

- Improve assessment criteria. The authors recommend developing more advanced quality assessment methods, both objective metrics and subjective studies, that correlate better with human perceptual judgments of HDR quality. This could help more accurately evaluate different SDR-to-HDR methods.

- Explore other network architectures. While the authors propose a luminance segmented network, they suggest exploring other network designs that may be better suited for this task, such as recursive networks, generative adversarial networks, etc.

- Focus on temporal consistency. For video SDR-to-HDR conversion, maintaining temporal coherence across frames is important but challenging. The authors recommend developing techniques to improve temporal stability.

- Investigate joint up-conversion. The authors propose looking into joint up-conversion of other attributes besides resolution, such as frame rate, bit depth, etc. This could allow simultaneously enhancing multiple aspects of SDR video.

- Study adaptive up-conversion. The authors suggest researching content-adaptive and display-adaptive SDR-to-HDR conversion that takes into account characteristics of the source content and target display to optimize image quality.

In summary, the main future directions pointed out are improving training data realism, developing better quality assessment, exploring new network architectures, and studying joint/adaptive up-conversion. Enhancing these aspects could help advance SDR-to-HDR conversion research and move closer to practical applications.
