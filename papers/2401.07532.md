# [Multi-view MidiVAE: Fusing Track- and Bar-view Representations for Long   Multi-track Symbolic Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing VAE approaches for symbolic music generation struggle to model long multi-track music pieces. Issues include:
1) 1D representations neglect relationships between notes, limiting learning of musical structure
2) Long input sequences increase computational burden  
3) Processing music bar-by-bar loses global coherence

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce Multi-view MidiVAE to effectively model and generate long multi-track symbolic music
- Uses 2D OctupleMIDI representation to capture note relationships and reduce sequence length
- Employs dual Track- and Bar-view VAEs to focus on global/local aspects:
    - Track-view models instrumentation and harmony 
    - Bar-view concentrates on finer note details
- Fuses track and bar latent features via hybrid variational encoding/decoding
- Jointly reconstructs original, track and bar sequence views 

Main Contributions:
- First VAE approach to effectively tackle long multi-track symbolic music modeling/generation
- Leverages 2D OctupleMIDI to enhance learning and reduce computational load
- Novel hybrid variational schema fusing track- and bar-level latent features 
- Dual track/bar models concentrate on global vs local musical aspects
- Experiments show significant gains over baselines in reconstruction and generation quality

In summary, the paper introduces a multi-view VAE architecture using a 2D music representation to overcome limitations in handling long, multi-track symbolic music. The dual view track/bar modeling strategy balances global coherence with local detail. Both objective and subjective results validate gains over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Multi-view MidiVAE, a variational autoencoder approach that effectively models and generates long multi-track symbolic music by fusing track- and bar-view representations to focus on global structure, local details, instrumentation, and harmony.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Multi-view MidiVAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that effectively models and generates long multi-track symbolic music. Specifically:

1) It introduces the OctupleMIDI representation to capture relationships between notes and reduce sequence length compared to prior 1D representations. 

2) It proposes a hybrid variational encoding-decoding strategy with Track-view and Bar-view MidiVAEs to focus on global/local information and instrumental characteristics/harmony of the musical composition. 

3) Experiments on the CocoChorales dataset demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstructing and generating long multi-track symbolic music. This validates Multi-view MidiVAE as an efficient VAE approach for this task.

In summary, the key innovation is using the OctupleMIDI representation and a multi-view hybrid VAE architecture to address the challenge of modeling and generating coherent long sequences of multi-track symbolic music.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

- Symbolic music generation - The paper focuses on generating symbolic representations of music, rather than audio waveforms. 

- Variational autoencoders (VAEs) - The proposed model is based on VAEs for modeling and generating symbolic music.

- Multi-track - The paper tackles generating multi-track symbolic music, where there are multiple instruments played together. 

- Long sequences - A key challenge is generating long sequences of multi-track symbolic music.

- OctupleMIDI - A 2D representation that is used to capture relationships between notes and reduce sequence length.

- Multi-view - The model has separate Track-view and Bar-view components to focus on global vs local information. 

- Hybrid variational encoding/decoding - Integrates the Track- and Bar-view representations via a hybrid variational strategy.

- Objective and subjective evaluation - Both quantitative metrics and human listening tests are used to evaluate the models.

In summary, the key focus is on using VAEs and multi-view representations to tackle long multi-track symbolic music generation. The OctupleMIDI, Track-view, Bar-view, and hybrid encoding components aim to address limitations with prior VAE approaches.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a 2D representation called OctupleMIDI instead of a 1D representation. What are the key advantages of using a 2D representation over a 1D representation for modeling long multi-track symbolic music?

2. The paper employs a hybrid variational encoding-decoding strategy. What is the intuition behind fusing the track-view and bar-view representations instead of using only one view? What are the potential benefits of this strategy?

3. The track-view MidiVAE focuses on modeling global information and instrumental characteristics. What specific components allow it to capture these high-level musical aspects effectively? 

4. The bar-view MidiVAE concentrates on local details within bars. What architectural designs enable it to learn these finer-grained patterns in the music?

5. The multi-view information fusion module concatenates the track-view and bar-view embeddings. Why is convolution used subsequently rather than a simpler fully connected layer? What might be the motivation behind this design?

6. The adaptive feature fusion module uses a learnable weight vector alpha to fuse the decoded track-view and bar-view probability matrices. Why is an adaptive weighting scheme used here rather than a static weighting or simple averaging?

7. The model is trained to reconstruct the original sequence as well as the track-view and bar-view sequences. What is the motivation behind using these additional auxiliary reconstruction losses? 

8. The proposed model utilizes transformers whereas prior work used LSTMs. What benefits might transformers provide over RNN architectures for modeling symbolic music?

9. The experiments show significant improvements over strong baselines like MusicVAE. What one or two biggest limitations of prior VAE methods are addressed by the proposed approach? 

10. The model still does not match the ground truth performance per the results. What are one or two potential areas of improvement that can be explored in future work to further boost the performance?
