# [The impact of heteroskedasticity on uplift modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05234)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper examines the problem of heteroskedasticity (unequal variability in model errors across observations) in uplift modeling and how it can lead to ranking bias when the models are used to prioritize treatment allocation. The authors show that uplift models tend to have higher variance (more unpredictable predictions) for observations with more unexplained variance in the outcome. This means that by chance, more of these noisy observations will get extreme high or low effect predictions, pushing them to the very top or bottom of the ranking. If high outcome variance also tends to coincide with high actual treatment effect (as the authors argue is often true in applications like marketing), this means the models will erroneously rank many of the highest effect individuals at the very bottom. The authors demonstrate this problem on simulated data and on a Criteo marketing dataset, where a treatment effect model performs worse than an outcome prediction model for ranking individuals by expected benefit. They discuss the serious implications this can have for the usefulness of uplift modeling in applications where treatment is allocated based on prediction rank. Finally, they suggest potential solutions like selective treatment of bottom-ranked individuals or use of hybrid outcome/uplift prioritization.
