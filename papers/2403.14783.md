# [Multi-Agent VQA: Exploring Multi-Agent Foundation Models in Zero-Shot   Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14783)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Visual question answering (VQA) models require extensive fine-tuning on specific datasets and have limited generalization ability to new datasets. This limits their practical usage in real-world settings.
- Existing vision-language models also struggle with detecting objects, understanding relationships between objects, and counting objects when not fine-tuned.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an adaptive multi-agent VQA system that utilizes both a large vision-language foundation model (LVLM) and other specialized agents.
- The system first allows the LVLM to attempt answering the VQA question directly. 
- If the LVLM cannot answer, specialized agents are adaptively called to assist:
  - An LLM parsing agent detects cases when the LVLM missed key objects or needs to count objects.
  - Object detection and object counting agents localize missing objects and count objects as needed.
  - Additional LVLM agents describe attributes of detected objects.
- After getting object descriptions, the main LVLM reattempts answering the VQA question.
- Answers are evaluated by LLM grading agents rather than exact match to annotations.

Main Contributions:
- First exploration of zero-shot capabilities of LVLM foundation models on VQA tasks without fine-tuning on VQA datasets.
- Proposal of an adaptive multi-agent system that utilizes specialized agents to overcome limitations of LVLMs for object detection, counting, etc.
- Introduction of LLM answer grading for more practical open-ended evaluation.
- Analysis of performance on VQA-v2 and GQA datasets, significantly outperforming fine-tuned models in zero-shot case.

The key insight is that specialized agents can be used adaptively as tools to complement foundation LVLM models without additional fine-tuning. This allows better practical usage for VQA while retaining strengths of foundation models.
