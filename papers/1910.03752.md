# [Probability, valuations, hyperspace: Three monads on Top and the support   as a morphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03752)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces three monads on the category of topological spaces - the Hoare hyperspace monad H, the monad V of continuous valuations, and the monad P of tau-smooth probability measures. It shows that V and P can be constructed via double dualization, revealing a close analogy between them and with H. The main result is that taking the support of a continuous valuation is a morphism of monads V -> H. This implies that every H-algebra is also a V-algebra in a canonical way. In particular, taking the support of a tau-smooth probability measure is a morphism of monads P -> H.Some key aspects:- H, V, P are constructed via double dualization, using pairings with the Sierpinski space (for H) and the extended reals (for V, P). This simplifies proofs.- H assigns to a space its closed subsets with the lower Vietoris topology. V assigns continuous valuations, P assigns tau-smooth probability measures.- H-algebras are topological complete join-semilattices. V-algebras are weakly locally convex topological cones.- The support map is constructed explicitly. Its continuity and naturality are shown. Compatibility with monad structures is proven by unfolding definitions.- H, V, P are commutative monads, allowing formation of products. The support map respects products.In summary, the paper introduces probability-like monads on Top, shows they are analogous, and proves the support map relating them is a morphism of monoidal monads. This allows transferring concepts and results between probabilistic and possibilistic settings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper introduces and studies three monads on the category of topological spaces - the Hoare hyperspace monad $H$, the valuation monad $V$, and the probability monad $P$. Other works have studied monads related to probability and nondeterminism, but this seems to be the first comprehensive treatment of these three specific monads in this generality.- The paper takes a very categorical approach, constructing the monads systematically via double dualization. Other works have constructed related monads more directly using measure theory. The categorical perspective here provides insight into the structural similarities between the monads.- The main novelty is proving that taking supports is a morphism of monads $V\to H$ and $P\to H$. This formalizes the passage from probabilistic to nondeterministic computation. I'm not aware of other results establishing this connection for such general monads.- The monads here are defined on the whole category of topological spaces. Other probability monads have been studied on more restrictive categories like Polish spaces or compact Hausdorff spaces. Defining the monad $P$ on all of Top seems to be new.- The paper relates all three monads $H$, $V$, and $P$ in a unified framework. Other works have tended to focus on just one of these monads. Seeing them constructed and related in parallel provides more insight.- The paper mostly synthesizes and expands on known results, giving a comprehensive and self-contained treatment. The main novel contribution is the morphism of monads for supports. Overall it provides a solid reference for these monads and their relationships.In summary, the paper offers a thorough, categorical perspective on these monads encompassing both probabilistic and nondeterministic structure. Making precise the relationship between probability and nondeterminism via the support morphism is a valuable contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Develop a general categorical framework for double dualization monads that would encompass the monads H and V studied in this paper. The authors note that their construction of H and V through double dualization gives them the flavor of double dualization monads, but they are not aware of an existing framework that would accommodate them. - Obtain a full characterization of the algebras of the continuous valuation monad V. The authors state that this seems difficult, but mention some partial characterizations obtained by other researchers.- Investigate whether the double dualization construction of H and V can be made to work more generally, beyond the cases of dualizing with respect to S and R+. The authors suggest this could lead to a unified perspective on H and V.- Explore applications of the morphism of monads from valuations to closed subsets (V → H) in denotational semantics, to formalize the passage from probabilistic to nondeterministic computation.- Develop synthetic versions of weak convergence of measures and tightness using the monadic formalism. The authors note their monad P seems expressive enough to hope for such developments.- Study signed or complex-valued variations of the monads and results in this paper. The authors provide some indications that the support may not be well-behaved for signed measures.In summary, the main directions suggested are: developing a more general categorical framework, obtaining sharper characterization results, exploring variations and extensions of the constructions, and investigating applications in semantics and synthetic measure theory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper considers three monads on the category of topological spaces - the Hoare hyperspace monad $H$, the monad $V$ of continuous valuations, and the monad $P$ of $\tau$-smooth Borel probability measures. The authors construct $H$ and $V$ in a unified way using double dualization, revealing a close analogy between them. They show that taking the support of a continuous valuation is a morphism of monads $V\to H$, implying that the supports of $\tau$-smooth probability measures form a morphism of monads $P\to H$. This formalizes the passage from probabilistic computation to nondeterministic computation. The paper also studies products and projections for these monads, showing that they are commutative (or symmetric monoidal) monads.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper studies three monads on the category of topological spaces - the Hoare hyperspace monad $H$, the monad of continuous valuations $V$, and the monad of $\tau$-smooth probability measures $P$. The first part of the paper introduces $H$ and $V$ and constructs them via double dualization, revealing a close analogy between them. $H$ assigns to a space $X$ its space of closed subsets with the lower Vietoris topology, while $V$ assigns to $X$ the space of continuous valuations with the weak topology of convergence for integration against lower semicontinuous functions. The second part shows that $P$ is a submonad of $V$, and that taking the support of a continuous valuation or $\tau$-smooth probability measure is a morphism of monads $\text{supp} : V \to H$ and $\text{supp} : P \to H$. This implies that the supports respect the monoidal structure, so that the support of a product measure is the product of the supports. As a consequence, every $H$-algebra has a canonical $V$-algebra structure. The paper provides a unified treatment of known results on these monads, and the morphism of monads relating $V$ to $H$ seems to be new.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper constructs monads $H$, $V$, and $P$ on the category of topological spaces $\cat{Top}$ that represent various notions of possibility and probability. The monads $H$ and $V$ are defined through a double dualization procedure using the Sierpiński space $S$ and the extended nonnegative reals $\Rplusext$. This reveals a close analogy between $H$ and $V$ and facilitates proofs. $H$ assigns to a space $X$ its Hoare hyperspace $HX$ of closed subsets with the lower Vietoris topology. $V$ assigns to $X$ its space $VX$ of continuous valuations. The monad $P$ of $\tau$-smooth probability measures is constructed as a submonad of $V$. The main result is that taking the support of a continuous valuation is a morphism of monads $\supp: V \to H$. This implies that the algebras of $H$ are also algebras of $V$.
