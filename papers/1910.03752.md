# [Probability, valuations, hyperspace: Three monads on Top and the support   as a morphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03752)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces three monads on the category of topological spaces - the Hoare hyperspace monad H, the monad V of continuous valuations, and the monad P of tau-smooth probability measures. It shows that V and P can be constructed via double dualization, revealing a close analogy between them and with H. The main result is that taking the support of a continuous valuation is a morphism of monads V -> H. This implies that every H-algebra is also a V-algebra in a canonical way. In particular, taking the support of a tau-smooth probability measure is a morphism of monads P -> H.Some key aspects:- H, V, P are constructed via double dualization, using pairings with the Sierpinski space (for H) and the extended reals (for V, P). This simplifies proofs.- H assigns to a space its closed subsets with the lower Vietoris topology. V assigns continuous valuations, P assigns tau-smooth probability measures.- H-algebras are topological complete join-semilattices. V-algebras are weakly locally convex topological cones.- The support map is constructed explicitly. Its continuity and naturality are shown. Compatibility with monad structures is proven by unfolding definitions.- H, V, P are commutative monads, allowing formation of products. The support map respects products.In summary, the paper introduces probability-like monads on Top, shows they are analogous, and proves the support map relating them is a morphism of monoidal monads. This allows transferring concepts and results between probabilistic and possibilistic settings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper introduces and studies three monads on the category of topological spaces - the Hoare hyperspace monad $H$, the valuation monad $V$, and the probability monad $P$. Other works have studied monads related to probability and nondeterminism, but this seems to be the first comprehensive treatment of these three specific monads in this generality.- The paper takes a very categorical approach, constructing the monads systematically via double dualization. Other works have constructed related monads more directly using measure theory. The categorical perspective here provides insight into the structural similarities between the monads.- The main novelty is proving that taking supports is a morphism of monads $V\to H$ and $P\to H$. This formalizes the passage from probabilistic to nondeterministic computation. I'm not aware of other results establishing this connection for such general monads.- The monads here are defined on the whole category of topological spaces. Other probability monads have been studied on more restrictive categories like Polish spaces or compact Hausdorff spaces. Defining the monad $P$ on all of Top seems to be new.- The paper relates all three monads $H$, $V$, and $P$ in a unified framework. Other works have tended to focus on just one of these monads. Seeing them constructed and related in parallel provides more insight.- The paper mostly synthesizes and expands on known results, giving a comprehensive and self-contained treatment. The main novel contribution is the morphism of monads for supports. Overall it provides a solid reference for these monads and their relationships.In summary, the paper offers a thorough, categorical perspective on these monads encompassing both probabilistic and nondeterministic structure. Making precise the relationship between probability and nondeterminism via the support morphism is a valuable contribution.
