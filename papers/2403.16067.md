# [Robust Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16067)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models (DMs) have shown great promise for adversarial purification (AP), but recent work has shown that DMs themselves are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. 
- The diffusion process can destroy semantic information, generating high quality but unrecognizable images. This reduces classification accuracy.
- Fine-tuning DMs with adversarial training is computationally infeasible. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an adversarial guided diffusion model (AGDM) with a robust reverse process and adversarial guidance.
- The robust guidance is trained independently from the DM using an adversarial loss, avoiding expensive retraining. 
- The guidance encourages the reverse diffusion process to preserve semantic information and generate robust purified examples.

Key Contributions:
- First approach to provide DM-based AP with efficient adaptive ability to new attacks.
- Adversarial loss subtly bypasses high computational cost of applying adversarial training to DMs.
- Mitigates accuracy-robustness tradeoff in DM-based AP for the first time.
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness compared to latest AT and AP methods.
- Exhibits better generalization against unseen attacks.
- Empirical evaluation shows the necessity of robust guidance for DM-based adversarial purification.

In summary, this paper makes DM-based adversarial purification more practical by proposing an efficiently trainable robust guidance that encourages the reverse diffusion process to preserve semantics and resist adversarial attacks. This advances the state-of-the-art in accuracy, robustness and generalization ability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adversarial guided diffusion model for adversarial purification that employs a robust reverse process with adversarial guidance to improve the robustness of diffusion models against adversarial attacks while preserving semantic information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel adversarial guided diffusion model (AGDM) that employs a robust reverse process with adversarial guidance for given pre-trained diffusion models. This robust guidance is independent of the diffusion models and avoids retraining or fine-tuning them.

2) It proposes an adversarial loss to train the robust guidance, which subtly bypasses the high computational demand of applying adversarial training to diffusion models. This also provides a practical solution to mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off in diffusion model-based adversarial purification.

3) Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of diffusion model-based purifiers, especially under a new robust evaluation scheme. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among adversarial purification baselines and exhibits better robust generalization against unseen attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel robust reverse process with adversarial guidance for diffusion models to enhance their robustness for adversarial purification, while avoiding expensive retraining or fine-tuning of the models.

The paper proposes a novel robust reverse process with adversarial guidance for diffusion models to enhance their robustness against adversarial attacks, while also preserving semantic information and mitigating the accuracy-robustness trade-off. The key idea is to train a separate robust guidance model using an adversarial loss, and apply this guidance to modify the reverse process of a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more robust purified examples. The method is evaluated on image classification tasks using CIFAR datasets.

In summary, the key focus areas are robustness of diffusion models, adversarial purification, accuracy-robustness trade-off, and modified reverse process with adversarial guidance.
