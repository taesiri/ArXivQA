# [Tiny Titans: Can Smaller Large Language Models Punch Above Their Weight   in the Real World for Meeting Summarization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) show impressive capabilities for tasks like meeting summarization without requiring fine-tuning. However, deploying them in real-world systems has challenges like high computational costs.  
- Smaller LLMs require less resources but underperform compared to larger models even after fine-tuning. 

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct extensive experiments comparing smaller LLMs (less than 2B parameters) against larger pre-trained models (7B+ parameters) on meeting summarization.
- Evaluate on an in-domain business conversations dataset and a modified version of QMSUM academic dataset.
- Test with different instructions to generate long, medium and short summaries. 
- Analyze performance, cost efficiency and compute requirements.

Key Findings:
- Most smaller LLMs underperform compared to larger zero-shot models after fine-tuning. 
- FLAN-T5 with 780M parameters performs on par or even outperforms many larger models up to 70B parameters.
- FLAN-T5 inference is 3x faster than the 7B LLaMA-2 model.
- FLAN-T5 uses significantly fewer computational resources than larger models.

Main Conclusions:
- FLAN-T5 demonstrates capabilities comparable to much larger LLMs for meeting summarization while being highly efficient.
- It can generate quality summaries adhering to length instructions.
- FLAN-T5 provides a cost-effective solution for real-world LLM deployment.

Limitations:
- Only 3 instruction types tested. 
- GPT-4 generated summaries used as gold labels.
- Performance analyzed using transcript truncation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper extensively studies smaller and larger language models for meeting summarization, finding that the 780M parameter FLAN-T5 model fine-tuned with instructions performs comparably to much larger pre-trained models while being more suitable for real-world deployment due to lower computational requirements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It conducts an extensive evaluation of smaller language models (LLMs) with less than 2 billion parameters and compares their performance to larger LLMs with at least 7 billion parameters on meeting summarization tasks. 

2) It uses one real-world automatic speech recognition (ASR)-generated transcription dataset from business meetings and a modified version of the QMSUM dataset to ensure a fair evaluation and avoid potential data contamination issues.

3) It demonstrates the advantages of deploying smaller LLMs like FLAN-T5 for real-world usage based on an analysis of performance (accuracy and latency), inference cost, and computational resource requirements. 

4) The key finding is that the 780M parameter FLAN-T5 model, after fine-tuning, achieves comparable or even better performance than many larger zero-shot LLMs with 7B to over 70B parameters on meeting summarization tasks, while being much more compact and efficient. This makes it a suitable cost-efficient solution for real-world deployment.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive analysis showing that compact LLMs like FLAN-T5 can effectively mimic the performance of larger LLMs for meeting summarization while being more practical for real-world systems due to lower computational requirements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using smaller, compact language models like FLAN-T5 for real-world meeting summarization instead of larger models. What are the main advantages and potential limitations of using a smaller model like FLAN-T5?

2. The paper finds that fine-tuned FLAN-T5 performs significantly better than other smaller models on meeting summarization. What architectural properties or training methods allow FLAN-T5 to achieve strong performance despite its smaller size?

3. The paper argues that smaller models can help reduce costs for real-world deployment. Beyond computational costs, what other cost factors should be considered when choosing between small and large language models?  

4. The paper uses instruction tuning to train FLAN-T5 instead of traditional fine-tuning. How does instruction tuning work and why might it be advantageous for a compact model? What are its limitations?

5. The paper evaluates performance using varying summarization instructions (long, medium, short). Why is the ability to follow different instructions important for real-world usage? How could instruction following be improved?  

6. FLAN-T5 does not match larger models on the QMSUM dataset. The paper hypothesizes this is due to longer context. How could FLAN-T5 or other compact models be adapted to handle longer contexts?

7. The paper relies on GPT-4 generated summaries as references. What are the limitations of this evaluation approach? How could human annotation be incorporated?

8. What types of meetings or use cases might be better suited for a compact model like FLAN-T5 versus a larger model? When would you choose one over the other?

9. The paper focuses on extractive summarization. How could smaller generative models also be applied for abstractive summarization? What challenges might they face?

10. The paper studies meeting summarization specifically. To what extent could the findings generalize to other language generation tasks in real-world systems? What task characteristics are most relevant?
