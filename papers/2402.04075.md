# [Iterative Prompt Refinement for Radiation Oncology Symptom Extraction   Using Teacher-Student Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04075)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Extracting symptoms from clinical notes is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to lack of relevant training data and ineffective prompt engineering in specialized domains like radiation oncology. This limits the ability of LLMs to systematically abstract critical concepts from cancer-related texts.

Proposed Solution:  
- A novel teacher-student framework where the student LLM (Mixtral) extracts symptoms from notes and the teacher LLM (GPT-4) refines prompts to improve student's performance. This iterative process enhances symptom extraction accuracy.

- The teacher LLM receives the student's optimal prompt, peak performance, decision reasoning and failed prompt history as inputs to refine prompts over successive epochs and rounds until peak performance is achieved.

- Evaluated on 294 single symptom notes across 12 symptoms and 375 multi-symptom notes using accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.

Key Contributions:
- Automates prompt engineering for LLMs through teacher-student framework instead of manual tuning.
- Enables zero-shot learning, improving student LLM without additional training.  
- Allows local optimization of student LLM for privacy-preserving clinical concept extraction.
- Demonstrates systematic abstraction of key concepts from specialized cancer text.
- Achieves significant improvements in extracting symptoms from both single and multi-symptom clinical notes across all evaluation metrics.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative architecture for iterative prompt refinement using advanced LLMs to effectively extract symptoms from radiation oncology clinical notes while preserving privacy.
