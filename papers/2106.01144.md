# [Towards Emotional Support Dialog Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01144)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- How to design conversational agents/dialog systems capable of providing effective emotional support to users? 

- Can training dialog models on a corpus of emotional support conversations annotated with support strategies improve their ability to provide effective emotional support?

The authors propose an Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) framework grounded in counseling theories to characterize the stages and strategies of providing effective support. They then construct a dataset (ESConv) of emotional support dialogs annotated with support strategies. The authors train and evaluate various neural dialog models on this dataset to assess whether it can improve the models' ability to provide emotional support.

The main hypotheses seem to be:

1) The proposed ESC framework and ESConv dataset can be used to improve neural dialog models' ability to provide effective emotional support, as measured by both automatic metrics and human evaluations. 

2) Models trained on ESConv with support strategy labels will outperform models without those labels in providing emotional support.

In summary, the key focus is on developing conversational agents capable of emotional support by proposing an ESC framework, collecting a dataset grounded in this framework, and evaluating neural dialog models trained on this data. The central hypothesis is that this framework and dataset can improve models' emotional support capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the task of Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) for dialog systems, where the goal is to provide effective emotional support through conversation to help reduce a user's emotional distress. 

2. It presents an ESC Framework that characterizes the process of providing emotional support into three stages (Exploration, Comforting, Action), each with several recommended support strategies adapted from counseling theories.

3. It constructs a new dataset called ESConv for the ESC task, containing over 1,000 conversations between crowdworker supporters trained in emotional support skills and help-seekers. The conversations have rich annotations including support strategies, feedback scores, etc. Extensive effort is taken to ensure the conversations demonstrate effective emotional support.

4. It evaluates state-of-the-art dialog models on the ESC task using ESConv, showing the importance of incorporating support strategies. The best performing model can learn to mimic human supporters' strategy usage.

5. It helps advance research towards building dialog systems capable of providing emotional support by proposing the task and framework, releasing a dataset, and providing benchmark experiments. The framework, dataset, and analysis provide a foundation for future work on strategy selection, user state modeling, and evaluation for emotionally supportive dialog systems.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing the new ESC task, constructing the ESConv dataset, and providing empirical analysis that demonstrates the utility of the task and data towards building more emotionally supportive dialog systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Emotional Support Conversation framework and dataset to facilitate research on building dialog systems capable of providing effective emotional support through the use of conversational strategies.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on emotional support conversation compares to other related work:

- Scope: This paper focuses specifically on building dialog systems capable of providing emotional support through conversation. Other related work has looked at broader goals like building empathetic systems or conversational agents that can express emotion. Emotional support requires capabilities beyond just empathy or emotional expression.

- Task definition: The authors clearly define the task of emotional support conversation (ESC), including characterizing the aim, framework, and evaluation methodology. Other related work has not formally defined ESC as a distinct task.

- Framework: The paper proposes an ESC framework grounded in counseling research on support skills. This provides a principled approach tailored to dialog compared to prior work that does not draw on such theories.

- Dataset: The authors collect a new dataset called ESConv designed specifically for ESC research. Other datasets are not purpose-built, lack conversational depth, or do not ensure effective support is provided.

- Annotation: ESConv contains rich annotations including support strategies/skills used. This enables better training and evaluation. Other datasets lack these detailed annotations.

- Models: Experiments demonstrate ESConv's value for training models and incorporating strategy selection/generation. Prior work has not extensively explored model capabilities for providing conversational support.

In summary, this paper establishes emotional support conversation as a distinct task, proposes a theoretically grounded framework, introduces a high-quality dataset, and uses it to advance model capabilities in this complex dialog domain. The formal task definition and constructed resources help strengthen this emerging research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Further research into strategy selection and realization - The authors note that an important sub-problem of ESC is support strategy selection and strategy-constrained response generation. They suggest further research could focus on how to select strategies appropriately based on context and how to generate responses that conform to a specified strategy.

- User state modeling - The authors suggest it is important to model and track the user's emotional state dynamically, to inform both dynamic strategy selection and evaluating the effectiveness of emotional support. This is noted as an area for future work.

- Evaluation of support effectiveness - The authors note that ESC introduces a new dimension of evaluating whether emotional support is actually effective, beyond just relevance and coherence. Developing evaluation methods for support effectiveness is suggested as an area for research. 

- Exploration of other conversation settings - The authors developed the ESC framework grounded in peer/social support conversations, but suggest the framework could be explored for other scenarios like customer service chats where emotional support plays a role.

- Multimodal emotion recognition - The paper focuses on textual conversations, but the authors suggest multimodal emotion recognition could be incorporated in future work to better perceive and respond to user emotional states.

- Long-term user state modeling - The authors collected single dialogs showing emotion improvement, but suggest longer-term modeling of user emotional state across dialog sessions could be an interesting direction.

- Personalized support profiles - The paper focuses on generalized support, but the authors suggest personalizing strategy selection and support responses based on individual user's preferences could be explored.

In summary, the key future directions highlighted are improving strategy use, user state modeling, evaluating support effectiveness, and exploring extensions to other tasks, modalities and timescales. The authors lay important groundwork and suggest many interesting ways to advance research in emotional support dialogue systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes the task of Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) and an ESC Framework grounded in the Helping Skills Theory. The framework characterizes ESC into three stages (Exploration, Comforting, and Action) and suggests support strategies for each stage. To facilitate research on ESC, the authors construct a dataset called ESConv which contains conversations between crowdworker supporters trained in the ESC Framework and help-seekers. The conversations are annotated with support strategies and other information like the help-seekers' emotion intensity ratings. Experiments show that models fine-tuned on ESConv provide more effective emotional support compared to generic conversational models, demonstrating the utility of the dataset. The paper concludes that ESConv and the ESC task can enable further research into building dialog systems capable of providing emotional support.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a framework and dataset for emotional support conversations (ESC). The authors propose an ESC framework that is grounded in counseling theories and consists of three stages - exploration, comforting, and action. Each stage involves the use of certain conversational strategies like asking questions, reflecting feelings, and providing suggestions. The authors then construct a dataset called ESConv which contains over 1,000 emotional support dialogues between crowdworker supporters and help-seekers. The conversations follow the ESC framework and supporters' utterances are annotated with the strategies used. Multiple mechanisms like training tutorials and qualification tests are used to ensure high-quality conversations with effective emotional support. Experiments show that models fine-tuned on this dataset are better at providing emotional support compared to baseline models like BlenderBot. The human evaluation also demonstrates that models can learn to mimic human supporters' strategy usage for more effective emotional support.

In summary, this paper makes two main contributions - an ESC framework adapted from counseling theories to guide emotional support conversations, and a high-quality dataset of annotated emotional support dialogues. Experiments demonstrate the utility of the dataset for training models to provide better emotional support by following the strategies laid out in the framework. The work provides a strong foundation to advance research and development of dialog systems capable of providing emotional support to users.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are the key problems/questions it is addressing:

- How to design dialog systems that can provide effective emotional support in conversations, which is important for many applications like mental health support, social interactions, and customer service.

- Previous work on emotional/empathetic dialog systems has limitations in functionality since they focus on just expressing emotions or empathy. Providing effective emotional support requires additional skills like exploring the user's problems, providing comfort, and suggesting solutions. 

- There is a lack of well-designed tasks and datasets that provide good examples of skills and strategies humans use to give emotional support in conversations. This makes it difficult to train data-driven models for emotional support dialog systems.

- Can grounding an emotional support conversation framework in psychology theory and collecting a dataset following this framework improve dialog models' ability to provide emotional support?

- What conversational strategies are most effective for providing emotional support at different stages of a conversation? How can models learn when to use different strategies?

- How can the effectiveness of emotional support in conversations be evaluated, beyond just relevance and coherence?

In summary, the key focus is on designing a task and dataset to research and develop dialog systems that can effectively provide emotional support during conversations, in order to address limitations of prior work in this direction.
