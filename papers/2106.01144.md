# Towards Emotional Support Dialog Systems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:- How to design conversational agents/dialog systems capable of providing effective emotional support to users? - Can training dialog models on a corpus of emotional support conversations annotated with support strategies improve their ability to provide effective emotional support?The authors propose an Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) framework grounded in counseling theories to characterize the stages and strategies of providing effective support. They then construct a dataset (ESConv) of emotional support dialogs annotated with support strategies. The authors train and evaluate various neural dialog models on this dataset to assess whether it can improve the models' ability to provide emotional support.The main hypotheses seem to be:1) The proposed ESC framework and ESConv dataset can be used to improve neural dialog models' ability to provide effective emotional support, as measured by both automatic metrics and human evaluations. 2) Models trained on ESConv with support strategy labels will outperform models without those labels in providing emotional support.In summary, the key focus is on developing conversational agents capable of emotional support by proposing an ESC framework, collecting a dataset grounded in this framework, and evaluating neural dialog models trained on this data. The central hypothesis is that this framework and dataset can improve models' emotional support capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes the task of Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) for dialog systems, where the goal is to provide effective emotional support through conversation to help reduce a user's emotional distress. 2. It presents an ESC Framework that characterizes the process of providing emotional support into three stages (Exploration, Comforting, Action), each with several recommended support strategies adapted from counseling theories.3. It constructs a new dataset called ESConv for the ESC task, containing over 1,000 conversations between crowdworker supporters trained in emotional support skills and help-seekers. The conversations have rich annotations including support strategies, feedback scores, etc. Extensive effort is taken to ensure the conversations demonstrate effective emotional support.4. It evaluates state-of-the-art dialog models on the ESC task using ESConv, showing the importance of incorporating support strategies. The best performing model can learn to mimic human supporters' strategy usage.5. It helps advance research towards building dialog systems capable of providing emotional support by proposing the task and framework, releasing a dataset, and providing benchmark experiments. The framework, dataset, and analysis provide a foundation for future work on strategy selection, user state modeling, and evaluation for emotionally supportive dialog systems.In summary, the key contributions are proposing the new ESC task, constructing the ESConv dataset, and providing empirical analysis that demonstrates the utility of the task and data towards building more emotionally supportive dialog systems.
