# [Neural Volume Rendering: NeRF And Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05204)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can neural volume rendering techniques like NeRF be improved upon in terms of performance, handling dynamic scenes, relighting capabilities, incorporating shape priors, and scene composition? 

The authors provide a broad overview of the explosion of NeRF-style papers in 2020, summarizing the key innovations and limitations of the original NeRF approach. They highlight research directions such as:

- Improving the speed of training and rendering (JaxNeRF, AutoInt, etc.)

- Extending to dynamic scenes (Nerfies, D-NeRF, NSFF, etc.)

- Incorporating shape priors through latent codes (pixelNeRF, GRF, GRAF, pi-GAN)

- Scene composition of multiple objects or models (OSF, GIRAFFE, Neural Scene Graphs)

So in summary, the central research direction is pushing the boundaries of neural volume rendering to address limitations of the original NeRF method by improving performance, generalizing to new scenes and objects, handling dynamics, relighting, and complex scene composition. The paper seems aimed at providing an overview of these research frontiers in 2020 following the initial NeRF explosion.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can neural volume rendering methods like NeRF be improved upon in terms of performance, modeling of dynamic scenes, relighting capabilities, encoding geometric priors, and scene composition? 

The authors present an annotated bibliography reviewing the rapid explosion of follow-up work after the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) paper that aim to address limitations of the original NeRF approach.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this NeRF survey paper compares to other research in neural rendering:

- Scope: This paper provides a broad overview of the explosion of NeRF papers in 2020, categorizing and summarizing key innovations. Other papers tend to focus in more depth on a specific method.

- Purpose: The goal here is to serve as an annotated bibliography to help researchers get up to speed on recent progress. Other papers aim to introduce a novel method or analyze/compare methods empirically.

- Structure: The paper is organized thematically and chronologically, highlighting connections between concurrent work. Most research papers are structured around introducing and evaluating a new technique. 

- Discussion: Unique to a survey, this paper synthesizes trends and offers conjectures on future directions. Individual papers focus on technical description rather than big-picture analysis.

- Data: There is no new data or experiments here. Research papers demonstrate results on standard datasets or new captures. 

- Completeness: With ~25 papers covered in 6 months, there are bound to be some missing. But this rapid publication shows the value of preprints.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces neural radiance fields (NeRF), a novel scene representation for view synthesis. NeRF represents a static 3D scene as a continuous 5D function - mapping 3D coordinates and 2D viewing direction to density and RGB color. This function is encoded as a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. To render a novel view, rays are cast from the camera into the scene and the radiance along each ray is estimated by querying the MLP at sampled points and numerically integrating the density and color. The MLP is trained on a dataset of posed images by optimizing for rendered images to match input views. NeRF synthesizes high quality novel views of complex scenes by representing geometry and appearance with a single MLP network.
