# [Neural Volume Rendering: NeRF And Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05204)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can neural volume rendering techniques like NeRF be improved upon in terms of performance, handling dynamic scenes, relighting capabilities, incorporating shape priors, and scene composition? 

The authors provide a broad overview of the explosion of NeRF-style papers in 2020, summarizing the key innovations and limitations of the original NeRF approach. They highlight research directions such as:

- Improving the speed of training and rendering (JaxNeRF, AutoInt, etc.)

- Extending to dynamic scenes (Nerfies, D-NeRF, NSFF, etc.)

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces neural radiance fields (NeRF), a novel scene representation for view synthesis. NeRF represents a static 3D scene as a continuous 5D function - mapping 3D coordinates and 2D viewing direction to density and RGB color. This function is encoded as a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. To render a novel view, rays are cast from the camera into the scene and the radiance along each ray is estimated by querying the MLP at sampled points and numerically integrating the density and color. The MLP is trained on a dataset of posed images by optimizing for rendered images to match input views. NeRF synthesizes high quality novel views of complex scenes by representing geometry and appearance with a single MLP network.
