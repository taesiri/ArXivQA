## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel twin support vector regression model that incorporates privileged information (TSVR+) to improve predictive performance. Privileged information refers to additional descriptive attributes that are only available during model training. The proposed TSVR+ integrates privileged information into the twin support vector regression framework to construct two non-parallel proximal functions. It solves two quadratic programming problems, each subjected to one set of constraints. The model considers structural risk minimization by adding regularization terms to prevent overfitting. For efficient training, the successive over-relaxation technique is employed to solve the optimizations. Experiments conducted on various regression datasets demonstrate superior performance of TSVR+ over other baseline and state-of-the-art twin support vector regression models like standard TSVR, Îµ-TSVR, TWSVR and TSVQR. The average ranks and statistical tests show significantly improved RMSE values, explaining variance, and computational efficiency. Overall, the integration of privileged information successfully boosts the generalization capability and predictive accuracy of the twin support vector regression model.
