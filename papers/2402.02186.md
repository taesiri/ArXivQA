## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful generative models that can sample diverse and high-reward compositional objects like molecules and combinatorial graphs. However, GFlowNets struggle with temporal credit assignment over long trajectories and sparse rewards, which is common in real-world tasks like drug design. This makes GFlowNets training unstable and limits their applicability.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Evolution Guided Generative Flow Networks (EGFN) which combines GFlowNets with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to address the challenges of long trajectories and sparse rewards. 

The key ideas are:
(1) Use an EA population to generate high-reward trajectories which are stored in a prioritized replay buffer (PRB). The EA naturally handles long horizons and sparse rewards.
(2) Sample trajectories from the PRB to train the GFlowNet agent using gradient descent, alongside online samples. This provides better gradients.
(3) The high-reward trajectories bias the GFlowNet sampling towards promising regions. The PRB provides sample redundancy for stable training.

Together this allows EGFN to leverage the strengths of both EA and GFlowNets - long-term credit assignment from EA and matched reward distribution modeling from GFlowNets.

Contributions:
(1) A novel method to combine EA and GFlowNets to address a key weakness of GFlowNets.
(2) Thorough investigation over synthetic tasks and real-world molecule generation tasks demonstrating clear and consistent improvements over GFlowNets.
(3) Ablation studies validate the importance of different components like mutation and PRB.
(4) Analysis provides insights into why EGFN works better than GFlowNets.

In summary, the paper makes a simple but impactful augmentation to GFlowNets using EA that unlocks much better performance on hard real-world problems involving long trajectories and sparse rewards.
