# [On Formally Undecidable Traits of Intelligent Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers the problem of formally proving properties (called "traits") of intelligent machines, such as whether a machine is intelligent, moral, or contained (not harmful). 

- Prior work by Alfonseca et al. claimed it was impossible to formally prove these traits for arbitrary intelligent machines by appealing to Rice's theorem from computability theory. 

- However, the authors argue that Rice's theorem does not apply in this context, since traits like intelligence plausibly depend on efficiency and are therefore "syntactic" rather than purely "semantic".

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a formal framework based on Turing machines to precisely define machine traits. 

- They show that many realistic traits are "resource-bounded" by measures like time efficiency. Resource-bounded traits are syntactic according to their framework.

- For syntactic traits, the authors prove a version of Rice's theorem showing only traits with an infinite syntactic part can be formally decidable.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates flaws in prior claims about the formal undecidability of traits like intelligence and morality in machines.

- Provides formal definitions and proofs about machine traits, highlighting the importance of efficiency considerations.

- Shows that traits are formally decidable only if infinite algorithms satisfy the syntactic constraints, suggesting the need for further research to characterize key traits like intelligence.

In summary, the paper overturns previous beliefs about the formal limitations on proving machine traits, while also exposing open questions that need to be resolved to make such proofs possible. Formalizing notions like efficiency is critical for progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a formal framework to analyze the logical possibility of proving that arbitrary artificially intelligent machines possess desired traits like intelligence, morality, and containment, finding that contrary to some prior claims, Rice's theorem does not generally forbid proving machines have such traits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is formally developing a framework to analyze the logical possibility of proving that arbitrary artificially intelligent machines possess certain desirable traits, such as being intelligent, contained, moral, etc. Specifically:

- The paper introduces the concept of "traits" of Turing machines, which are sets of Turing machines possessing some property. It shows that a version of Rice's theorem applies to "nontrivial" and "semantic" traits, making them undecidable.

- However, traits like "intelligent machines" or "moral machines" are argued to likely be "syntactic" rather than semantic, meaning Rice's theorem does not directly apply. 

- For syntactic traits with a nonempty semantic part and a finite, nonzero syntactic part, the paper proves they are undecidable.

- This is then applied to argue that traits like "intelligent machines", "contained machines", and "moral machines" may fall into this category, making them potentially undecidable.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing a formal framework to precisely state and prove results about the logical limitations around proving machines possess certain desirable properties, focusing especially on traits relevant to AI safety. A key result is that commonly desired traits like intelligence and morality may be undecidable, contrary to previous arguments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms are:

- Computability theory
- Turing machines
- Rice's theorem 
- Machine intelligence 
- Intelligent machines
- Desired traits
- Contained machines
- Moral machines 
- Superintelligent machines
- Decidability of traits
- Semantic traits
- Syntactic traits

The paper develops a formal framework based on computability theory and Turing machines to analyze the decidability of various traits of intelligent machines, such as whether they are contained, moral, or superintelligent. Concepts from Rice's theorem are extended to determine if and when it's possible to prove that an arbitrary intelligent machine possesses certain desirable traits. Notions of semantic versus syntactic traits are introduced and play an important role. Overall, the formal analysis sheds light on the fundamental logical limitations in determining key properties of intelligent machines.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that intelligence is not necessarily a semantic trait of machines because efficiency seems to be an important factor. However, couldn't one argue that efficiency is just a syntactic property - it does not change what function the machine computes, just how fast it computes it? Why or why not?

2. The paper defines "contained machines" partly by saying their computations do not reveal classified information. But doesn't any universal machine effectively reveal all computations by being able to simulate them? How might the definitions be altered to avoid this issue?  

3. What are some examples of properties of machines that seem clearly semantic? The paper discusses intelligence and morality as potentially syntactic, but are there traits that avoid this ambiguity?

4. The paper suggests cooperation algorithms could form the basis for moral machines. However, couldn't an adversarial agent exploit cooperation for negative ends? How might cooperation algorithms need to be constrained or augmented to avoid this failure mode?  

5. If intelligence and morality are time-bounded syntactic traits as conjectured, what are the implications for attempts to ensure safe and beneficial AI systems? Does this make the control problem substantially easier or harder?

6. What philosophical assumptions underlie the Argument for why superintelligent machines are likely possible if AGIs exist? How plausible are these assumptions and what evidence supports them? 

7. The paper suggests general intelligence may involve efficiency and speed on intellectual tasks, not just behavioral output. But what about slow deliberative processes also being a hallmark of intelligence? Is the definition perhaps too narrow?  

8. What other desired traits beyond containment, morality and superintelligence seem important for aligning intelligent machines? What are some formalizations of these that avoid being purely semantic?

9. The paper suggests the "easy problem of desires" may be solved by a finite list. But humans seem to have an infinite range of preferences - how could any finite list capture all of them? What is an example of a finite yet useful list?

10. If the syntactic part of a trait like intelligence has finite non-zero size, does this mean there could exist a formal system that captures intelligence, even if not decidable? What would such a system look like?
