# [Blockchain-enabled Trustworthy Federated Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing federated unlearning frameworks require the central server to retain historical model parameters from clients, allowing the server to potentially use these parameters for further training without permission after clients exit. This compromises client data ownership. Moreover, determining the optimal number of unlearning rounds to minimize overhead is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a blockchain-enabled federated unlearning framework to address these issues. The key ideas are:

1) A blockchain component handles unlearning requests and stores model update hashes to ensure transparency, while an off-chain component handles actual model training/unlearning. 

2) A "proof of federated unlearning" protocol based on Chameleon hash functions verifies data removal and eliminates client data effects in other clients' models. It enables changing parameters without altering hashes to ensure security. 

3) An adaptive contribution-based retraining mechanism reduces overhead by estimating each target client's contribution using historical model updates and the correlation between local and global gradients. This determines the optimal global unlearning rounds.

Main Contributions:
1) A blockchain framework to securely handle continuous unlearning requests and verify data removal in a decentralized manner.

2) A proof of federated unlearning protocol using Chameleon hashes to fully erase target client model updates and data effects, addressing client data ownership.

3) An adaptive retraining mechanism to estimate target client contributions for determining optimal unlearning rounds, reducing overhead.

Experiments demonstrate superior unlearning effectiveness and efficiency over state-of-the-art approaches. The framework marks significant progress towards trustworthy and practical federated unlearning.
