# [Incorporating Riemannian Geometric Features for Learning Coefficient of   Pressure Distributions on Airplane Wings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09452)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately predicting the coefficient of pressure (Cp) distributions on airplane wings is challenging, especially at high angles of attack. 
- Traditional polynomial-based shape representations struggle to capture the full 3D geometry of wings.
- Existing deep learning methods take 2D slices/images as input, losing 3D shape information.

Proposed Solution:
- Approximate the 3D wing surface using a set of self-intersection-free Bézier surfaces to form a Riemannian manifold.
- Extract three Riemannian geometric features from the manifold at each point and its 8 neighbors: Riemannian metric, connection, and curvature. These capture local 3D shape.
- Input flight conditions, coordinate points, and geometric features into a multi-feature deep learning model to predict Cp distributions. 

Contributions:
- Novel way to represent 3D wing geometry using Riemannian manifolds and geometric features.
- Incorporates local 3D shape information from a point and its neighbors, unlike 2D slice methods.
- Reduces average Cp prediction error by 8.41% on a public dataset compared to state-of-the-art, especially at high angles of attack.
- Demonstrates the benefits of using Riemannian geometric features compared to images for learning wing aerodynamics.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage differential geometry concepts to better represent 3D shape information to improve Cp prediction accuracy over existing deep learning approaches that use 2D wing images. The multi-feature model also helps integrate geometric and flight parameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to predict the coefficient of pressure (C_P) distributions on airplane wings by incorporating Riemannian geometric features extracted from a piecewise smooth manifold approximating the wing surface into a deep learning model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a method to represent the geometry of an aircraft wing in 3D space using a set of self-intersection-free Bézier surfaces to form a piecewise smooth manifold. 

2. They demonstrate that geometric features like Riemannian metric, connection, and curvature can be calculated from this manifold to represent the geometric structure of the 3D aircraft wing.

3. They incorporate these geometric features along with flight conditions and coordinate points into a multi-feature deep learning model to predict the coefficient of pressure ($C_P$) distributions on the wing surface. 

4. Their method reduces the mean squared error of $C_P$ predictions by an average of 8.41% on the DLR-F11 aircraft test set compared to state-of-the-art methods like Deep Attention Networks.

In summary, the key contribution is using Riemannian geometric features to represent 3D aircraft wing geometry and incorporating these along with other inputs into a deep learning model to improve $C_P$ prediction accuracy over existing methods.
