# [VideoRF: Rendering Dynamic Radiance Fields as 2D Feature Video Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Rendering dynamic radiance fields representing free-viewpoint videos in real-time on mobile devices remains challenging due to the data storage and computational constraints. Existing methods either struggle with long sequences, large motions, topological changes or rely on canonical spaces. Recent approaches focus on model compression but still face difficulties in enabling real-time decoding and rendering on mobile platforms.  

Proposed Solution - VideoRF:
The paper proposes VideoRF, a novel approach to enable real-time streaming and rendering of dynamic radiance fields on mobile devices. The key ideas are:

1) Serialize the 4D radiance field into a 2D feature image stream compatible with video codec hardware by storing scene properties like density and appearance features. 

2) Propose an efficient rendering pipeline involving mapping tables for O(1) density/feature lookup and deferred shading model to leverage shader rendering.

3) Introduce a training scheme with adaptive grouping of frames, 3D-2D Morton sorting and spatial-temporal consistency losses directly applied on 2D feature images to induce sparsity for efficient video encoding.

Main Contributions:

1) VideoRF representation and rendering pipeline enabling real-time decoding and rendering of dynamic scenes on mobiles via video codec and shader optimization.

2) Codec-tailored training technique to serialize the 4D field into a redundant 2D feature stream maintaining spatial-temporal consistency.

3) Interactive cross-platform player supporting seamless streaming, drag, rotate, play, seek, etc. across devices like phones, tablets and desktops.

Overall, VideoRF allows users to experience high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of long dynamic sequences in real-time on mobile devices for the first time, offering an interactive viewing experience similar to watching online videos.
