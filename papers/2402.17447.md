# [Deep Learning Based Named Entity Recognition Models for Recipes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Named entity recognition (NER) is crucial for extracting information from food and recipe texts for applications like disease prediction, cost analysis, flavor profiling etc. However, NER models require large annotated datasets which are lacking in the food and recipes domain.  

- Existing works have limitations such as dependency on external resources (FoodIE), small datasets (few thousand samples) or are rule-based and do not leverage recent advances with deep learning models.

Proposed Solution:
- Created an augmented dataset with 26,445 ingredient phrases using label-wise token replacement, synonym replacement and token shuffling within segments.  

- Developed a machine annotated dataset with 88,526 phrases using a novel stratified entity frequency sampling technique on 349,762 unique ingredient phrases from RecipeDB. This ensures diversity and represents the breadth of recipes.

- Implemented and evaluated statistical (CRF), transformer based (BERT, RoBERTa etc.) and other deep learning models (spaCy, Flair) for NER on recipes using the augmented datasets. 

Key Contributions:  
- Introduced augmented (26k phrases) and extensive machine annotated (88k phrases) datasets for recipe NER

- Performed comprehensive evaluation of statistical and deep learning models. spaCy-transformer emerges best with macro F1 scores of 95.9%, 96% and 95.7% on manually annotated, augmented and machine annotated datasets.

- Analysis reveals lower sample sizes for certain entity types (eg. temperature) causes inferior performance. Data augmentation and increased dataset diversity helps improve model performance.

- Established deep learning models outperform statistical methods (CRF) for recipe NER task. Performance is further boosted by data augmentation strategies proposed.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through data curation, application of advanced deep learning models and extensive experimentation to push state-of-the-art for named entity recognition in the recipes domain.
