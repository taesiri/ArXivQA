# [Neural Prompt Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04673)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we automatically search for the optimal design of prompt modules to efficiently tune large vision models for downstream tasks?

Specifically, the paper proposes a neural architecture search based approach called NOAH to find the best combination and configuration of different prompt modules like adapters, LoRA, and visual prompt tuning. The goal is to avoid hand-engineering prompt modules for each new dataset and instead learn the optimal prompt design directly from data in an automated way.

The main hypothesis appears to be that searching over different prompt modules and their hyperparameters can discover designs that outperform individual prompt tuning methods applied in isolation. The experiments aim to validate whether NOAH can achieve superior performance compared to hand-tuning adapters, LoRA, or visual prompts.

In summary, the core research problem is automating prompt module design through neural architecture search in order to achieve better efficiency and performance when adapting large vision models to new datasets. The main hypothesis is that neural prompt search can outperform individual prompt tuning techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a novel approach called Neural Prompt Search (NOAH) for large vision models, which automatically searches for the optimal combination of prompt modules (Adapter, LoRA, and VPT) for each downstream dataset through neural architecture search. 

- It conducts extensive experiments on the VTAB-1k benchmark (19 vision datasets) and shows that NOAH outperforms individual prompt modules on most datasets. NOAH also demonstrates superior few-shot learning ability and robustness to domain shifts.

- The paper provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of the architectures found by NOAH for different datasets. The results show the subnets exhibit diverse patterns, justifying the need for search rather than hand-engineering prompt modules.

- More broadly, this work is the first attempt to address the challenge of designing parameter-efficient tuning methods for large vision models from the neural architecture search perspective. The results validate the potential of using NAS to automate the process of finding optimal prompt modules.

In summary, the key insight is to view existing prompt modules as building blocks and automatically combine them in an optimal way via NAS for each downstream dataset. This removes the need for tedious manual search over architectures and hyper-parameters when applying these modules. The approach and results open up new research directions on efficient transfer learning for large pre-trained models.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Apply the neural prompt search approach to natural language processing (NLP) tasks in addition to computer vision. The paper currently focuses on vision models, but the authors state they plan to apply the method to NLP in the future.

- Dig deeper into the mechanisms behind why the neural prompt search approach works well in order to better interpret the results. The paper exposes some intriguing results and patterns in how the different prompt modules are combined, so further analysis could provide more insight.

- Explore more advanced designs for the prompt modules themselves. The paper finds that different prompt modules work best for features at different levels in the network. This suggests further research could develop improved prompt module architectures. 

- Apply the neural prompt search approach to broader application domains beyond computer vision. The current results are demonstrated on image classification tasks, so expanding to other vision applications like object detection, segmentation, etc. could be worthwhile.

- Reduce the additional training cost required for the supernet in the neural prompt search method. The authors acknowledge the supernet training increases development costs, so reducing this could make the approach more efficient.

- Evaluate the approach with limited training data. The results show the benefits of the method increase when more training data is available, so adapting it to succeed in extremely low data regimes could be useful.

In summary, the main future directions are applying the approach to NLP and other applications, analyzing the results deeper, improving the prompt modules, and increasing the efficiency and low-data capabilities. The core idea of automatically searching for the best prompt combination is promising and can likely be advanced further.

The key idea is to view existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like Adapter, LoRA, and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) as "prompt modules" and incorporate them into a search space. A ViT-like supernet is constructed where each Transformer block can contain an Adapter module, a LoRA module, and a VPT module.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to efficiently fine-tune large pre-trained vision models on downstream tasks. Specifically, it focuses on comparing and improving parameter-efficient tuning methods like adapters, LoRA, and visual prompt tuning.
