# [JMA: a General Algorithm to Craft Nearly Optimal Targeted Adversarial   Example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01199)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing adversarial attack algorithms for deep neural networks (DNNs) are designed for classifiers based on one-hot encoding output. They focus on increasing the softmax probability or logit of the target class, while ignoring the impact on other outputs. This greedy approach is suboptimal for networks with different output encoding schemes like error-correcting output codes (ECOC) or multi-label classification. Crafting adversarial examples for such models is challenging as the outputs are correlated in a complex way. There is a need for more general and optimal adversarial attacks that work across different network architectures and output encodings.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new targeted attack called Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance Attack (JMA). It solves the original formulation by Szegedy et al. of minimizing the adversarial perturbation subject to misclassification as the target class. Under a first-order approximation of the DNN, this constrained optimization is reduced to minimizing the Mahalanobis distance between the current network output and target output. The distance metric uses the Jacobian matrix to account for the differing efforts (in input space) of moving the output in various directions. By applying Wolfe duality theory, the problem simplifies down to a non-negative least squares (NNLS) problem that can be efficiently solved. The optimal perturbation distorts the input image to move its output representation towards the closest point in the target class region.  

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of a general, sound, targeted attack using Jacobian-based Mahalanobis distance to replace greedier loss minimization 
- Reduction to an NNLS problem for efficient numerical solution
- Validation across DNNs with different output encodings like ECOC, multi-label classification along with standard one-hot 
- Consistently improved attack success rate, lower distortion and complexity over state-of-the-art methods
- Significantly enhanced multi-label attack capability of simultaneously flipping multiple output bits
- Addressing an open challenge of crafting optimal attacks for non-standard output encodings

In summary, the paper proposes a theoretically optimal adversarial attack that outperforms current methods across diverse network architectures in terms of attack effectiveness and efficiency. It enables much more powerful multi-label attacks by holistically optimizing over all output scores.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new targeted adversarial attack method called Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance Attack (JMA) that solves the original adversarial attack problem formulation under a first order approximation and outperforms existing attacks in terms of efficiency, distortion, and success rate for classifiers with different output encoding schemes including error correction output coding and multi-label classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of a new targeted adversarial attack called Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance Attack (JMA). The attack minimizes a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term to find the optimal perturbation that moves the input sample's representation to a target point.

2. Solving the constrained minimization problem by exploiting Wolfe duality theorem and reducing it to a non-negative least square (NNLS) problem that can be efficiently solved numerically. 

3. Validation of the attack on different datasets and networks with various output encoding schemes like error correction output coding (ECOC), multi-label classification, and one-hot encoding. Experiments show the attack is very general, efficient, and achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

4. In multi-label classification, the attack can simultaneously change up to half the labels even when the number of labels is large (e.g. 20). This capability is beyond other existing attacks.

5. The attack remains effective in one-hot encoding case with much lower complexity than Carlini & Wagner attack.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and validation of the JMA attack, which is a general, efficient, and high-performing targeted adversarial attack applicable to various network architectures and output encoding schemes.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Adversarial examples - Quasi-imperceptible perturbations to inputs that can cause deep learning models to make incorrect predictions. The paper focuses on crafting targeted adversarial examples.

- Targeted attack - An attack where the adversarial example is crafted to be misclassified as a specific target class chosen by the attacker.

- Jacobian matrix - The matrix of partial derivatives of the network function with respect to the input. Used in the paper's attack formulation.  

- Mahalanobis distance - A distance metric that accounts for correlations between variables. Used to define the attack objective function.

- Non-negative least squares (NNLS) - An optimization problem for finding the minimum norm solution to an overdetermined system. Solved to generate the adversarial perturbation.

- Error correction output coding (ECOC) - An output encoding scheme using channel codewords rather than one-hot vectors. One of the attack settings evaluated.

- Multi-label classification - Classifiers that predict multiple labels for each input. Another attack scenario evaluated.

- Attack success rate (ASR) - Percentage of attacks that succeeded in misclassifying to the target. Used as an evaluation metric.

- Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) - Metric to characterize distortion between original and attacked images.

So in summary, key terms cover the adversarial attack formulation, attack scenarios, underlying optimization problem, and evaluation metrics.
