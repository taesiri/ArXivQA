# [AvatarStudio: High-fidelity and Animatable 3D Avatar Creation from Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17917)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes AvatarStudio, a novel framework for creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D avatars from only text inputs. The key innovation is an articulated 3D representation that combines a NeRF-based model for coarse shape generation with an explicit textured mesh model for detailed avatar modeling and animation. Specifically, AvatarStudio first optimizes a low-resolution NeRF model to capture the overall geometry. This representation is then converted into an explicit mesh and further refined using a DensePose-conditioned diffusion model as guidance. To enable animation, AvatarStudio incorporates SMPL-based articulation that allows deforming the avatar to arbitrary poses. Compared to prior work, AvatarStudio generates significantly higher quality and more detailed avatars which can also be easily animated via video or text prompts. The paper demonstrates a wide range of avatar creation results, verifies the approach through quantitative evaluation, analyzes each component through ablation studies, and showcases applications like multimodal animation and style-guided generation. Limitations include efficiency, facial animation capability, and occasional hand artifacts. Overall, AvatarStudio sets a new state-of-the-art for text-to-avatar generation through innovations in representation learning and diffusion guidance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new framework called "AvatarStudio" for creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D avatars from only text inputs. Specifically:

1) It proposes a new 3D human representation that incorporates articulated human modeling into an explicit mesh representation. This enables animation of the generated avatars while allowing high-resolution rendering for quality avatar creation.

2) It introduces the use of a DensePose-conditioned diffusion model for Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) supervision during the optimization process. This ensures more stable and view-consistent avatar creation with accurate pose control compared to using other conditional signals. 

3) It discovers several effective strategies like part-aware super-resolution, dual-space training, and CFG rescaling to facilitate avatar generation. These enhance both the quality and detail of the final results.

4) Thanks to the incorporated articulation modeling and the above contributions, the proposed "AvatarStudio" system can generate high-fidelity, animatable avatars from text. It also supports downstream applications like multimodal avatar animation and style-guided avatar creation.

In summary, the core contribution lies in the proposed "AvatarStudio" system and its capability to create quality animatable avatars from text through an articulated modeling approach guided by innovations like DensePose-conditioned SDS.
