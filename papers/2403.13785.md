# [Towards an extension of Fault Trees in the Predictive Maintenance   Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13785)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predictive maintenance is an important application of AI and IoT in critical systems to improve reliability. Both model-based and data-driven approaches have limitations - model-based lacks flexibility/adaptability and data-driven lacks transparency and explainability.  

- There is a need to combine the strengths of both approaches for predictive maintenance of critical systems like railways.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a new modeling language called Predictive Fault Trees (PdFT) to model failure behaviors and dynamics. 

- PdFT extends traditional Fault Trees to incorporate concepts like system dynamics, conditional failures based on dynamics, probabilistic failures, repair models. This improves expressiveness to model complex behaviors.

- The paper also proposes an integrated model-based and data-driven approach for building and analyzing PdFT models. The modeler first creates a model template identifying known and unknown parts.

- Various data-driven techniques like time series analysis, association rule mining and process mining are then used to discover failure patterns, repair patterns, conditional failures etc. from data. These are used to build the complete PdFT model.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of PdFT language to incorporate dynamics and rich failure behaviors compared to traditional Fault Trees

- Outlining a model template based approach to integrate model-based and data-driven techniques for predictive maintenance

- Identification of different data mining techniques to discover useful knowledge from data to build and refine PdFT models

In summary, the paper introduces PdFT modeling language and an integrated methodology combining model-based and data-driven approaches to address limitations of using them independently for predictive maintenance of critical systems.
