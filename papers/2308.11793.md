# [Enhancing NeRF akin to Enhancing LLMs: Generalizable NeRF Transformer   with Mixture-of-View-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is on developing a generalizable neural radiance field (NeRF) model that can synthesize novel views of unseen scenes without requiring per-scene optimization. The key hypothesis is that incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module into the NeRF architecture can help balance between generalization across diverse scenes and specialization for modeling individual scenes closely. Specifically, the paper proposes a model called GNT-MOVE, which augments the Generalizable NeRF Transformer (GNT) architecture with customized MoE modules. The goal is to leverage the flexibility and increased capacity of MoE to improve the generalization of GNT to novel scenes in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.The two main research questions addressed are:1) Does incorporating MoE help the GNT model scale up in terms of scene coverage and improve generalizability across diverse scenes?2) Can GNT-MOVE achieve better per-scene specialization compared to GNT by using the MoE to capture nuances of distinct scenes?To summarize, the central hypothesis is that a properly customized MoE-based architecture can enhance NeRF's capability for cross-scene generalization while retaining per-scene specialization. The paper evaluates this through extensive experiments on complex scene datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a Generalizable NeRF Transformer with Mixture-of-View-Experts (GNT-MOVE) for better cross-scene generalization in novel view synthesis. The key ideas and contributions are:- Introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into the generalizable NeRF framework to help balance between higher model capacity for general scene coverage and flexible per-scene specialization. - Customizes MoE for NeRF's demands by proposing a shared permanent expert to enforce consistency across scenes, and a geometry-aware spatial consistency objective for smooth view transitions.- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex scene benchmarks under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Remarkably outperforms prior arts in rendering novel views of unseen scenes.- Provides analysis on the expert selection behaviors to demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively divide and conquer different components in novel view synthesis while maintaining cross-view/cross-scene consistency.In summary, the key contribution is introducing and properly customizing MoE into the generalizable NeRF framework to enhance its generalization capability, via an architecture that balances between overall capacity and specialized flexibility tailored for individual scenes. The experiments validate superior cross-scene generalization ability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a transformer-based neural radiance field model called GNT-MOVE that incorporates mixture-of-experts layers to improve cross-scene generalization for novel view synthesis, and introduces customizations like a shared permanent expert and geometry-aware spatial consistency loss to make the mixture-of-experts framework suitable for rendering consistent and smooth novel views of complex unseen scenes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of neural radiance fields (NeRF):- The main contribution of this paper is introducing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to NeRF in order to improve generalization across different scenes. This builds off prior work like GNT that used transformers for generalized NeRF modeling, but is novel in its use of MoE and customizations like the permanent expert and spatial consistency loss.- Most prior work on NeRF focuses on optimizing a radiance field for a single scene. There has been some recent work on generalizable NeRF like GNT, PixelNeRF, and others this paper compares to. But the use of MoE and the custom regularizers is a new technique proposed here.- This paper focuses on feedforward generalization, meaning inferring novel views of new scenes directly without additional optimization. Other works like MVSNeRF and IBRNet require some per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. So this is more flexible.- The MoE framework connects ideas from large language models like GShard to 3D vision for the first time. Itâ€™s an interesting crossover of techniques between modalities.- The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on complex scene datasets like LLFF, Shiny, and Tanks and Temples. This shows the real-world potential of the methods.- Limitations include primarily modifying the view transformer rather than the ray transformer with MoE, and potential efficiency issues scaling up scenes compared to specialized or distilled NeRF variants. But the generalization is a clear strength.Overall, the paper makes important innovations in bringing MoE and expert techniques to generalized NeRFs, with custom designs to handle scene consistency. It pushes the state-of-the-art for this cross-scene feedforward setting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring different architectures for the view transformer and ray transformer in GNT-MOVE. The authors mainly focused on incorporating MoE into the view transformer in this work. They suggest also exploring using MoE in the ray transformer as future work.- Applying the MoE idea to other transformer-based generalizable NeRF methods besides GNT, such as NeuRay, IBRNet, etc. The authors believe the MoE customization strategies proposed in this paper could be generalizable to other transformer NeRF architectures.- Scaling up the model size and number of experts in GNT-MOVE for even better performance. The authors used a relatively small model with 4 experts per layer in this work. Scaling up the model could potentially improve the results further.- Pre-training the model on more diverse and complex indoor/outdoor scenes to enhance its generalization capability. The model was pre-trained mostly on synthetic and forward-facing scenes in this work. More complex real-world data could help it generalize better.- Exploring different expert selection strategies instead of top-K gating. The authors suggest that techniques like learned routing may further improve the model.- Applying the model to novel view synthesis tasks beyond static scenes, like novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes. The authors suggest extending the model to handle video input in future work.- Combining GNT-MOVE with explicit 3D representations to further improve results. The authors suggest that combining the strengths of volumetric and implicit neural scene representations could be a promising direction.In summary, the main future directions are around scaling up the model, exploring different architectures and routing strategies, pre-training on more diverse data, and extending the model to dynamic scenes and explicit 3D representations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes GNT-MOVE, a novel framework for cross-scene generalizable neural radiance field (NeRF) modeling that introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) transformers into the domain of NeRFs. GNT-MOVE is based on the Generalizable NeRF Transformer (GNT) architecture and enhances it by embedding MoE layers in the view transformer module. This allows balancing between generality across diverse scenes and specialization for each individual scene. To tailor MoE specifically for generalizable NeRF, the authors introduce two key customizations: 1) A shared permanent expert that enforces consistency across different scenes for similar patterns/materials; 2) A spatial consistency objective that encourages nearby views to have smooth expert selection based on geometric distance. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization performance to novel scenes under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. GNT-MOVE shows improved rendering quality, especially for complex lighting, materials, and geometry. The customized MoE enables partitioning the complex scene modeling into experts specialized for different properties.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:This paper proposes a novel neural radiance field (NeRF) model called GNT-MOVE for cross-scene novel view synthesis. Previous NeRF models require per-scene training and do not generalize well to novel scenes. GNT-MOVE introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) transformer into the NeRF framework to balance between generalizability across diverse scenes and specialization for individual scenes. The MoE allows different subsets of experts to be activated for different inputs, increasing the model capacity without significantly increasing computational cost. To customize MoE for cross-scene NeRF, GNT-MOVE proposes two key components: 1) A shared permanent expert that enforces consistency across different scenes with similar patterns. 2) A spatial smoothness objective that maintains geometric continuity across views by encouraging nearby points to select similar experts. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of GNT-MOVE on complex benchmarks under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. The results validate its effectiveness in improving generalization across diverse scenes while retaining capacity to specialize for each scene. The architectural innovations to incorporate and regularize MoE in the NeRF pipeline are the main contributions.
