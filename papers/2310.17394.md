# [Enhancing Graph Neural Networks with Structure-Based Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17394)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes a novel structure-based prompting method called SAP for graph neural networks (GNNs). The key idea is to unify the objectives of pre-training and prompt tuning by exploiting graph structure information in both stages. For pre-training, the authors use dual-view contrastive learning with an MLP view (node attributes) and GNN view (node attributes and graph structure) to align the latent spaces. For prompt tuning, class prototype vectors are added as nodes to the graph and connected via learnable weighted edges to the original nodes to elicit more pre-trained knowledge. These edge weights are learned via contrastive loss between the MLP view of labeled nodes and the GNN view of prototypes. Experiments on node and graph classification tasks demonstrate SAP's effectiveness, especially in few-shot scenarios and on heterophilous graphs. The unified training paradigm and incorporation of structure information in prompt tuning enable SAP to outperform strong baselines like GPPT, GraphPrompt, and GPF. Overall, this work presents a novel and effective prompting approach for GNNs that leverages structure information for superior performance.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel structure-based prompting method for graph neural networks called SAP, which unifies the objectives of pre-training and prompt tuning. In the pre-training stage, it uses dual-view contrastive learning with an MLP view (only using node attributes) and a GNN view (using both node attributes and graph structure) to align the latent spaces. For prompt tuning, it adds learnable weighted edges between prototype vectors and original nodes to incorporate structure information. Node representations from the MLP view serve as anchors, while prototype vectors from the GNN view are treated as positives/negatives for contrastive learning to optimize the edge weights. This allows prototypes to aggregate information from all nodes in the graph. Experiments on node and graph classification tasks demonstrate SAP's effectiveness, especially on few-shot learning and on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs. The unified training strategy and incorporation of structure information are the main strengths of SAP.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification and graph classification by better utilizing structure information from the graph in both pre-training and prompt tuning stages. 

The key hypothesis is that incorporating structure information more consistently throughout the model training process, via a dual-view contrastive pre-training approach and structure-based prompt tuning, will allow the model to learn more robust representations and achieve better performance, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.

Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called SAP that:

- Employs a dual-view contrastive pre-training to align attribute and structure spaces.

- Introduces a structure prompt by connecting prototype vectors to graph nodes, with learnable edge weights. 

- Tunes the prompt using labeled nodes as anchors and prototypes as positive/negative samples.

The hypothesis is that this unified approach can elicit more pre-trained knowledge during prompt tuning and handle heterophily better, leading to accuracy gains particularly when labeled data is scarce. Experiments on node and graph classification tasks, including few-shot settings, validate the effectiveness of SAP.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel structure-based prompting method (SAP) for graph neural networks (GNNs), which unifies the objectives of pre-training and prompt tuning and integrates structural information in both stages. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a dual-view contrastive pre-training method to align the latent semantic spaces of node attributes and graph structure.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions compared to other related work on graph neural networks (GNNs):

- It proposes a new pre-training and prompt tuning framework called SAP that consistently leverages graph structure information in both stages. Most prior work utilizes structure in pre-training but neglects it during prompt tuning. 

- It introduces a novel prompt tuning strategy that connects prototype vectors to all nodes in the graph via learnable weighted edges. This allows exploiting information from unlabeled nodes when learning the prototypes.

- It demonstrates strong performance in few-shot learning scenarios, especially on heterophilous graphs. The method is robust to labeled data scarcity and heterogeneity in the graph structure.

- The ablation studies provide useful analysis and insights on the benefits of the proposed pre-training and prompt tuning approaches.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my understanding, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Extending the structure-based prompting method to other graph learning tasks like graph regression and link prediction. The current work focuses on node classification and graph classification.

- Exploring different strategies to initialize the edge weights between prototype vectors and original nodes. The current work uses a simple initialization based on the inner product between node embeddings. More advanced initialization strategies may further improve performance. 

- Applying the idea of structure-based prompting to other domains like natural language processing and computer vision, where the relationships between samples can also be represented as graphs.

- Developing theoretical understandings on why and how structure-based prompting works, e.g., analyzing the effect of adding structure prompts on the graph topology and its impact on learning.

- Considering other types of graphs like dynamic graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and hypergraphs to see if structure-based prompting can generalize well.

- Scaling up the model to large-scale graphs with millions of nodes and edges using advanced designing and optimizations like sampling techniques.

In summary, the authors point out several potential extensions of the current work to advance research on structure-based prompting and prompt tuning of graph neural networks. The key is to leverage graph structure information in creative ways during prompting.
