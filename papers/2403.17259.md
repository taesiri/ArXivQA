# [Diffusion-based Negative Sampling on Graphs for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Diffusion-based Negative Sampling on Graphs for Link Prediction":

Problem:
- Link prediction is an important task in graph analysis with applications like social network analysis and recommendation systems. 
- Modern methods adopt a contrastive approach which requires negative sampling. However, existing negative sampling strategies are either inflexible based on heuristics or difficult to control using adversarial methods. 
- Furthermore, most methods sample from the observed graph which can be noisy or incomplete, missing potentially better negatives in the latent space.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a novel multi-level negative sampling strategy to generate negatives with flexible hardness levels from the latent space using diffusion models. 
- Employs a conditional diffusion model that learns the one-hop neighborhood distribution of a query node. Can sample at different time steps to control hardness.
- Time step acts as a proxy for hardness - smaller time steps give harder negatives. Enables mixing multi-level negatives.
- Shows the negative density function follows the sub-linear positivity principle for robust sampling.

Key Contributions:
- Investigates the novel strategy of multi-level negative sampling for link prediction.
- Proposes a new method DMNS using conditional diffusion models to generate controllable multi-level negatives.
- Demonstrates the negative distribution obeys sub-linear positivity principle.
- Conducts extensive experiments on benchmarks, analyzing various aspects like ablation, parameter sensitivity. 
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on link prediction task across datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes a flexible and robust negative sampling framework for link prediction using diffusion models to generate multi-level negatives, with both theoretical and empirical backing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel negative sampling method for graph link prediction based on a conditional diffusion model, which generates multi-level negative examples with flexible hardness control to improve contrastive learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Investigating a novel strategy of multi-level negative sampling for graph link prediction. Existing methods aim to retrieve hard negative examples heuristically or adversarially, but they are often inflexible or difficult to control the "hardness". 

2) Proposing a novel sampling method named DMNS (Diffusion-based Multi-level Negative Sampling) based on a conditional diffusion model, which enables flexibly controlling the hardness of negative examples by sampling from different time steps of the diffusion process.

3) Showing that the distribution of negative examples generated by DMNS largely follows the sub-linear positivity principle for robust negative sampling. 

4) Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of DMNS on benchmark datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the DMNS framework for flexible and controllable multi-level negative sampling to improve graph link prediction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

- Link prediction - The main prediction task that the paper focuses on. It aims to model the probability of links between nodes in a network.

- Negative sampling - A key technique used in contrastive learning methods for link prediction. The paper investigates strategies for generating negative examples. 

- Diffusion models - The paper proposes using conditional diffusion models to generate multi-level negative samples. Key aspects include the forward diffusion process, reverse denoising process, and reparameterization trick.

- Multi-level sampling - The key idea proposed in the paper is to generate negative examples with different levels of "hardness", in order to improve contrastive learning.

- Sub-linear positivity - A principle for robust negative sampling that the distribution of negatives should be positively but sub-linearly correlated with the positive distribution. The paper shows the negative samples from the diffusion model satisfy this principle.

- Markov chains - Diffusion models utilize Markov chains with multiple steps to gradually denoise random inputs. This allows accessing samples at different levels of noise corresponding to different hardness levels.

So in summary, the key terms cover link prediction, negative sampling strategies, diffusion models for generative sampling, multi-level sampling idea, theoretical principles, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
