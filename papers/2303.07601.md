# [V2V4Real: A Real-world Large-scale Dataset for Vehicle-to-Vehicle   Cooperative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07601)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a large-scale, real-world dataset to facilitate research on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception for autonomous driving? 

The key hypothesis is that by collecting and releasing such a multimodal dataset, covering diverse driving scenarios and annotated with 3D boxes and HD maps, it will enable the development and benchmarking of V2V perception algorithms to overcome limitations like occlusions and short perceiving range faced by individual vehicle perception systems.

To summarize, the main goal of this paper is to introduce a new benchmark dataset, called V2V4Real, to promote progress in V2V cooperative perception research by providing real-world data as well as benchmarks for tasks like cooperative object detection, tracking and domain adaptation. The paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of V2V collaboration and evaluate state-of-the-art methods on this dataset.
