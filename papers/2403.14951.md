## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Simple Graph Condensation":

Problem: 
Existing graph condensation methods rely on complex metrics to align the condensed graph with the original graph, such as matching gradients, output distributions, or training trajectories of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these complex metrics require intricate computations, disrupt the optimization process, and incur high computational costs, making graph condensation demanding and unstable. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a simplified framework called Simple Graph Condensation (SimGC) that eliminates external parameters and relies solely on aligning the condensed graph with the original graph to reduce unnecessary complexity. 

The key ideas are:

1) Pre-train a Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) model on the original graph to capture semantics between features, structure and labels.

2) Align condensed graph from input layer to output prediction layer with original graph guided by SGC:
- Align input features by matching statistics of representations 
- Align output prediction by matching logits

3) Enhance interdependent learning of features and structures in condensed graph with a smoothness regularizer.

4) Optimize only the condensed graph without any external parameters during condensation.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a simplified methodology called Simple Graph Condensation (SimGC) that eliminates external parameters and relies solely on aligning the condensed graph with the original graph.

- Achieves 10x speedup compared to prior graph condensation methods while maintaining competitive accuracy.

- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets across different reduction rates.

- Condensed graphs generated by SimGC exhibit strong generalization capability across various graph neural network architectures.

In summary, SimGC provides a simplified yet effective framework for graph condensation that achieves significant improvements in efficiency and competitive performance by streamlining the metric alignment process.
