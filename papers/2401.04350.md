# [Pre-trained Model Guided Fine-Tuning for Zero-Shot Adversarial   Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large-scale pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP show impressive performance and zero-shot generalization capability, but are vulnerable to adversarial examples. 
- Existing defense methods like adversarial training can enhance robustness but may compromise CLIP's generalization ability due to overfitting when applied directly.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new adversarial fine-tuning method called Pre-trained Model Guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (PMG-AFT).
- PMG-AFT incorporates supervision from the original pre-trained CLIP model via an auxiliary branch during adversarial fine-tuning. 
- It minimizes the distance between embeddings of adversarial examples in target model and pre-trained model to preserve features that capture the generalization capability.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes PMG-AFT method that retains generalization features from pre-trained model to mitigate overfitting and enhance zero-shot adversarial robustness.  
- Introduces improvements in the parameters update phase combining well with adversarial example generation methods.
- Experiments show PMG-AFT outperforms state-of-the-art by average 4.99% in zero-shot robust accuracy across 15 datasets.
- PMG-AFT also improves average clean accuracy by 8.72% demonstrating superiority in balancing robustness and accuracy.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of compromised generalization in adversarial fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models. It proposes a novel method PMG-AFT that effectively retains generalization features from original pre-trained model leading to enhanced zero-shot adversarial robustness as well as clean accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel adversarial fine-tuning method called Pre-trained Model Guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (PMG-AFT) that enhances the adversarial robustness and generalizability of large pre-trained vision-language models by minimizing the distance between embeddings of adversarial examples in the target model and the original pre-trained model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the PMG-AFT method, which learns generalization features from the original pre-trained model to mitigate overfitting and enhance the zero-shot adversarial robustness of the CLIP model. 

2. The method introduces improvements during the parameters update phase of adversarial fine-tuning and can effectively combine with defense frameworks that originate from the perspective of adversarial example generation.

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMG-AFT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of zero-shot robust accuracy and clean accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the PMG-AFT method to improve the zero-shot adversarial robustness of vision-language models like CLIP, while also maintaining good performance on clean images. This is achieved by using supervision from the original pre-trained model to retain generalized features during adversarial fine-tuning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Zero-shot adversarial robustness - The paper focuses on improving the robustness of vision-language models like CLIP to adversarial attacks, even on unseen datasets not used during training. This concept of "zero-shot" generalization of robustness is a core theme. 

- Adversarial training/fine-tuning - The paper proposes a novel adversarial fine-tuning method called PMG-AFT to enhance model robustness. Adversarial training techniques are key.

- Overfitting - The paper analyzes how adversarial fine-tuning can lead models to overfit, losing generalization ability. Mitigating overfitting is an important goal. 

- Vision-language models - The CLIP model is used as a case study in the paper as an example of a large pre-trained vision-language model. Understanding these models is key background.

- Generalization - The paper aims to improve robustness while retaining the impressive generalization capabilities that models like CLIP exhibit. Preserving generalization is a central focus. 

- Loss functions - The paper introduces new loss terms like the "generalization information loss" as part of the PMG-AFT framework to help preserve model generalization ability. The design of the loss function is impactful.

In summary, the key themes have to do with advancing zero-shot adversarial robustness for vision-language models like CLIP in a way that mitigates overfitting and retains the model's inherent generalization strengths.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Pre-trained Model Guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (PMG-AFT) method. Can you explain in detail how this method works and what are the key components? 

2. The PMG-AFT method introduces an auxiliary generalization information branch during adversarial fine-tuning. What is the motivation behind this design and how does it help mitigate overfitting?

6. How does the proposed PMG-AFT method qualitatively differ from existing defense methods like adversarial training and what are its advantages? 

7. The paper evaluates PMG-AFT on CLIP model. Do you think the proposed method can generalize to other vision-language models? Why or why not?

8. Can you analyze the time and space complexity of PMG-AFT? How does it compare with baseline methods?

9. The method improves both robust accuracy and clean accuracy. Can you explain why both are improved and the trade-offs involved?
