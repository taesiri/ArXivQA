# [Understanding Likelihood of Normalizing Flow and Image Complexity   through the Lens of Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep generative models (DGMs) like normalizing flows and autoregressive models are expected to assign higher likelihood (probability density) to in-distribution (In-Dist) data than out-of-distribution (OOD) data. However, perplexingly it has been found that they often assign higher likelihoods to unknown OOD inputs.  
- This phenomenon is referred to as the "failure of likelihood" and undermines the credibility of likelihood-based tests for OOD detection using DGMs.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper hypothesizes that less complex images concentrate in high-density regions of the DGM's latent space. This results in higher likelihood assignments by the model, irrespective of whether the images are In-Dist or OOD.
- They refer to this as the "Density Concentration Attraction for Simpleness (DCAS)" effect. The DCAS causes OOD images with less complexity to be mapped closer to the high-density region, leading to higher likelihoods.
- They propose that explicitly modeling image complexity as an independent variable, in addition to the latent space likelihood, can mitigate this issue.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a hypothesis explaining why OOD images with less complexity get higher likelihoods in DGMs. Unifies explanations for two questions - why less complex images get higher likelihoods and why OOD data is sometimes wrongly identified as belonging to the typical set.  
- Validates the DCAS hypothesis through experiments on 5 normalizing flow architectures. Shows DCAS occurs irrespective of architecture. Concludes that reliance solely on likelihoods from normalizing flows is untenable.
- Demonstrates that modeling complexity as an independent variable alleviates the problem. A simple Gaussian mixture model combining complexity and likelihood perfectly detects all OOD data in the experiments.
- Provides evidence that the DCAS hypothesis likely applies to autoregressive models as well. Complexity-aware PixelCNN++ significantly outperforms baseline on OOD detection.

In summary, the paper clearly explains the mechanism behind the "failure of likelihood" phenomenon in DGMs and shows that explicitly accounting for image complexity information can overcome this fundamental limitation of likelihood-based OOD detection approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and validates a hypothesis explaining why normalizing flows assign higher likelihoods to less complex out-of-distribution images, attributable to density concentration in the latent space attracting less complex images regardless of their distribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents a hypothesis that explains how image complexity can arbitrarily control the likelihood of Normalizing Flows (NFs) and how the density concentration in the latent space causes this phenomenon.

2) The hypothesis provides a unified explanation for two questions: why images with less complexity are assigned high likelihood and why out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs are regarded as in-distribution samples in some cases. 

3) The paper experimentally verifies the argument with five different NF architectures and concludes that OOD detection based on the likelihood of NFs is untrustworthy.

In summary, the key contribution is the hypothesis along with its experimental validation, which shows that the likelihood of NFs is untrustworthy for OOD detection due to the influence of image complexity and density concentration in the latent space. The paper also proposes a potential solution by treating image complexity as an independent variable.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection
- Deep generative models (DGMs) 
- Normalizing flows (NFs)
- Likelihood-based methods
- Image complexity
- Density concentration
- Typical set
- Gaussian mixture model (GMM)

The paper focuses on explaining the failure cases of likelihood-based OOD detection methods using deep generative models like normalizing flows. It hypothesizes that image complexity and density concentration in the latent space of NFs can arbitrarily control the assigned likelihoods. The paper proposes using image complexity as an extra variable along with likelihood to improve OOD detection performance. Key terms like "out-of-distribution detection", "normalizing flows", "image complexity", "density concentration", and "likelihood" are central to the paper's hypothesis and experiments. The Gaussian mixture model is used to demonstrate improved detection by incorporating image complexity. Overall, these are some of the important terminology and concepts discussed in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that less complex images are mapped to high-density regions in the latent space of normalizing flows. What is the underlying mechanism that causes this phenomenon? Can you explain the proposed "Density Concentration Attraction for Simpleness (DCAS)" in more detail?

2. The paper shows experimentally that image complexity is negatively correlated with the latent vector norm ||z|| in normalizing flows. However, what is the theoretical justification for using ||z|| as a proxy for the latent log-likelihood log p(z)?

3. The proposed hypothesis seems to provide a unified explanation for two separate questions - why less complex images get higher likelihoods, and why out-of-distribution images are sometimes regarded as typical set samples. Can you elaborate on how the hypothesis links these two phenomena?  

4. The paper concludes that the likelihood from normalizing flows is "untrustworthy" for out-of-distribution detection. However, the method still uses the latent space log-likelihood log p(z) as an input feature to the Gaussian Mixture Model. Why is log p(z) still useful in this context?

5. What is the intuition behind selecting Glow, iResFlow and ResFlow architectures over CV-Glow and IDF for the experiments on out-of-distribution detection? How do architectural differences in normalizing flows impact sensitivity to image complexity?

6. The proposed complexity-aware method using a Gaussian Mixture Model achieves very strong performance. What are the benefits of modeling image complexity and latent log-likelihood as two separate variables instead of combining them into a single score?

7. The paper hypothesizes that the proposed explanation may extend to autoregressive models like PixelCNN++. What evidence is presented to support this claim? And what theoretical justification can be provided relating normalizing flows and autoregressive models?

8. One limitation mentioned is that the method has only been evaluated on dataset-level out-of-distribution detection tasks. What additional experiments could be done to test semantic or fine-grained out-of-distribution detection? 

9. Shannon's source coding theorem is discussed in the context of linking compression, complexity and likelihoods. Can you explain in more detail how the theorem provides supporting evidence for the hypotheses made in this paper?

10. The method trains a model to fit the distribution of in-distribution data. How could the approach be extended to an open-world setting where new unknown datasets are continuously encountered? Would the model need to be continually updated?
