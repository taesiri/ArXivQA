## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper surveys recent progress in time series forecasting, with a focus on deep learning techniques and their application to pandemic prediction. Accurate pandemic forecasting is critically needed but faces challenges like short time series for training models and difficulty in capturing complex spatial-temporal dynamics.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper reviews two waves of progress in time series forecasting. The first wave led to statistical models like SARIMAX that set strong baselines. The second wave utilizes advanced deep learning architectures like transformers and graph neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy by better modeling temporal and spatial dependencies. The paper also discusses emerging directions like foundation models and integration of knowledge graphs to further enhance forecasting capabilities.

For pandemic prediction, the paper highlights encoder-decoder transformers with attention mechanisms as top performers for national-level forecasting by excellently modeling temporal dynamics. For state-level prediction, graph neural networks are ideal for capturing spatial influences. The paper suggests combining these approaches and injecting scientific knowledge for optimal pandemic forecasting.  

Main Contributions:
- Reviews the evolution of time series forecasting, culminating in recent deep learning breakthroughs
- Analyzes transformer and graph neural network architectures for temporal and spatial modeling  
- Discusses using foundation models and knowledge graphs to overcome data scarcity issues
- Evaluates various models on benchmark time series problems  
- Provides COVID-19 forecasting examples and suggests techniques like encoder-decoder transformers, graph networks, knowledge infusion, and model fusion for accurate pandemic prediction

The paper offers a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and future directions in time series forecasting, with valuable insights for tackling real-world problems like pandemic forecasting.
