# [GIRT-Model: Automated Generation of Issue Report Templates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Issue report templates (IRTs) help improve issue management and align better with developer expectations. However, IRT adoption rates are low (only 5\% on GitHub). There are currently no tools available to assist developers in creating customized IRTs. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes GIRT-Model, an assistant language model capable of automatically generating IRTs based on developer instructions. The model is trained on GIRT-Instruct, a new dataset comprising of 205,452 pairs of IRT generation instructions and corresponding IRTs extracted and derived from the GIRT-Data dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of GIRT-Model, the first automated IRT generation tool to assist developers in creating customized issue report templates.

- Release of GIRT-Instruct, a large instructional dataset for training models on the task of IRT generation.

- Experimental results showing GIRT-Model significantly outperforms baselines like T5 and Flan-T5 on automated metrics (ROUGE, BLEU etc. - over 34% better) and human evaluations (over 48% better).

- A user study indicating developers find GIRT-Model useful, easy to use, inspiring and effective in achieving goals for IRT creation.

The proposed approach and model have the potential to encourage greater IRT adoption rates by making it simpler for developers to generate customized issue report templates aligned to their individual project needs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1. Introducing GIRT-Model, an assistant language model tool capable of automatically generating customized issue report templates (IRTs) based on developers' input instructions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first IRT generation tool.

2. Releasing GIRT-Instruct, a dataset of over 200,000 pairs of instructions and IRTs. This instructional dataset is used to train the GIRT-Model.

3. Showing through experiments that GIRT-Model outperforms several baselines (T5 and Flan-T5 models of varying sizes) by a large margin in metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR, as well as in human evaluation.

4. Conducting a user study with 10 software engineers, demonstrating that participants find GIRT-Model beneficial in assisting them to write IRTs, rating it highly for usefulness, ease of use, goal achievement, and inspiration.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and evaluation of GIRT-Model, a novel AI assistant tool for automating the generation of customized issue report templates based on developer instructions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors introduce a new dataset called "GIRT-Instruct". How was this dataset created? What data sources were used and what pre-processing steps were taken? What are some limitations of this dataset?

2. The core of the proposed method is instruction-tuning a T5 model using the GIRT-Instruct dataset. Explain in detail how instruction-tuning works. What modifications were made to the training process? How were the instructions formatted? 

3. The authors evaluated their model using automated metrics like ROUGE and BLEU as well as human evaluation. What were the key findings from both types of evaluations? What are the limitations of relying solely on automated metrics for this task?

4. In the human evaluation, the authors compared their model against the Flan-Large model. Why was Flan-Large chosen over the other baseline models? What prompted the authors to only select this single baseline model for the human evaluation?

5. The authors conducted an empirical user study to evaluate the model's effectiveness in practice. Explain the study design. How many participants were there and what tasks were they asked to complete? What metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance?

6. In the user study, participants gave high ratings for "Usefulness" and "Goal Achievement". Analyze these results - why did participants find the model useful and able to help them achieve their goals? Did they accept the model's outputs verbatim or did they edit them?

7. One limitation raised is that the model's performance depends heavily on the quality of the GIRT-Instruct dataset. Discuss how enhancements to this dataset could lead to improvements in the model. What additional sources of data could be incorporated?

8. The authors use the Zephyr language model to generate summary fields for the GIRT-Instruct dataset. Critically analyze this decision - what are the potential benefits and drawbacks? How could human annotations improve this process?

9. The model currently only supports the Markdown format for issue report templates. Discuss the challenges associated with extending support to other formats like YAML. Would the model need to be retrained? How would the evaluation process differ?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on issue report templates for GitHub. How could this approach be extended to support other platforms like GitLab or Bitbucket? Would new datasets need to be collected from those platforms? How transferable are models between platforms?
