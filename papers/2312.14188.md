# [Enhancing Neural Theorem Proving through Data Augmentation and Dynamic   Sampling Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14188)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Automating theorem proving is an important challenge in AI and mathematics. However, there are limited formalized proofs available to train machine learning models. Existing methods also require complex setups with multiple models, making them computationally expensive. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces two main contributions - 

1) DS-Prover: A new dynamic sampling method that adjusts the number of proof tactics to try over time, balancing exploration and exploitation. This allows searching deeper in the proof tree compared to fixed sampling.

2) Data Augmentation: The training data is increased by decomposing tactics with multiple premises into separate tactics with single premises. This provides more examples to the model for learning premises.

The authors use a single ByT5 model for tactic prediction, combined with the Lean theorem prover for verification. Proof search uses best-first search guided by tactic confidence scores.

Results:
The data augmentation and dynamic sampling methods achieve new state-of-the-art results on the MiniF2F (29.8% pass@1) and ProofNet (14.2% pass@1) benchmark datasets. Analysis shows dynamic sampling discovers more longer proofs by exploring deeper in the search tree over time. The augmented data also consistently outperforms just using the original dataset across tests.

The methods present a computationally cheaper way to enhance neural theorem proving performance, with public access provided through a website to submit problems.
