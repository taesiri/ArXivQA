# [Exploring Value Biases: How LLMs Deviate Towards the Ideal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11005)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding the non-deliberate sampling mechanism of large language models (LLMs) is important to explain their performance and discern their biases. This sampling is akin to human "System 1" thinking.   
- Prior work has studied LLM biases like gender, stereotypes etc. But foundational biases manifesting as different forms of biases need more investigation. 

Method:
- The paper introduces the concept of "value bias" where LLM samples deviate from likely values towards some "ideal" value based on an implicit or contextual notion of value.
- Three experiments are designed - evaluating implicit value bias, bias with distributions/values provided contextually, and in judging concept prototypes.  
- Metrics like alpha and normalized alpha are used to quantify the deviation between "average", "ideal" and "sample" values reported by the LLM.

Results:
- LLMs show significant implicit value bias in sampling answers to various category questions.
- Value bias reproduces even for made-up concepts provided contextually, with samples shifting based on positive/negative value associations.
- Value bias also impacts prototype judgments, with samples drifting towards "ideal" prototypes.
- But LLM's value systems don't fully correlate with human value systems.

Contributions:  
- Demonstrating and quantifying value bias in LLMs across different settings. 
- Showing this bias manifests even for newly learned concepts.
- Analyzing alignment with human value systems.
- Discussing implications like impact on prototypicality evaluations and text summarization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

The paper shows that large language models exhibit a value bias in sampling responses, deviating from statistical likelihood towards an implicit notion of "ideal" that either stems from the model's training or can be learned from context, with implications for prototype formation and other applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It shows that large language models (LLMs) exhibit a value bias in their response sampling. Specifically, the samples drawn by the LLM tend to deviate from the statistically average value towards some notion of an "ideal" value. 

2) It demonstrates this value bias occurs for concepts with implicit value associations in the LLM, as well as for newly learned concepts presented explicitly in the prompt context.

3) It explores the implications of this value bias in LLMs for judging the prototypicality of concepts, showing the prototype identified differs from the statistical average. 

4) It compares the value bias in LLMs to results from human experiments, finding that while a value bias exists in both, the specific value systems may not always align between humans and LLMs.

In summary, the main contribution is revealing and analyzing an underlying value bias that influences the response sampling of LLMs, with potential impacts on real-world applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Value bias - The paper examines how large language models exhibit a tendency to favor high-value options when sampling responses, deviating from the most likely options towards an "ideal" that represents a notion of value.

- Sampling heuristics - The paper investigates the heuristics that guide how LLMs narrow down possibilities when sampling responses. 

- Human possibility sampling - The paper draws parallels to concepts from psychology like human possibility sampling and how factors like value and likelihood shape what options come to mind.

- Average, ideal, sample - Key terms used in the experiments to examine value biases. The "average" refers to the statistically normal option, "ideal" refers to a high value option, and "sample" is what the LLM produces. 

- Learned value systems - The paper examines how value biases manifest even when LLMs are given new value systems for novel concepts within a provided context. 

- Prototypes and exemplars - The paper explores how value biases shape how LLMs judge prototypicality and categorize exemplars.

- Implications for applications - The paper discusses the potential impacts of observed value biases in areas like summarization.

The key focus is on understanding and evaluating the value biases that shape the possibility sampling of large language models as a non-deliberative response mechanism.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "value bias" in language models. How is this concept defined and how does it differ from other biases like popularity bias or stereotype bias that have been studied before?

2. The notion of "average", "ideal", and "sample" values is central to measuring value bias. Can you explain in more detail how these values are obtained from the language model and what they signify? 

3. One of the key claims is that language models sample from a distribution that considers both likelihood and value. What evidence from psychology or neuroscience is provided to motivate this hypothesis about dual sampling?

4. Experiment 1 aims to show implicit value bias in language models. What were some of the prompt design choices made here to query for the "average" and "ideal" values? How reliable do you think these values are?

5. In Experiment 2, a fictional concept "glubbing" is introduced to study value bias for newly learned concepts. What are some ways the distribution and value system for glubbing are conveyed in the prompts?

6. The paper argues value bias could impact applications like summarization. But the example provided has some limitations. Can you think of better ways to demonstrate the real-world impact of value bias?  

7. Prototype theory is leveraged in Experiment 3 to show value bias. For readers unfamiliar with this theory, can you explain why prototypicality judgments are relevant for studying value bias?

8. The paper concludes language models have a value bias, but there is mismatch with human value systems. Do you think the experiments provided adequately capture human values to make this conclusion?

9. The implications discuss connections to dual process theory and heuristics in decision making. Can you expand on these connections and how they might explain the origin of value bias?

10. The paper focuses entirely on studying and demonstrating the presence of value bias. What do you think are some worthwhile next steps in this research direction?
