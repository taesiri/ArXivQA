# [Exploring Value Biases: How LLMs Deviate Towards the Ideal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11005)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding the non-deliberate sampling mechanism of large language models (LLMs) is important to explain their performance and discern their biases. This sampling is akin to human "System 1" thinking.   
- Prior work has studied LLM biases like gender, stereotypes etc. But foundational biases manifesting as different forms of biases need more investigation. 

Method:
- The paper introduces the concept of "value bias" where LLM samples deviate from likely values towards some "ideal" value based on an implicit or contextual notion of value.
- Three experiments are designed - evaluating implicit value bias, bias with distributions/values provided contextually, and in judging concept prototypes.  
- Metrics like alpha and normalized alpha are used to quantify the deviation between "average", "ideal" and "sample" values reported by the LLM.

Results:
- LLMs show significant implicit value bias in sampling answers to various category questions.
- Value bias reproduces even for made-up concepts provided contextually, with samples shifting based on positive/negative value associations.
- Value bias also impacts prototype judgments, with samples drifting towards "ideal" prototypes.
- But LLM's value systems don't fully correlate with human value systems.

Contributions:  
- Demonstrating and quantifying value bias in LLMs across different settings. 
- Showing this bias manifests even for newly learned concepts.
- Analyzing alignment with human value systems.
- Discussing implications like impact on prototypicality evaluations and text summarization.
