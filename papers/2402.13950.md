# [Making Reasoning Matter: Measuring and Improving Faithfulness of   Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) perform better on reasoning tasks when asked to provide step-by-step reasoning (chain-of-thought or CoT) before answering. 
- However, it is unclear whether the LLMs' final answers actually follow from or are "faithful" to the reasoning chains they provide. 
- There is a gap in interpreting the relationship between the generated CoT traces and the final answers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper performs a causal mediation analysis on 12 LLMs to quantify the causal effect of the CoT traces on the final answers. 
- They find significant variation across models and tasks in how strongly the CoT traces affect the final predictions.
- They propose a new method called Frodo that trains small LM modules to:
  - Reliably generate correct reasoning chains (inference module)
  - Faithfully reason over those chains to produce answers (reasoning module)

Key Contributions:
- First work to apply causal mediation analysis to measure faithfulness of LLM CoT reasoning.
- Empirically demonstrates that LLMs do not reliably use their own CoT when generating answers.
- Proposes Frodo method to improve correctness and faithfulness of CoT reasoning in small LMs.
- Experiments show Frodo outperforms baselines on accuracy, robustness to counterfactuals, and out-of-distribution generalization.
- Provides insights into designing models that can reason in a more understandable and trustworthy way.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new method called Frodo to improve the faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models by using a causal mediation analysis to measure how well models use their intermediate reasoning steps, and tailoring small models to generate correct reasoning chains and reason faithfully over them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Frodo that improves the faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models. Specifically, the paper:

1) Performs a causal mediation analysis on 12 LLMs to measure how much intermediate reasoning steps influence the final answer. It finds that LLMs do not reliably use the reasoning steps when generating an answer.

2) Introduces Frodo, which has two components: an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using implicit causal feedback, and a reasoning module that learns to reason faithfully over the steps using counterfactual and causal preference objectives. 

3) Shows experimentally that Frodo outperforms competitive baselines on 4 reasoning tasks. It also improves robustness to out-of-distribution test sets and the faithfulness of rationales compared to standard supervised fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the Frodo framework for improving faithfulness in chain-of-thought reasoning by LLMs.

The paper focuses on measuring and improving the faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning generated by large language models. It uses causal mediation analysis to study the relationship between intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. The proposed method, called Frodo, has an inference module to generate correct reasoning chains and a reasoning module to reason faithfully over them. Experiments show Frodo can improve performance, robustness, and generalization compared to baselines.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the causal mediation analysis specifically help in interpreting the relationship between the chain-of-thought (CoT) traces and the final answer? What assumptions need to be made about the causal graph?

2. The paper mentions obtaining preference data by prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate correct and counterfactual reasoning chains. What considerations should be made in the prompt design and sampling to ensure high-quality and useful preference data?  

3. Why is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) used to train the inference module instead of standard supervised fine-tuning? What are the key advantages of using an implicit causal reward function?

4. What are the limitations of using counterfactual reasoning chains as negative samples when training the reasoning module? Could additional constraints help mitigate issues arising from unrealistic or incoherent counterfactuals?  

5. How sensitive is the performance of Frodo to the quality and correctness of the reasoning chains generated by the inference module? How can errors propagate?

6. For what types of reasoning tasks would Frodo be most impactful compared to standard chain-of-thought distillation methods? When would the gains be more incremental?

7. The paper analyzes faithfulness only based on accuracy metrics. What other proxy metrics could complement accuracy in assessing reasoning faithfulness? 

8. How do the trends in causal effects across models and tasks inform best practices and design considerations when applying Frodo?

9. What modifications would need to be made to effectively scale up both the inference and reasoning modules of Frodo to larger model sizes? 

10. The paper does not compare against human rationales. How could human studies analyzing reasoning chains further contextualize the performance and faithfulness gains shown?
