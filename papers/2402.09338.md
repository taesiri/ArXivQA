# [Neural Networks Asymptotic Behaviours for the Resolution of Inverse   Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper investigates the effectiveness of neural networks (NNs) for solving deconvolution inverse problems relevant for applications in quantum field theory and other areas. Specifically, it focuses on understanding whether NNs provide significant improvements over traditional methods like Backus-Gilbert (BG) and Gaussian processes (GPs).

- Deconvolution inverse problems refer to reconstructing an unknown continuous function from a finite set of measurements. These problems are inherently ill-posed and ill-conditioned. 

- Recent works have proposed using NNs to extract spectral densities, but it's unclear if NNs yield appreciable benefits over BG and GPs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper studies the asymptotic limits of NNs, corresponding to Gaussian processes, where non-linearities in NN parameters can be neglected. 

- Two GP limits are analyzed - NNGP (infinite width NN with untrained parameters) and NTK-GP (infinite width NN with gradient descent training).

- These GPs are compared to a finite width multilayer perceptron NN with 4 hidden layers for a quantum harmonic oscillator test case.

Key Contributions:
- The paper shows both NNGP and NTK-GP outperform the finite NN for the test case, indicating non-linearities from finite NNs may not help in solving this inverse problem.

- As layer width increases, the finite NN accuracy approaches the GPs, confirming results from computer science literature. 

- Notably, the NTK-GP offers a novel perspective lacking Bayesian interpretation compared to NNGP and established BG/GP methods.

- Provides analytical GP solutions that can substitute costly training of finite NNs.

- Overall, the results indicate more research is needed to understand training dynamics of NNs for spectral density extraction in realistic settings.

In summary, the paper conducts an illuminating numerical study to assess the value of non-linearities in NNs for a model inverse problem, with insights tied to GP theory. Key findings call for more rigorous analysis of trained NNs for spectral reconstruction.
