# [A Unified View on Forgetting and Strong Equivalence Notions in Answer   Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07993)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel relativized equivalence notion called "strong $A$-simplification relative to $B$", which relaxes the recent concept of strong simplification. This unified framework allows capturing related concepts like strong persistence forgetting, faithful abstractions, and relativized strong equivalence. The paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for when a program admits relativized simplification in terms of properties of its relativized SE-models. A key challenge is dealing with atoms to remove that are not present in the context programs. To achieve relativized simplifications, the paper proposes an operator combining projection and a relaxation of strong persistence forgetting. The paper also analyzes the complexity of deciding relativized simplifiability and testing relativized simplifications between programs. Overall, this work makes important connections between different semantics-based methods of abstraction and forgetting in answer set programming.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a novel relativized equivalence notion for answer set programs that captures several related concepts including strong persistence forgetting, faithful abstractions, strong simplifications, and relativized strong equivalence, provides necessary and sufficient conditions for relativized simplifiability along with complexity results, and defines an operator that combines projection and a relaxation of strong persistence forgetting to achieve the desired relativized simplifications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing the novel concept of relativized strong simplification between programs. This is a relaxation of the recent notion of strong simplification, where context programs are allowed to exclude some dedicated atoms. The paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for testing relativized strong simplifiability and gives semantical characterizations of relativized strong simplifications. It also discusses the full spectrum of this new notion by looking at various special cases.

2) Introducing a novel forgetting operator that combines projection and a relaxation of strong persistence forgetting. This operator can be used to obtain the desired relativized simplifications, when they exist. 

3) Providing complexity results that determine the computational complexity of deciding relativized simplifiability and testing whether a program is a relativized simplification of another. These results fill a gap in the landscape of the introduced relativized simplification notion.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the unifying concept of relativized strong simplification between programs and studying its properties and complexity. This helps connect and extend previous works on simplification, forgetting and abstraction in answer set programming.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and contents, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Answer set programming (ASP)
- Forgetting/removal of atoms 
- Strong persistence (SP)
- Strong equivalence (SE)
- Relativized strong equivalence
- Faithful abstractions
- Omission abstractions
- Strong simplifications
- Unified view of forgetting and strong equivalence notions
- Relativized strong simplification 
- Necessary and sufficient conditions for relativized simplifiability
- Combination of projection and forgetting operators
- Relativized strong persistence
- Complexity results

The paper introduces the novel concept of "relativized strong simplification" between logic programs, which relaxes the recent notion of strong simplification. This allows capturing related concepts like strong persistence, faithful abstractions, relativized strong equivalence, etc. under one umbrella. The paper provides conditions for testing relativized simplifiability, semantical characterizations, and discusses the spectrum spanned by this notion. It also introduces an operator combining projection and forgetting to achieve relativized simplifications, proposes "relativized strong persistence", and analyzes the complexity landscape. So in summary, the key focus is on relativized equivalences between logic programs and bringing together different semantics-preserving notions of forgetting and abstraction under this overarching concept.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel relativized equivalence notion that is a relaxation of strong simplification. Can you explain the intuition behind this relaxation and why it helps provide a unified view over related notions in the literature?

2. One key contribution is providing necessary and sufficient conditions for relativized simplifiability. Can you walk through the $\Delta^r$ conditions and the $\Omega_{A,B}$ criterion and explain their role in characterizing when relativized simplifications exist? 

3. The notion of $A$-$B$-SE models is introduced in the paper. What is the intuition behind this concept and how does it relate to characterizing relativized simplifications? Can you illustrate with an example?

4. The paper shows that the challenging cases for relativized simplifiability arise when the context programs do not contain all atoms to remove. Can you explain why this setting makes relativized simplifiability more difficult compared to the case where all atoms appear in the context programs?

5. An operator is introduced that combines projection and a relaxation of strong persistence forgetting. Can you walk through how this operator obtains the desired relativized simplifications? Why is projection useful and where does the challenge arise requiring something closer to forgetting?

6. How does the notion of relativized strong simplification capture existing concepts like strong persistence forgetting as special cases? Can you map out some examples on the spectrum? 

7. One result shows that projecting atoms in $B \cap A$ preserves relativized simplifiability under certain conditions. What is the intuition behind this result? When might it not hold?

8. What new complexity results are contributed in the paper? How do they fit in the overall landscape of problems related to relativized simplification?

9. What are some potential limitations of the relativized simplification notion or the proposed operator? When might they not apply or scale effectively? 

10. The paper focuses on answer set programs. To what extent do you think the notions and techniques introduced could be lifted or adapted to other logical formalisms for knowledge representation and reasoning?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Forgetting or removing irrelevant details is important for knowledge representation and reasoning. Several notions of "forgetting" have been studied for answer set programming (ASP), including strong persistence (SP) forgetting and relaxed notions like faithful abstractions.
- Recent work introduced the concept of strong simplifications, which is stronger than SP forgetting. However, the connections between these different notions were unclear. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the novel concept of "relativized strong simplification", which is a relaxation of strong simplifications. This allows excluding certain atoms from the context programs.
- Relativized strong simplification provides a unified framework that captures all the related notions from the literature like SP forgetting, faithful abstractions, relativized equivalence, etc.

Main Contributions:
- Formal definition of relativized strong simplification and necessary/sufficient conditions for when a program has such a simplification
- Notion of "A-B-SE models", which characterize the semantics of relativized simplifications
- Identified that the challenging case is when context programs do not contain all atoms to remove 
- Introduced a "relativized SP forgetting" operator that combines projection and SP forgetting to achieve relativized simplifications
- Completeness results filling in gaps about complexity of deciding relativized simplifiability and testing simplifications

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards unifying different semantics-based forgetting notions in ASP under one umbrella concept of relativized strong simplification. The conditions, operators and complexity results further our understanding of what makes forgetting in non-monotonic logics like ASP difficult.
