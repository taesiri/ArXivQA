# [Effect of dimensionality change on the bias of word embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Word embeddings are extensively used to represent text data in neural models. The dimensionality (number of dimensions) of embeddings varies based on factors like end task, model capabilities, etc.
- The effect of changing dimensionality on downstream task accuracy is well studied. However, how it affects the bias in word embeddings is not explored properly.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors study the effect of dimensionality change on bias in word embeddings using two static (Word2Vec, fastText) and two context-sensitive (BERT, ElMo) models.
- They vary dimensionality from 20 to 1000 for Word2Vec/fastText. For BERT, embeddings with 128 to 1024 dimensions are compared. For ElMo, 256 to 1024 dimensions are studied.  
- Bias is measured using WEAT (for static embeddings) and C-WEAT (for contextual embeddings) tests over 8 different test cases. 

Key Observations:
- There is significant variation in bias values as dimensionality changes, shown by high standard deviation compared to mean bias.
- No uniform correlation is observed between bias and number of dimensions across different test cases and models. 
- Change in dimensionality affects bias towards different groups differently.

Main Contributions:
- First study analyzing impact of dimensionality change on bias in both static and contextual word embeddings
- Analysis over multiple models and test cases to demonstrate high variation and inconsistent effects 
- Findings highlight need to consider bias while selecting dimensionality for a particular application

The paper concludes that word embedding dimensionality significantly impacts bias in unpredictable ways. So dimensionality should be carefully selected based on downstream task objectives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies how changing the dimensionality of word embeddings affects their bias, finding significant variation with no uniform trend across different word embedding methods and bias tests.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

Studying the effect of changing the dimensionality of word embeddings on the bias present in those embeddings. Specifically, the paper examines both static (Word2Vec, fastText) and context-sensitive (BERT, ElMo) word embedding methods and measures how the bias changes as the dimensionality is varied from 20 to 1000. The key findings are:

1) There is significant variation in the bias of word embeddings as the dimensionality is changed. This is shown by the non-trivial standard deviation values compared to the mean bias values across different tests.

2) There is no uniformity in how dimensionality change affects bias - some biases increase with higher dimensions while others decrease. This is evident from the wide range of correlation values, both positive and negative. 

So in summary, the main contribution is an analysis showing that dimensionality change has a significant and non-uniform effect on the bias in word embeddings. This is an important consideration when selecting dimensionality for real-world applications using word embeddings.

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with it are:

- word embeddings
- bias
- fairness
- dimensionality
- variation
- Word2Vec
- fastText
- BERT

- WEAT 
- C-WEAT

These terms reflect the main focus and contributions of the paper, which is studying how the dimensionality of different word embedding methods affects the bias in the resulting word vectors. The paper experiments with static embedding methods like Word2Vec and fastText as well as contextual methods like BERT and ElMo. It uses bias measurement tests like WEAT and C-WEAT to quantify bias. The key findings are that bias varies significantly with dimensionality changes, but not uniformly across different bias categories or word embedding methods. Overall, the terms cover the main techniques, models, and findings described in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper experiments with both static and dynamic word embeddings. What are the key differences in measuring bias for these two types of embeddings? What modifications were made to the bias measurement tests to handle dynamic embeddings?

2. The paper uses dimensionality reduction techniques to obtain compressed versions of BERT and ElMo. What impact would using knowledge distillation instead have on bias measurement? Would it preserve bias better compared to dimensionality reduction?

3. For static embeddings, only embedding dimensionality is varied from 20 to 1000. How would varying other hyperparameters like context window size or minimum count threshold impact bias? Would increasing training data also affect bias? 

4. The paper computes correlation between bias and embedding dimensionality. However, the correlation values seem low. What other statistical tests can be used to rigorously establish dependence of bias on dimensionality?

5. The paper uses 8 bias measurement test instances from prior work. Could constructing tailored test instances for studying effect of dimensionality give better insights? What should an ideal test instance for this purpose look like?

6. The embeddings are trained on Wikipedia text. How would training on other diverse datasets like social media posts or dialogue corpus impact the observations made in the paper?

7. The paper studies only English embeddings. Would similar effects be observed for multilingual embeddings or embeddings for morphologically rich languages? 

8. The paper computes average bias and variance across test instances. However, a detailed test instance level analysis is missing. Are certain semantic categories more sensitive to dimensionality changes?

9. The paper does not analyze impact of dimensionality reduction on downstream task performance. How does reduced dimensionality affect metrics like accuracy or F1 score for tasks like sentiment analysis?

10. The conclusions focus only on bias. But dimensionality reduction also leads to loss of information. What other semantic properties like analogy detection capability are affected by lower dimensions?
