# [Embedding Hardware Approximations in Discrete Genetic-based Training for   Printed MLPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02930)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Printed electronics (PE) is a promising technology for low-cost, flexible computing devices. However, larger feature sizes in PE make complex machine learning models like multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) very costly in terms of area and power.
- Existing works on approximate computing for printed MLPs are limited as they apply approximations only after training, failing to optimally balance accuracy and hardware efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) based training approach to design approximate printed MLPs. 
- Key ideas:
  - Eliminate multipliers by quantizing weights to powers-of-two during training
  - Approximate adders by selectively removing input bits using "pruning masks"
  - Multi-objective GA optimization to minimize error rate and hardware area 
  - Produce a set of MLP circuits trades off accuracy vs area

Key Contributions:
- First framework to integrate discrete hardware approximations like pruning directly into GA-based printed MLP training
- Outperforms prior printed MLP works in area and power reduction by 5-25x for similar accuracy
- Enables printed battery-powered operation for MLPs (not possible before)
- Reasonable training time despite multi-objective hardware-aware GA optimization
- Overall, advances state-of-the-art in approximate computing for area- and power-constrained printed PE devices


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a genetic algorithm-based training approach to design approximate printed electronics multilayer perceptrons, which achieves over 5x area and power reduction compared to the exact baseline while maintaining accuracy within 5% loss.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a genetic algorithm (GA) based training framework to design approximate and hardware-efficient multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers for printed electronics. Specifically:

- They incorporate hardware approximation techniques like power-of-two weight quantization and fine-grained unstructured pruning into the GA-based training process to explore the discrete approximation space and hardware-software codesign. 

- Their framework formulates the training as a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize both MLP error rate and hardware area. The GA is well-suited to handle this discrete multi-objective optimization.

- Their experiments show the designed approximate printed MLPs achieve over 5x area and power reduction compared to the exact baseline MLPs, while maintaining similar accuracy. This advancement enables printed-battery-powered operation.

- Their MLPs outperform prior state-of-the-art approximate and stochastic printed MLP designs in terms of area, power efficiency, and accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a GA-based hardware-aware training methodology to efficiently design approximate bespoke printed MLPs, delivering significantly improved area and power efficiency.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) based training approach for hardware-aware printed multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Why is a GA suitable for this application compared to gradient-based learning approaches? What are the key benefits it provides?

2) The paper uses a multi-objective optimization formulation with accuracy and area as objectives. What is the rationale behind using a multi-objective approach? How does this enable better accuracy-area tradeoffs compared to a single objective formulation? 

3) The GA in the paper explores both network weights and masks for input pruning. What is the motivation behind making the masks a learnable parameter? How does this impact the search space and learned solutions compared to fixing the masks a priori?

4) Pow2 weight quantization is used in the paper to enable multiplier-less neurons. What hardware benefits does this provide over conventional quantization? Does it have any impact on the GA training process?

5) The paper proposes a FA-based model to estimate adder area during training. What are the limitations of this simple model? Can you suggest more accurate adder area estimation methods that can be incorporated?

6) How sensitive is the proposed approach to GA hyperparameters like population size, mutation rate etc? What is a good methodology to tune these hyperparameters?

7) The paper demonstrates the approach on small MLPs. What challenges do you foresee in scaling this approach to larger neural networks? Are there ways to mitigate the scalability issues?

8) The GA search process is guided by a combination of random exploration and elite solutions propagation. What enhancement can you suggest to the search strategy for faster convergence?  

9) The paper compares against prior bespoke, approximate and stochastic printed MLP designs. What are some other baselines that can be considered for evaluation?

10) The paper focuses only on MLP architectures. Can you discuss how the proposed ideas can be extended to other neural network architectures like CNNs and LSTMs that have wider applicability?
