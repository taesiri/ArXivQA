## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate and reliable sensor measurements are critical for ensuring safety and performance of complex engineering systems like wind turbines. However, sensor faults can degrade reliability. Traditional sensor Fault Detection, Isolation and Accommodation (FDIA) methods have limitations: 
1) Require separate models for detection, isolation and accommodation, which is complex.  
2) Train only on normal data, making inference on faulty data an out-of-distribution problem.
3) Tied to specific neural network architectures.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel sensor FDIA framework using a single "masked model" that simplifies the pipeline and outperforms existing approaches. 

Key ideas:
1) During training, randomly mask sensor channels to create artificial faults. Task is to predict masked channels. 
2) Same model can detect, isolate faulty sensor and replace with predicted value at inference.
3) Applicable to any neural network capable of sequence modeling.
4) Unified training and inference pipeline improves accuracy.

The method is evaluated on a public dataset and applied to a real-world case - detecting proximity sensor faults in GE wind turbines used for estimating blade loads.  

Main Contributions:
1) Novel sensor FDIA framework using masked models and self-supervised learning.
2) Unified pipeline with a single model for detection, isolation and accommodation.
3) General framework applicable to different sensors and engineering systems.
4) Validated effectiveness on public dataset and real-world turbine data.
5) Improves reliability and prevents downtime in complex systems like turbines.

The proposed technique simplifies existing FDIA pipelines, provides a general and unified framework, and demonstrates superior performance. It has the potential for wide application across different sensors and engineering systems.
