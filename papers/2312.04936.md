# [SKT-Hang: Hanging Everyday Objects via Object-Agnostic Semantic Keypoint   Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04936)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key contributions in this paper:

This paper proposes a novel representation called Semantic Keypoint Trajectory (SKT) for enabling robots to hang a wide range of grasped objects onto arbitrary supporting items robustly. SKT simultaneously models the hanging structure on the supporting item and the movements of relevant keypoints on the objects to be hung. To generate SKTs, this paper introduces a Shape-conditioned Trajectory Deformation Network (SCTDN) which leverages geometric features of the hanging parts to retrieve and deform template trajectories adapted to novel supporting items. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world, they demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively transfers various objects onto diverse supporting items, surpassing state-of-the-art hanging algorithms in success rate and efficiency. The SKT representation facilitates hanging different objects in an object-agnostic manner. This work provides an interpretable and actionable solution to bridge the perception and action gap for the complex task of hanging objects.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of enabling robots to hang a wide range of grasped objects onto arbitrary supporting items like hooks or racks. This is challenging because both the objects and supports can vary substantially in shape and structure. Key issues are (1) identifying the relevant geometric structures to determine feasible hanging poses, and (2) generating robust action sequences to accommodate shape variations. Prior methods using semantic keypoints or sampling-based planning have limitations in computational efficiency, collision detection, or versatility across objects.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel representation called Semantic Keypoint Trajectory (SKT) to address these challenges. SKT specifies where on the support to hang the object and how to move to achieve hanging. It defines a trajectory for the movement of keypoints on the object relative to the support's frame. A key insight is that SKT can be object-agnostic, allowing the same trajectory for various objects on one support.

To generate SKTs, a Shape-conditioned Trajectory Deformation Network (SCTDN) is introduced. It retrieves and deforms a template SKT based on geometric structure features of the partial point cloud input. This avoids predicting trajectories from scratch. The features focus on the hanging part to capture correlations with the trajectory shape.

Contributions:
- Proposes Semantic Keypoint Trajectory, a versatile representation for robotic hanging of diverse objects on varying supports
- Introduces a learning framework, SCTDN, to efficiently generate trajectories by conditioning trajectory deformation on geometric structures  
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in simulation and promising real robot results
- Shows one trajectory can guide different objects on the same support, enabling object-agnostic hanging

The key impact is enabling more reliable and efficient robotic hanging for practical applications. The object-agnostic representation also facilitates reuse across objects.
