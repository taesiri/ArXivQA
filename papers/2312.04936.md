# [SKT-Hang: Hanging Everyday Objects via Object-Agnostic Semantic Keypoint   Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04936)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key contributions in this paper:

This paper proposes a novel representation called Semantic Keypoint Trajectory (SKT) for enabling robots to hang a wide range of grasped objects onto arbitrary supporting items robustly. SKT simultaneously models the hanging structure on the supporting item and the movements of relevant keypoints on the objects to be hung. To generate SKTs, this paper introduces a Shape-conditioned Trajectory Deformation Network (SCTDN) which leverages geometric features of the hanging parts to retrieve and deform template trajectories adapted to novel supporting items. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world, they demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively transfers various objects onto diverse supporting items, surpassing state-of-the-art hanging algorithms in success rate and efficiency. The SKT representation facilitates hanging different objects in an object-agnostic manner. This work provides an interpretable and actionable solution to bridge the perception and action gap for the complex task of hanging objects.
