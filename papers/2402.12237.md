# [Learning to Defer in Content Moderation: The Human-AI Interplay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12237)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of content moderation in online platforms like social media. Specifically, it considers the collaboration between humans and AI systems in moderating content. The platform needs to quickly remove harmful content while avoiding mistakenly removing benign content. However, relying solely on either humans or AI has limitations - humans have limited review capacity while AI models can be unreliable for complex content. Thus, the paper proposes a framework that combines the responsiveness of AI with the reliability of human reviewers.

Solution:
The paper models the content moderation pipeline as follows. In each time period, a new post arrives which has a contextual feature vector and an unknown "cost" indicating its harmfulness. The platform first makes an automated classification on whether to keep or remove the post. It then decides whether to admit the post into a review queue for human evaluation. Finally, when a human reviewer becomes available, it selects one post from the queue for the human to review, which reveals the true cost of that post. 

The algorithm, termed BALANCED, makes classification, admission and scheduling decisions to minimize total cost by balancing three sources of loss - idiosyncrasy loss from keeping harmful or removing benign posts without review, delay loss from congestion in the review system causing long wait times, and classification loss from incorrectly estimating the harmfulness of unreviewed posts.

When model parameters are known, BALANCED admits posts whose avoided idiosyncrasy loss exceeds the incurred delay loss. For scheduling, it prioritizes posts from types with higher workload. This achieves near optimal average regret that scales as sqrt(maximum lifetime).

When model parameters are unknown, solely using optimistic estimates fails due to the selective sampling nature of human reviews. To address this, BALANCED employs additional label-driven admission and forced scheduling to ensure enough labels for future classification decisions. The full algorithm achieves low average regret even without knowing model parameters.

To avoid dependence on the number of content types, the paper extends BALANCED to a contextual bandit setting. It introduces type aggregation to estimate system congestion and adapts techniques from contextual bandits to handle many contexts. This extension enjoys regret guarantees without dependence on the number of types.

Contributions:
- Proposes a formal model that captures key elements of the human-AI interplay in online content moderation
- Develops algorithm BALANCED that provides performance guarantees by balancing three sources of loss (idiosyncrasy, delay and classification)
- Identifies and addresses fundamental limitations of solely optimism-based approaches 
- Extends model to contextual setting and develops type aggregation and contextual learning techniques to provide scalable guarantees

The model provides useful insights into designing human-AI collaborative systems. The analysis framework may also inspire efficient algorithms in other online learning problems with limited feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an algorithm for online content moderation that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed posts, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a formal model to capture the human-AI interplay in online content moderation, accounting for the need to balance reliability (via human reviews) and responsiveness (via AI automation). The model includes decision components on classification, admission to the human review system, and scheduling of reviews.

2. For the setting where the average harmfulness of content types is known, it develops an algorithm called BACID that carefully balances the tradeoff between avoiding idiosyncratic losses (by admitting more content for human review) and limiting delays (by controlling the load to the human review system). It shows that BACID achieves near-optimal regret compared to an omniscient benchmark.

3. For the setting where the average harmfulness is unknown, it highlights issues with using optimism-only approaches, due to the selective sampling aspect where humans only review content passed on by the AI admission decisions. To address this, it develops an augmented algorithm that adds forced scheduling and label-driven admission on top of optimism, and shows that the regret guarantee nearly matches fundamental lower bounds.

4. It further extends the algorithm and analysis to incorporate contextual information to avoid dependence on the number of content types, through techniques like type aggregation and linear contextual bandits. This results in the first online learning guarantee in contextual queueing systems.

In summary, the paper makes both modeling and algorithmic contributions to capture and optimize complex human-AI interactions under capacity constraints and selective sampling.

- Contextual bandits
- Endogenous delays
- Idiosyncrasy loss
- Delay loss
- Optimism
- Exploration

The paper studies the problem of content moderation and proposes algorithms to balance the tradeoff between relying completely on AI (fast but less reliable) versus relying solely on human reviews (reliable but limited capacity). It models this as a "learning to defer" problem where the AI can choose to defer decisions to human reviewers. A key challenge is accounting for the selective sampling where humans only review posts filtered by the AI. The paper introduces the notions of idiosyncrasy loss and delay loss to capture this tradeoff. It also highlights issues with using optimism-only approaches common in bandit literature and proposes forced exploration to address selective sampling. The paper extends the model and algorithms to incorporate contextual information while avoiding dependence on the number of content types. A technical contribution is providing online learning guarantees for contextual bandits with endogenous delays.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes balancing the idiosyncrasy loss from variance in posts of the same type and the delay loss from admission decisions leading to congestion. What other metrics could be incorporated into this trade-off and how might the admission control policy change? 

2. When the expected costs are unknown, the paper shows optimism-only approaches fail due to selective sampling. Could you propose alternative approaches that retain optimism but address selective sampling, perhaps by directly modeling the sampling process?

3. The paper handles unknown expected costs by balancing optimism-based and label-driven admission. What are other ways the unknown parameters could be handled and how would the performance guarantees compare?

4. The label-driven admission rule aims to improve classification decisions. Could this component be adapted to directly optimize other objectives related to model performance? How might the scheduling priority change?

5. The paper considers a batch scheduling setting. How could the model and analysis extend to handling admissions and scheduling in an online manner? What new challenges arise?

6. For the contextual setting, the paper aggregates types to estimate delay loss. What other approaches could be used for delay loss estimation with many types? How do the performance tradeoffs compare?  

7. The regret bound for the contextual setting scales poorly with lifetimes due to the type aggregation technique. Can you propose alternative type aggregation approaches to improve the dependence on lifetimes?

8. How does selectively sampling the covariates in the contextual setting impact learning? Could an approach that models this selective sampling achieve better dependence on lifetimes? 

9. The paper assumes a simple linear model for the expected costs. How could the method extend to non-linear models while retaining performance guarantees?

10. The paper focuses on stationary expected costs. How could the model and analysis extend to handle concept drift in the expected costs over time?
