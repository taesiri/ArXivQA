# [Single-GPU GNN Systems: Traps and Pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03548)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many recent works on optimizing single-GPU graph neural network (GNN) systems have major pitfalls, including not measuring training accuracy, relying too much on small datasets, and having inefficient or incorrect system designs. 
- These pitfalls lead to questionable speedup claims, overstated performance gains, broken GNN workflows, stifled future innovations, and more.

Proposed Solutions:
- Identify three major categories of pitfalls: missing accuracy measurement (EVAL-P1), framework overhead issues from small datasets (EVAL-P2), and ignoring key baselines/mismatched requirements (EVAL-P3).
- Provide recommendations like enforcing accuracy measurement, using larger datasets, analyzing memory consumption, etc.
- Propose future research directions around studying framework overhead, making invasive fixes to existing systems, and building a reference system.
- Introduce GraphPy, a novel single-GPU GNN system focused on requirement understanding and practicality, with innovations like edge ID reordering and exploiting dataset symmetry.

Contributions:
- First in-depth analysis showing prevalence of critical pitfalls in single-GPU GNN systems and their significant impacts.
- Detailed experiments quantifying pitfalls around accuracy, overhead, memory usage, and performance. 
- Crucial recommendations and future directions for advancing GNN system research.
- GraphPy system with 6.9x lower memory on GCN and 2.3x faster training over DGL, showing the value of correct requirement understanding.
- Demonstration that overlooking pitfalls can severely stifle progress, using GraphPy vs. a pitfall-ridden system.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in identifying, analyzing and mitigating common but severe pitfalls in recent single-GPU GNN systems to enable more robust future innovation.
