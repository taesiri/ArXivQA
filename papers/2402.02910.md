# [DS-MS-TCN: Otago Exercises Recognition with a Dual-Scale Multi-Stage   Temporal Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02910)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) is an important rehabilitation program for older adults to enhance balance and strength and reduce falls risk. However, self-reports to track exercises have limitations. Prior research has tried using wearable sensors for automated OEP recognition but has had limitations in accuracy and robustness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a dual-scale multi-stage temporal convolutional network (DS-MS-TCN) using a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) worn at the waist to recognize OEP exercises.  

- A novel "micro-labeling" approach is introduced - annotating each repetition of an exercise (micro-activity) instead of the whole activity period. This brings less irrelevant variance to the model.

- The DS-MS-TCN has a first stage to classify micro-activities, followed by stages to classify macro-activities (whole exercise periods) and refine them to reduce over-segmentation errors.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates micro-labeling improves model performance for automated activity recognition.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in classifying 4 key OEP exercises using only a single waist-worn IMU, with F1 scores and IoU F1 scores over 80% and 60% respectively.

- Eliminates need for sliding windows and post-processing required in prior work. Generalizes reasonably from lab to at-home settings.

- Provides a new perspective focused on recognizing each exercise repetition to enhance overall automated activity recognition performance.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in advancing automated recognition of rehabilitation exercises by older adults using a novel deep learning approach and micro-labeling technique.
