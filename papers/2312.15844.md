# [Learning-To-Rank Approach for Identifying Everyday Objects Using a   Physical-World Search Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15844)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the task of retrieving target objects from open-vocabulary user instructions in a human-in-the-loop setting, which is defined as the learning-to-rank physical objects (LTRPO) task. For example, given an instruction like "Go to the bathroom with a picture of a wagon. Bring me the towel under the picture directly across from the sink", the model needs to output a ranked list of images of candidate target objects that a user/operator can select from. This is a challenging task due to the complexity of the natural language instructions and the need to retrieve the correct target from hundreds of object images in the environment.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MultiRankIt, a novel approach for the LTRPO task. The key ideas are:

1) Crossmodal Noun Phrase Encoder (CNPE): Handles noun and prepositional phrases from the instruction to model relationship between phrases and target object bounding box. This allows handling complex hierarchical referring expressions. 

2) Crossmodal Region Feature Encoder (CRFE): Handles multiple images of surrounding context to model relationship between target object and wider contextual images.

The method takes the instruction, target bounding boxes and context images as input and outputs a ranked list of target bounding boxes.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes a learning-to-rank approach for multimodal object retrieval in a human-in-the-loop setting. Could be applied to other multimodal retrieval tasks.

2) Introduces CNPE to handle complex noun phrases referring to both target and surrounding objects/environment. More effective at modeling referring expressions.

3) Introduces CRFE to leverage broader context images to model target-context relationships. Provides wider viewpoint beyond target bounding box.

4) Builds a new dataset (LTRRIE) for the LTRPO task with complex expressions and real environment images.

5) Demonstrates improved performance over baseline on LTRRIE dataset. Also shows 80% task success rate in physical experiments.
