# [Divide and not forget: Ensemble of selectively trained experts in   Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10191)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without forgetting previously learned classes. However, most methods rely on a strong feature extractor trained on a large first task or from a pre-trained model. These methods perform poorly when little training data is available upfront. The paper focuses on the more challenging "exemplar-free" setting without storing examples per class. This requires networks to continually learn new features while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of already learned ones.

Method:
The paper proposes SEED (Selection of Experts for Ensemble Diversification), a novel ensemble method for exemplar-free CIL. SEED maintains a fixed set of experts (neural networks). For each new task, only one expert is selected and updated, while the others make predictions but remain fixed. This encourages diversity between experts. Each expert models each class as a multivariate Gaussian distribution in its latent space. The expert with the least overlap of new class distributions is selected for update. During inference, Bayesian predictions are made from all experts and aggregated.   

Contributions:
1) A new method that updates only one expert per task to encourage diversity while limiting forgetting and overhead.

2) A technique to select the optimal expert based on distribution overlap in the latent space, limiting representational drift.

3) State-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets under various CIL splits. Especially effective when limited data is available upfront or with distribution shifts.

4) Analysis showing the stability-plasticity trade-off can be controlled in SEED via the number of experts. More experts improve plasticity.

5) Demonstration that each expert specializes on certain tasks and contributes uniquely to the ensemble predictions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

SEED is a new class-incremental learning method that uses an ensemble of selectively trained experts, where only one expert is updated per task based on minimizing representation drift, in order to increase model plasticity and stability without requiring task identifiers or exemplars.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing SEED, a new exemplar-free class-incremental learning method. SEED uses an ensemble of experts where only one expert is selected and updated for each new task, while the others participate in predictions but remain unchanged. This approach encourages diversity between experts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The paper shows through experiments that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance on several class-incremental learning benchmarks compared to existing methods. A key advantage highlighted is that SEED maintains higher plasticity to continually learn new features when tasks have equal splits or significant distribution shifts, unlike other methods that rely on a strong pretrained feature extractor.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Class-incremental learning (CIL) - The paper focuses on this continual learning scenario where new classes are added incrementally over time.

- Catastrophic forgetting - The tendency of neural networks to forget previously learned knowledge when trained on new tasks, which is a key challenge in CIL. 

- Exemplar-free - The paper proposes a CIL method that does not rely on storing examples from previous tasks, making it more applicable in constrained environments.

- Ensemble model - The SEED method uses an ensemble of multiple expert networks that are selectively trained and combined to improve stability and plasticity. 

- Expert selection - Only a single "optimal" expert is chosen to be trained on each new task using a minimum distribution overlap criterion to limit representational drift.

- Multivariate Gaussians - Each expert models class distributions in its latent space as multivariate Gaussians, which are combined for richer Bayesian classification.

- State-of-the-art performance - Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate SEED achieves superior average incremental accuracy compared to existing CIL techniques.

- Forgetting vs. intransigence tradeoff - Analyzing SEED shows it achieves a better balance of avoiding catastrophic forgetting while retaining plasticity to learn compared to alternative regularization methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel method of selecting only one expert network to update per task. Why is updating a single network preferable to updating all networks? What are the tradeoffs with each approach?

2. The expert selection criteria is based on minimizing the overlap of Gaussian distributions for the new classes in the latent spaces of each expert. Why is minimizing this overlap important? How does it encourage diversity and specialization amongst the experts?

3. Multivariate Gaussian distributions are used to model classes in the latent spaces. What are the advantages of using the full covariance matrix rather than just the diagonal as done in some other methods? How does it allow better characterization of classes?

4. What is the motivation behind employing knowledge distillation as a regularization method when finetuning the selected expert network? How does it balance plasticity and stability? Could other regularization methods be used instead?

5. The inference procedure combines probabilistic predictions from all expert networks using Bayesian model averaging. Why use this approach rather than simply averaging predictions from all networks? What additional benefits does it provide?

6. Ablation studies show that both the multivariate Gaussians and the expert selection criteria are crucial components of the method. Analyze why both elements are needed to achieve the reported performance.

7. How suitable is the proposed method for online, lifelong learning scenarios? What modifications might need to be made to effectively handle new tasks arriving sequentially?

8. The method shares initial layers between experts to limit compute. Analyze the memory/performance tradeoffs associated with the degree of sharing. What guiding principles can be used to set this hyperparameter?

9. Compare and contrast the continual learning properties of the proposed ensemble approach versus single model approaches. What unique advantages does it offer in terms of plasticity and stability?

10. The method performs very well even without a strong feature extractor pretrained on a large dataset. Why does the approach not rely on this pretraining step like many other methods? How does the ensemble architecture contribute to its effectiveness when trained from scratch?
