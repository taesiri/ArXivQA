# [Root Causing Prediction Anomalies Using Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models deployed in production for personalized recommendations can experience performance degradation over time. This manifests as prediction anomalies compared to actual user engagement.
- Causes include concept drift (model staleness), data drifts (changes in input or target distributions) and feature corruptions. 
- Tracing the root cause is challenging due to the scale, dynamism and complexity of these systems. A single feature corruption can cascade and corrupt labels and concepts.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use explainable AI (XAI) to rank features by change in importance between a control time period and anomaly time period.
- Estimate local feature importances (LFIs) using feature ablation and aggregate to global feature importances (GFIs).
- Rank features by shift in GFIs to prioritize triaging. Features with high rank change likely caused the anomaly.
- Triage top features further to mitigate and address underlying issues.

Key Contributions:
- Show XAI can effectively trace root cause of prediction anomalies compared to statistical correlation methods.
- Handle different feature corruption types like value distribution changes, coverage drops and embedding corruptions.
- 100% recall in identifying at least one corrupted feature across 11 simulated cases.
- Approach is model-agnostic, cheap and fast compared to retraining models.
- Deployed system to continuously analyze GFI shifts to enable rapid debugging.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a novel application of XAI for root causing anomalies in complex, continuous production ML systems by tracing features linked to significant shifts in global importance.
