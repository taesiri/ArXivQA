# [Root Causing Prediction Anomalies Using Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models deployed in production for personalized recommendations can experience performance degradation over time. This manifests as prediction anomalies compared to actual user engagement.
- Causes include concept drift (model staleness), data drifts (changes in input or target distributions) and feature corruptions. 
- Tracing the root cause is challenging due to the scale, dynamism and complexity of these systems. A single feature corruption can cascade and corrupt labels and concepts.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use explainable AI (XAI) to rank features by change in importance between a control time period and anomaly time period.
- Estimate local feature importances (LFIs) using feature ablation and aggregate to global feature importances (GFIs).
- Rank features by shift in GFIs to prioritize triaging. Features with high rank change likely caused the anomaly.
- Triage top features further to mitigate and address underlying issues.

Key Contributions:
- Show XAI can effectively trace root cause of prediction anomalies compared to statistical correlation methods.
- Handle different feature corruption types like value distribution changes, coverage drops and embedding corruptions.
- 100% recall in identifying at least one corrupted feature across 11 simulated cases.
- Approach is model-agnostic, cheap and fast compared to retraining models.
- Deployed system to continuously analyze GFI shifts to enable rapid debugging.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a novel application of XAI for root causing anomalies in complex, continuous production ML systems by tracing features linked to significant shifts in global importance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel application of explainable AI for root-causing performance degradation in machine learning models that continuously learn from user data by detecting feature corruptions through analyzing temporal shifts in global feature importance distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is presenting a novel application of explainable AI (XAI) techniques for root-causing performance degradation in machine learning models that learn continuously from user engagement data. 

Specifically, the paper shows how temporal shifts in the global feature importance distribution, obtained by aggregating local feature importances, can effectively isolate the cause of prediction anomalies in such models. This XAI-based approach is shown to have better recall in identifying corrupted features compared to a baseline model-feature correlation method.

The paper also demonstrates this technique on simulated feature corruptions modeling real-world issues like pipeline bugs, as well as a real case of feature corruption that was successfully triaged. Overall, the main contribution is presenting an effective model-agnostic approach leveraging XAI for monitoring complex, continuously trained machine learning systems and root-causing performance issues caused by feature drifts.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel application of explainable AI (XAI) for root-causing performance degradation in machine learning models. Can you elaborate on why traditional statistical approaches for drift detection may not be sufficient in this context? What unique challenges do continuously trained models present?

2. The method relies on estimating local feature importances (LFIs) using feature ablation. What considerations went into choosing an appropriate baseline for this attribution method? How does the choice of baseline affect the ability to compare LFIs between a control and anomaly period?  

3. The LFIs are aggregated to global feature importances (GFIs) in order to explain the global model behavior. What factors were considered when deciding how to sample the set of examples for aggregation? How is the coverage of features handled during this global aggregation?

4. Both positive and negative LFI values are obtained from the feature ablation method. What option was chosen for handling the sign of LFI scores during global aggregation and why? What are the potential downsides of averaging absolute LFI values?

5. The method prioritizes triaging features based on the shift in GFIs between a control and anomaly period. What secondary metrics are also surfaced to the expert during triaging to provide additional context? How do these aid in root causing?

6. Model-feature correlation (MFC) is presented as an alternative approach for feature prioritization. What are its potential advantages and disadvantages compared to the proposed XAI-based approach? How did its performance compare on the simulated corruption cases?  

7. What considerations went into modeling the three broad categories of feature corruptions for evaluating the method? What key insights were gained from the results across these different corruption types?

8. Case 11 explores corruption in sparse-encoded embedding features. How did the GFIs of affected features change from control to anomaly? How was model resilience improved against such corruptions?

9. Continuous monitoring for proactive anomaly detection is explored using sliding windows over GFIs. What key limitation was found with this approach? How can the system still facilitate faster post-hoc root causing?

10. The paper focuses on feature corruptions, but what other model performance issues could likely benefit from such an XAI-based approach? How could the methodology be adapted or expanded to handle such cases?
