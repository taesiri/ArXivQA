# [Combinatorial Client-Master Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for   Task Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11653)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Mobile devices have limited computing capabilities but the demand for computationally intensive applications like video streaming, VR/AR, etc. is increasing. 
- Mobile edge computing (MEC) offloads tasks from mobile devices to MEC servers at the edge of the network to meet the computing demands. However, task offloading comes with challenges due to various constraints like battery life, latency, quality of service needs of devices and limited storage capacity on the servers.  
- Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods for task offloading handle some constraints as penalties in the reward but do not consider server storage capacity constraints. They also suffer from curse of dimensionality by including things like number of subchannels in state/action spaces.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel combinatorial client-master multiagent DRL (CCM_MADRL) algorithm that enables client agents on devices to decide resource requirements and a master agent on server to make combinatorial offloading decisions based on client requirements and server constraints.

- Client agents decide whether to offload and resource allocations for local or MEC processing. Master agent decides which tasks to accept for offloading based on constraints.

- Constraints on devices are penalties in client reward. Channel availability and server storage capacity constraints are considered in master agent's combinatorial action selection.

- Master agent uses per-client Q-learning and modifies MADDPG critic for combinatorial action selection. Client agents trained via TD error feedback from master.

Main Contributions:
- First MADRL algorithm for task offloading that considers server storage capacity besides device constraints.

- Reduces dimensionality by avoiding subchannels in state/actions and instead uses as constraint.

- Novel client-master formulation and combinatorial action selection enables handling mixed constraints.

- Shows superior performance over MADDPG and heuristics that lack combinatorial selection.
