# [DiffImpute: Tabular Data Imputation With Denoising Diffusion   Probabilistic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13863)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Tabular data is crucial for data management and decision making, but often suffers from missing values which limits its utility. 
- Traditional imputation methods have drawbacks like introducing bias, being computationally expensive, or making strong assumptions about missingness patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DiffImpute, a denoising diffusion probabilistic model tailored for tabular data imputation. 
- It is trained on complete tabular datasets, ensuring it can produce credible imputations without compromising data integrity.
- Applicable to Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) and Missing At Random (MAR) settings.

Key Contributions:

1. Proposes DiffImpute, a diffusion model specifically designed for tabular data imputation, with simplified and more stable training than GANs/VAEs.

2. Introduces the Time Step Tokenizer to incorporate temporal order information into four denoising network architectures: MLP, ResNet, Transformer, and U-Net. Evaluates performance of each. 

3. Proposes Harmonization technique to enhance coherence between imputed and observed data by iterative diffusion and denoising during sampling.

4. Develops Impute-DDIM to accelerate sampling while maintaining imputation quality through non-Markovian sampling.

5. Extensive experiments on 7 datasets show DiffImpute with Transformer architecture has best overall performance, outperforming competitors on average ranking and stability across metrics like MSE, Pearson correlation and downstream task accuracy.

In summary, the paper presents a tailored diffusion-based approach for imputing missing tabular data that is simpler, more stable and shows state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives. The introduced techniques provide directions for effectively adapting diffusion models for the tabular domain.
