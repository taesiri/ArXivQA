# [Gaussian-Flow: 4D Reconstruction with Dynamic 3D Gaussian Particle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03431)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Gaussian-Flow, a novel point-based approach for fast dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering from both multi-view and monocular videos. It builds upon recent advancements in point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for efficiency gains. The key innovation is the Dual-Domain Deformation Model (DDDM) which explicitly captures the time-dependent attribute residuals (position, rotation, radiance) of each Gaussian point using a combination of polynomial fitting in the time domain and Fourier series fitting in the frequency domain. This compact representation enables modeling complex deformations over long footage while preserving the fast training and rendering speed of vanilla 3DGS. Additional techniques like adaptive timestamp scaling and motion trajectory regularizations further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with 5x faster training than per-frame 3DGS, 125 FPS rendering, and higher quality novel view synthesis than leading methods on benchmark datasets. The discrete point-based 4D representation also naturally supports editing static and dynamic 3D scenes. Key advantages are fast speed, high quality, and editing flexibility.
