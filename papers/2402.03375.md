# [BetterV: Controlled Verilog Generation with Discriminative Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03375)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits (ICs), there is a need to automate the hardware design process. Writing hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog is time-consuming and error-prone. Recent works have used large language models (LLMs) for Verilog generation but they lack in incorporating syntactic/functional correctness during training and fail to address key downstream electronic design automation (EDA) tasks that should evaluate the generated Verilog.

Solution - BetterV Framework:
1) Collects and processes abundant Verilog data from open-source. Uses instruct-tuning to teach LLMs domain knowledge e.g. Verilog-C translation, Verilog autocompletion.

2) Further enriches data via augmentation and prepares labels to train downstream task-specific generative discriminators.

3) Trains the discriminator with a hybrid generative-discriminative loss. Then guides LLM's Verilog generation via weighted decoding that incorporates discriminator's predictions.

Key Contributions:
1) Pioneers controlled Verilog generation for optimizing downstream EDA tasks. Opens up an innovative direction for engineering optimization using LLMs.

2) First downstream task-driven method for Verilog generation. Experiments with various discriminators demonstrate remarkable effectiveness e.g. synthesizable Verilog with reduced nodes.

3) Without prompt-engineering, generates functionally correct Verilog outperforming GPT-4 on VerilogEval-machine benchmark.

4) Provides a versatile data augmentation solution tailored to diverse Verilog specifications. Addresses data scarcity effectively.

Overall, BetterV allows optimizing the Verilog implementation for critical downstream EDA tasks through its instruct-tuning and tailored discriminative guidance. It is a promising and pioneering technique for automating hardware design flows with LLMs.
