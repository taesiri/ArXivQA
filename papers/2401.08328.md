# [Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics: Combatting Label Temporal   Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08328)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Test-time batch normalization (BN) methods assume test batches are i.i.d. sampled concerning labels. This assumption is violated in real-world scenarios like autonomous driving where test streams exhibit temporal correlation.
- Existing methods fail under such non-i.i.d conditions as they produce biased batch statistics, jeopardizing system stability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new test-time normalization scheme called UnMix-TNS that is robust to label temporal correlations.

- Key idea: Decompose stored BN statistics into $K$ components at initialization. These components represent statistics from similar instances. 

- At test time, update these components using closest instances from the non-i.i.d. test batch in an online manner.

- For each test instance, compute instance-specific statistics. Mix these with the $K$ components to obtain unbiased normalization statistics for the instance.

- The mixing proportions and subsequent component updates depend on the similarity of each component to the instance. 

Main Contributions:

- UnMix-TNS allows state-of-the-art TTA methods to be robust to temporal correlations, improving performance.

- UnMix-TNS is versatile - works for single/continual adaptation, small batches, even individual samples.

- UnMix-TNS has negligible computational overhead but boosts accuracy substantially.

- Extensive experiments validate UnMix-TNS's efficacy over strong baselines on corruption, natural shifts and new corrupted video benchmarks. UnMix-TNS advances SOTA results.

In summary, the paper makes a seminal contribution in designing specialized test-time normalization layers to overcome biases from label temporal correlations, unlocking stability and performance gains for TTA methods in practical non-i.i.d. settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces UnMix-TNS, a new test-time normalization method designed to handle non-i.i.d. test batches with temporally correlated labels by unmixing stored batch normalization statistics into distinguishable components and updating them using an online clustering-based approach to simulate an i.i.d. environment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new test-time normalization scheme called "UnMixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS). Specifically:

- UnMix-TNS is designed to handle test data streams with temporal correlation between sample labels, which violates the common i.i.d. assumption and causes issues for many existing methods. 

- It works by unmixing the stored batch normalization statistics into multiple components and updating them online based on assignment probabilities to current test samples. This results in more reliable statistics estimation.

- UnMix-TNS demonstrates significant improvements in stability and performance over existing methods when dealing with non-i.i.d. test scenarios across multiple image classification benchmarks.

- It can easily integrate into existing architectures and test-time adaptation techniques as a drop-in replacement for standard batch normalization layers.

In summary, the key innovation is the unmixing procedure and online statistics components update to enable more effective test-time batch normalization under non-i.i.d. conditions with temporal label correlation.
