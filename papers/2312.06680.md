# [Perceptual Similarity guidance and text guidance optimization for   Editing Real Images using Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06680)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for editing real images using text-guided diffusion models can sometimes generate images that differ too much from the original image. There is a need to better preserve similarity to the original image in the unedited regions.

Proposed Solution:  
- Apply a dual-guidance approach during diffusion sampling to enhance consistency with the original image:
  1) Text guidance optimization: Make predictions using 3 text embeddings - unconditional, original image prompt, and edited prompt. Apply weights to balance impact of edited text while retaining similarity to original image.
  2) Perceptual similarity guidance: During diffusion reversal steps, decode latent vectors back to image domain. Use perceptual similarity metric to compute pixel-level difference between edited image and real image. Use this to guide and optimize latent vectors.

Main Contributions:
- Novel method to provide both text-guidance and perceptual similarity guidance during diffusion sampling to enable precise real image editing
- Text guidance optimization: Involves making conditional predictions using multiple text embeddings with balanced weighting schemes  
- Perceptual similarity guidance: Employs perceptual similarity metric to quantify image-space differences between generated and real images during diffusion reversal. Uses this to further refine the latent guidance.
- Evaluations demonstrate method is effective at preserving similarity of unedited regions while accurately incorporating edits directed by text guidance
- Approach enables intuitive real image editing with enhanced consistency compared to prior arts

In summary, the key innovation is a dual guidance approach using both optimized text conditioning and perceptual similarity metrics to achieve more control and similarity during real image editing with text-guided diffusion models. Both image-space and latent-space guidance are employed.
