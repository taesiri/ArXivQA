# [Mining multi-modal communication patterns in interaction with   explainable and non-explainable robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14634)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is little knowledge about human communication patterns when interacting with explainable (robots that explain their actions) versus non-explainable robots (robots that do not explain their actions). 
- Such knowledge is important for designing explainable robots that can adapt their behavior to improve understandability for humans.

Methods:
- 20 humans played a board game with either an explainable or non-explainable Pepper robot, instructing it to move pieces on the board. 
- The interactions were video recorded and manually annotated for verbal utterances, gestures, etc from both the human and robot. 
- The annotations were transformed into 295 transactions for association rule mining to find patterns.

Key Results:
- Humans tended to mirror the robot's choice of communication modality (verbal, gesture, or no feedback). 
- A strong correlation found between male users and non-explainable robots; and female users and explainable robots.
- Men reacted verbally to non-explainable verbal robots, women reacted verbally to explainable verbal robots.
- Humans provide no feedback when interacting with an explainable robot that executes an instruction.
- Lack of human feedback doesn't necessarily signal non-understanding.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated using association rules to investigate contextualized human behavior patterns in HRI. 
- Showed importance of contextualizing human behavior when analyzing HRI.
- Discovered statistically significant multi-modal communication patterns between humans and explainable/non-explainable robots.
- Provided new insights to inform the design of explainable robots that can adapt behavior to improve understandability.

In summary, the paper used an innovative methodology to uncover noteworthy context-dependent communication patterns between humans and robots with different explainability capabilities. The discoveries contribute to the area of explainable AI and can help guide robot designers towards improved human-robot understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates multi-modal human-robot interaction patterns using association rule mining on annotations of videos of humans playing a game with explainable and non-explainable Pepper robots, finding significant gender differences and evidence of humans mirroring the robot's modality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates multi-modal communication patterns in humans interacting with explainable and non-explainable robots. It analyzes videos of 20 human participants playing a board game and verbally instructing either an explainable or non-explainable Pepper robot to move pieces on the board. The analysis uses association rule mining on the video annotations to discover patterns in the human-robot interaction. 

The key findings and contributions are:

1) There are significant gender differences in interaction patterns. Men tend to react verbally to non-explainable verbal robots, while women react verbally to explainable verbal robots. 

2) Humans mirror the robot's choice of modality (verbal, gesture, no feedback) in their own feedback.

3) Lack of human feedback does not necessarily signal non-understanding - humans provide no feedback when interacting with an explainable robot that executes their instruction.

4) The paper demonstrates the utility of association rule mining for discovering contextualized human behavior patterns in human-robot interaction. This allows investigation without predefined hypotheses and highlights the importance of contextualizing human behavior.

In summary, the main contribution is the discovery and analysis of multi-modal communication patterns between humans and explainable/non-explainable robots using association rule mining on annotated interaction videos.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper contents, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper include:

- Explainable robots
- Non-explainable robots 
- Human-robot interaction (HRI)
- Communication patterns
- Multi-modal interaction
- Association rule mining
- Video annotation
- Gender effects
- Robot feedback modalities (verbal, gesture, none)
- Human feedback modalities (verbal, gesture, none)

The paper investigates human communication patterns when interacting with explainable and non-explainable robots. It uses association rule mining on annotated video data to discover patterns in the multi-modal interactions, focusing on verbal, gesture, and no feedback behaviors from both the humans and robots. The results reveal some statistically significant gender effects in how men and women react to explainable vs non-explainable robots. Overall, the key terms revolve around human-robot interaction, communication modalities, explainability, and computational analysis of behavioral patterns.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper uses association rule mining to analyze human-robot interaction patterns. What are the key advantages of using this technique over more traditional statistical methods? How does it allow for discovering contextualized patterns?

2. The paper constrains the consequent in the association rules to three possible human feedback modalities (verbal, gesture, none). What is the rationale behind only allowing these three modalities and not including other possible ones like facial expressions or body posture? 

3. What role does "lift" play in determining interesting association rules describing human-robot interaction patterns? Why is lift used rather than just confidence or support alone?

4. The minimum support threshold for generating association rules is set at 3% in this study. What factors need to be considered in setting the minimum support and how might changing this threshold impact the patterns discovered?

5. How exactly are the video annotations and transcriptions transformed into transactions suitable for association rule mining? What information is captured and encoded for each transaction?

6. The paper finds gender effects in human communication patterns when interacting with explainable versus non-explainable robots. What explanations could account for these differences? How might they shape human-robot interaction design?

7. What role could sequence mining play in extending the analysis to take into account the ordering and evolution of interaction patterns over time rather than just sets of co-occurring items?  

8. How well would the discovered association rules generalize to human interactions with other types of robots and tasks beyond the game playing scenario studied here? What cross-validation approaches could be used?

9. What other contextual factors beyond gender and robot explainability could be relevant to encode and analyze in terms of their impacts on human communication modalities during HRI?

10. How can the multi-modal interaction patterns discovered using association rule mining be leveraged to design adaptive robot behaviors that take into account and respond appropriately to human communication signals?
