# [Masked Autoencoding Does Not Help Natural Language Supervision at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07836)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is:

Does combining self-supervision with natural language supervision lead to better visual representations compared to using either approach alone?

Specifically, the authors investigate whether adding a masked autoencoding objective (self-supervision) to a contrastive language-image pretraining approach (CLIP) results in improved performance on downstream vision tasks. They test this in both a "low-sample" regime with 11.3 million training examples and a "high-sample" regime with 1.4 billion examples. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that the additional self-supervision signal from masked autoencoding should complement the natural language supervision and lead to better representations. The authors test whether this hypothesis holds true, especially when scaling up to the massive datasets commonly used for pretraining vision models.

In summary, the key question is whether self-supervision helps natural language supervision for visual representation learning, particularly in the high-data regime relevant to state-of-the-art models. The authors evaluate this through careful experiments combining CLIP and MAE objectives.
