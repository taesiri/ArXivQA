# [Ouroboros: Speculative Decoding with Large Model Enhanced Drafting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Autoregressive decoding of large language models (LLMs) is very slow for inference. 
- Existing drafting-then-verifying methods have two key limitations: (1) Insufficient draft length, as longer drafts have high error costs but more potential for acceleration. (2) Underutilization of verification results, as only the verified prefix is used while subsequent tokens are discarded.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Ouroboros, a new drafting-then-verifying decoding method.
- It uses a smaller model to generate drafts, and the target LLM to verify drafts and provide candidate inspirations to enhance future drafts. 
- Several key ideas:
   - Generate drafts at phrase level from a shared candidate pool to allow longer drafts.
   - Construct multiple draft candidates by concatenating 1 draft prefix and multiple suffix candidates.
   - Parallel verify multiple candidates in one pass using custom attention masking.
   - Use both verified and discarded verification tokens to generate new candidate inspirations and refinements.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first decoding method that uses the target LLM to enhance the drafting phase via candidate inspirations and refinements.
- Achieves up to 1.9x and 2.8x speedup over prior works Lookahead Decoding and Speculative Decoding.
- Completely training-free and lossless in terms of task performance.
- Demonstrates effectiveness on multiple language tasks like code generation, summarization and translation.

In summary, Ouroboros is an efficient drafting-then-verifying decoding method that can accelerate LLM inference significantly without accuracy loss or expensive training. Its key novelty is a bidirectional acceleration strategy - using the target LLM to speed up and improve the draft generation phase.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Ouroboros, a drafting-then-verifying decoding method that uses a shared phrase candidate pool and bidirectional model enhancement between a small draft model and large target model to generate longer, higher-quality drafts for more efficient large language model inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Ouroboros, a new decoding method for efficiently accelerating the inference of large language models. Specifically:

1) Ouroboros introduces a phrase candidate pool shared between the target model and the draft model to facilitate more efficient draft generation at the phrase level rather than token level. 

2) Ouroboros makes full use of the verification results, including both verified and discarded tokens, to generate candidate inspirations to enhance the phrase candidate pool and further improve draft generation.

3) Ouroboros achieves significantly faster decoding speeds without any loss in task performance or quality compared to prior methods like greedy decoding, lookahead decoding, and speculative decoding. The experiments show Ouroboros can provide up to 1.9x speedup over lookahead decoding and 2.8x over speculative decoding.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel Ouroboros decoding algorithm that can efficiently accelerate inference for large language models through more effective draft generation and full utilization of verification results.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Ouroboros - The name of the proposed decoding framework. It refers to a serpent eating its own tail, symbolizing the bidirectional acceleration between the target model and drafting model. 

- Drafting-then-verifying - The high-level decoding strategy where a draft is first quickly generated and then verified by the target model. This allows parallel and faster decoding.

- Speculative decoding - An existing drafting-then-verifying decoding method that uses a smaller model to generate drafts.

- Lookahead decoding - Another existing drafting-then-verifying method that uses n-gram pools to generate drafts.

- Candidate pool - A pool of phrase candidates maintained in Ouroboros to help with draft generation.

- Candidate inspiration - A technique in Ouroboros to make use of discarded verification results to enhance the candidate pool. 

- Candidate refinement - Another Ouroboros technique to use the verification results to update candidates in the pool.

- Warm start - Using a pre-filled candidate pool from a related task to provide better initialization.

Some other potentially relevant terms are autoregressive decoding, attention masking, verification, drafting, context locality, lossless acceleration.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Ouroboros utilize the phrase candidate pool to generate longer and higher quality drafts compared to prior decoding methods? What are the key innovations here?

2. The paper claims Ouroboros makes full use of the verification results. How specifically does it utilize both the verified and discarded tokens from the verification phase? What is the intuition behind this? 

3. Explain the candidate inspiration and refinement mechanisms in detail. How do these help to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the initial drafts?

4. What motivated the design choice to conduct drafting at the phrase level rather than the token level in Ouroboros? What are the tradeoffs here? 

5. How does the customized attention masking in Ouroboros allow verifying multiple draft candidates in a single pass of the target model? Why is this important?

6. What is the role of context locality and warm start in accelerating decoding? How was this realized in Ouroboros and why is it impactful? 

7. What are the limitations of prior drafting-then-verifying decoding methods that Ouroboros aims to address? Elaborate.  

8. The paper claims generating longer drafts can lead to more significant speedups but also higher error costs. How does Ouroboros balance this tradeoff?

9. What choices were made in designing the phrase candidate pool in Ouroboros? How are phrases added, selected, expired from this pool? What impacts this design?

10. The paper compares Ouroboros against strong baselines on multiple datasets. What were the biggest empirical wins observed? What explanations are provided for cases where gains were more modest?
