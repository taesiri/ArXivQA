# [Impact-Aware Bimanual Catching of Large-Momentum Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the challenging task of dual-arm robots catching large-momentum objects whose motion lasts less than one second and that move with speeds exceeding 3.5 m/s. Such highly dynamic manipulation tasks inevitably involve impacts when making contact, which can lead to unstable contacts, bouncing of the object, or even irreversible damage. To enable robots to smoothly catch such fast-moving objects, the key challenges are: (1) accurately estimating and predicting the motion of the object, (2) selecting optimal contact locations on the object's surface to minimize impulsive forces, (3) coordinating the motions and stiffness profiles of the two robot arms, and (4) precisely tracking desired motions and forces during the impact event.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an optimization framework comprising modules for motion estimation, trajectory prediction, impact-aware contact selection, multi-mode trajectory optimization, variable stiffness control, and indirect force control. Specifically:

- An extended Kalman filter rapidly estimates the object's velocity. Then a constrained trajectory optimization predicts the object's future trajectory.  

- They introduce impact modelling to analyze impulses and propose principles for selecting impact-resistant contacts. This led to a contact optimization method based on sequential quadratic programming.

- A multi-mode trajectory optimization (MMTO) method is used to generate coordinated dual-arm motions, optimized stiffness profiles and force tracking setpoints to minimize impacts.

- An indirect force controller tracks the desired motions and contact forces through the impact transition.

Contributions:
The key contributions are:

- Contact selection principles and optimization algorithms that enable online selection of multiple contact locations and directions on arbitrarily shaped objects for impact mitigation

- Extending their prior MMTO formulation to multi-contact 3D scenarios involving transitions between free motion, single arm motion and coordinated dual arm motion

- Experimental validation, including smoothly catching tumbling objects swinging from the ceiling and thrown flying objects at speeds exceeding 3.5m/s.

The proposed methods effectively coordinate the motion, force and stiffness profiles of the two arms to minimize impacts when catching objects moving at high speeds. This is the first optimization-based system demonstrated to catch flying objects with dual-arm robots.
