# [PEEKABOO: Interactive Video Generation via Masked-Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07509)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Peekaboo, a training-free method to add spatio-temporal control to off-the-shelf video generation models based on latent diffusion. Peekaboo works by using masked attention to guide the model to generate desired objects in specific locations across frames. It introduces separate attention masks in the cross-, self-, and temporal attention layers to isolate foreground and background generation for several initial diffusion steps, after which free generation allows integration. This attention masking enables explicit spatial control over object size, location and movement without retraining models or increasing inference latency. The method is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively on two new datasets introduced in the paper for measuring spatio-temporal control, showing significant improvements in metrics like mIoU and AP50 over baseline models. Ablations reveal the importance of each masking component. The approach also improves video quality and alleviates some common failure cases of text-to-video models. Its zero-training property allows easy adoption with different base models. Limitations include mismatches between user masking and model priors. Overall, Peekaboo enables interactive video editing by giving end users spatial and temporal control over generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Peekaboo, a training-free method to add spatio-temporal control to off-the-shelf video diffusion models through masked attention, enabling interactive video generation where users can control object size, location, and motion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a training-free method called "Peekaboo" to endow off-the-shelf video diffusion models with spatial and temporal control over their output. Specifically:

1) The paper introduces a novel spatio-temporal masked attention module called "Peekaboo" that can be added to any UNet-based video diffusion model. This module enables user control over the size, location, and motion of objects in the generated video.

2) The "Peekaboo" method is training-free, meaning it does not require re-training the base video diffusion model. It also has no inference overhead or added latency. This makes it easy to apply to existing models.

3) The paper proposes a benchmark and two new datasets (ssv2-ST and Interactive Motion Control) to evaluate interactive video generation methods on their spatio-temporal control ability.

4) Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that "Peekaboo" can provide significant improvement in spatial and temporal control over baseline models, with gains of up to 3.8x in mIoU.

In summary, the key novelty is a training-free module to add user control to video generation, along with appropriate evaluation benchmarks. The method and analysis open up new directions for controlled and interactive video synthesis.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes using local context for generating individual objects instead of global context. What is the intuition behind this design choice? How does it help achieve better spatial control over video generation?

2) The paper draws inspiration from works in segmentation like MaskFormer and Mask2Former. What key ideas are borrowed from these segmentation methods and how are they adapted for the video generation task?

3) What are the different types of attention masking introduced - masked cross attention, masked spatial attention, and masked temporal attention? Explain the specific purpose and functionality of each of these. 

4) Walk through the computations involved in generating each of the three attention masks. What are the key mathematical operations? How do these masks help impart control?

5) The method proposes 'free generation' after a certain number of masked diffusion steps 't'. Explain why this is an important component and how it helps further improve video quality?

6) How exactly does the addition of these masked attention modules impart spatial and temporal control over video generation? Explain in detail.

7) The paper claims no additional inference latency is incurred by this method. Why is this the case? Does it involve any tradeoffs?

8) The paper demonstrates applicability of the method for image generation as well. What modifications need to be made to adapt it for the image case?

9) What are some limitations of the current approach proposed? Where does it still fail to produce high quality controllable outputs?

10) The paper proposes automated mask generation using large language models like GPT-4. What are the advantages of such an automated pipeline? How does video quality compare when using this?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent text-to-video generation models can produce high quality and diverse videos from text descriptions. However, these models lack interactivity and user control over the generated video's spatial and temporal aspects like object size, location, pose etc. Providing such control can enable new creative applications. Training new models for this task requires large amounts of resources and grounded data. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Peekaboo, a training-free module to provide spatial and temporal control over off-the-shelf video diffusion models. Peekaboo uses ideas from segmentation literature to guide the model's attention to mask out foreground and background regions from each other initially before allowing free generation. This is done by computing spatial, temporal and cross-attention masks based on the input bounding box that force the foreground and background pixels to attend within their own regions only.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Peekaboo, a zero-training method to control off-the-shelf video diffusion models spatio-temporally using bounding box inputs.
- Introduces no additional latency during inference.
- Versatile to apply to any UNet based model including images.
- Proposes a benchmark for evaluating interactive control by filtering and annotating the Something-Something dataset (ssv2-ST) and collecting custom prompts (Interactive Motion Control dataset).
- Demonstrates upto 3.8x gain in mean IoU over baselines on ssv2-ST and qualitative examples of spatial and temporal control over objects.
- Shows Peekaboo can overcome some fundamental failures of baseline models.
- Provides extensive ablative analysis of design choices.

In summary, this paper explores the novel task of interactive video generation by proposing Peekaboo that can control off-the-shelf video diffusion models spatio-temporally without re-training them.
