# [PerSival: Neural-network-based visualisation for pervasive   continuum-mechanical simulations in musculoskeletal biomechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03957)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel workflow combining sparse grid interpolation and deep learning to enable real-time visualization of biomechanical simulations of muscle deformation. A high-fidelity finite element model of the upper limb is used to generate training data, but is too computationally expensive to run in real-time. A sparse grid surrogate interpolates the finite element data to generate approximations much faster. This sparse grid data then trains a dense neural network to predict muscle deformation based on muscle activation levels. The neural network achieves high accuracy, with average errors of 0.97mm and 0.57% compared to the sparse grid, while enabling real-time visualization speeds of over 100 fps. This allows realistic muscle deformations to be visualized in applications like augmented reality and virtual reality using standard hardware, bringing detailed biomechanical simulations out of the realm of supercomputers. The workflow provides a generalizable approach to making continuum mechanical simulations accessible for real-time interactive applications across fields.
