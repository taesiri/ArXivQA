# [FedPerfix: Towards Partial Model Personalization of Vision Transformers   in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09160)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we perform partial model personalization for Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the context of federated learning to improve performance on heterogeneous client data distributions?The key points related to this question are:- Previous work on partial model personalization in federated learning has focused on CNNs, leaving a gap for understanding how to apply it to ViTs.- ViTs have shown great success in centralized training, suggesting their potential benefits for federated learning. But how to best leverage ViTs in personalized federated learning is still an open question. - The paper empirically evaluates the sensitivity of different ViT components to data distribution shifts. This indicates the self-attention layers and classification head as most crucial for personalization.- The paper proposes a novel method called FedPerfix that adapts prefix tuning to personalize the sensitive ViT components while still leveraging global model information. - Experiments demonstrate FedPerfix achieves state-of-the-art performance for ViT-based personalized federated learning across diverse datasets.In summary, the central hypothesis is that selectively personalizing the self-attention layers and classification head of ViTs using techniques adapted from prefix tuning can improve performance on heterogeneous client data in federated learning. The paper provides empirical analysis to identify the sensitive components of ViTs and proposes the FedPerfix method to address this question.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring different transformer architectures and larger model sizes for federated learning. The authors used the Vision Transformer (ViT) in their experiments, but suggest trying other transformer models like Swin Transformers as well as larger variants of ViT to see if further improvements can be achieved.- Applying the proposed FedPerfix approach to other domains beyond computer vision, such as natural language processing tasks. The authors focused their evaluation on image classification but suggest their method could generalize to other data types and tasks.- Investigating other potential components of transformers that could benefit from partial personalization besides the self-attention and classification head layers. The paper studied those two components but notes there may be other parts of transformers sensitive to data distribution that could be personalized.- Analyzing the theoretical connections between personalized federated learning and transfer learning more formally. The authors draw an analogy between the two areas and use techniques from transfer learning, but suggest more rigorous analysis of the connections could be beneficial.- Evaluating the proposed approach under more challenging federated learning scenarios with a larger number of clients and more extreme forms of data heterogeneity. The experiments used up to 128 clients but larger scales could reveal more insights.- Comparing personalized federated learning for transformers and CNNs more thoroughly. The authors provide some comparison but suggest more in-depth analysis of when transformers offer benefits over CNNs could help guide model selection.In summary, the main directions are exploring different transformer models and architectures, applying the approach to other domains and tasks, identifying other components to personalize, formal analysis of connections to transfer learning, and more extensive evaluations under challenging federated learning settings. The authors lay good groundwork but highlight many opportunities for future work in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents a novel method called FedPerfix for partial model personalization of vision transformers in federated learning. Federated learning enables decentralized training on heterogeneous client data without directly sharing the raw data. However, data heterogeneity poses challenges. Personalized federated learning aims to train client-specific models to deal with data heterogeneity. Partial model personalization selectively updates a subset of model parameters locally instead of the entire model to improve efficiency. The paper first conducts an empirical study on vision transformers (ViTs) to determine the most sensitive layers to data distribution, finding the self-attention layers and classification head are most crucial. Then it proposes FedPerfix which leverages prefix networks from transfer learning as plugins to personalize the self-attention layers. Specifically, learnable prefixes are appended to the self-attention layers and updated locally while the original layers are aggregated normally. This allows transferring knowledge from the global model while capturing client-specific information. Evaluations on image classification datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and efficiency of FedPerfix compared to advanced personalized federated learning methods. The work provides insights into personalizing ViTs and introduces a novel approach to personalized attention layers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel approach called FedPerfix for performing partial model personalization of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the context of federated learning. Federated learning allows training machine learning models on decentralized data located on different clients without directly sharing the raw data. However, data heterogeneity across clients poses challenges. Personalized federated learning aims to train client-specific models to accommodate such heterogeneity. Previous work has focused on personalizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), while little attention has been paid to ViTs despite their superior performance on various vision tasks. The key contribution of this work is the proposal of FedPerfix, which leverages prefix tuning to personalize the self-attention layers of a ViT model. Specifically, the paper first empirically evaluates the sensitivity of different ViT components to identify the self-attention layers and classification head as the most crucial parts to personalize. FedPerfix then introduces trainable prefixes, a technique from transfer learning, to capture client-specific information and adapt the aggregated self-attention layers to each client's local distribution. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that FedPerfix outperforms existing personalized federated learning methods for ViTs, while also reducing resource requirements. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into personalizing ViTs and introduces a novel approach that transfers insights from transfer learning to the federated learning context.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach called FedPerfix for partial model personalization of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in federated learning. FedPerfix selectively personalizes the self-attention layers and classification head of a ViT, which are identified as the most sensitive parts to data distribution through an empirical study. It leverages the idea of prefix tuning from transfer learning to capture client-specific knowledge and adapt the aggregated global model to each client's local data distribution. Specifically, learnable prefix parameters are appended to the keys and values of the self-attention layers and kept updated locally on each client. The original self-attention layers are still aggregated globally to capture cross-client dependencies. In this way, FedPerfix enables transferring knowledge from the global model while personalizing the most crucial components for each client. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to previous personalized federated learning methods.
