# [Visual Spatial Attention and Proprioceptive Data-Driven Reinforcement   Learning for Robust Peg-in-Hole Task Under Variable Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16438)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Anchor-bolt insertion in construction is a challenging peg-in-hole task to automate due to variable lighting conditions that cause issues for visual detection, as well as variable hole surface conditions. Prior methods using force/torque feedback avoid visual issues but require long execution times. Visual methods struggle in variable lighting. Fast sim-to-real methods are hard due to difficulty simulating concrete surface friction accurately.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new model called SAP-RL-E that integrates a Spatial Attention Point network (SAP) with a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policy network. The SAP extracts task-relevant keypoints from images even in poor lighting. The integrated DRL policy uses these points to generate robot motions. The networks are trained jointly end-to-end, enabling the SAP to provide points useful for the policy. 

An offline training framework is also proposed to minimize reality gap. It only extracts small amounts of real data around a hole to create a "hole map", which is used to train models instead of the real robot, avoiding long online training.

Main Contributions:

- Modification of a Spatial Attention Point network to extract visually salient points without needing recurrent layers

- An integrated network with the SAP connected to a DRL policy network, enabling joint end-to-end training for task-specific attention points

- Evaluation of the SAP on images with misleading shadows, demonstrating attention capability 

- An offline framework to train models on real but minimal data from hole maps to reduce reality gap and training time

- Demonstration that the proposed SAP-RL-E model outperforms other baselines in completion rate and time on real robot experiments, even under poor lighting and starting farther from holes.

In summary, the proposed approach contributes an efficient visual attention-based model and data-efficient offline training methodology to enable automated anchor bolt insertion under challenging construction conditions.
