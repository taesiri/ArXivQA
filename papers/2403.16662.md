# [RU22Fact: Optimizing Evidence for Multilingual Explainable Fact-Checking   on Russia-Ukraine Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16662)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fact-checking systems rely on high-quality evidence to verify claims and generate explanations. However, obtaining both sufficient and relevant evidence is a challenge. Search engine results often lack enough information or contain irrelevant details.

Solution: 
- The authors propose an LLMs-driven method to automatically retrieve and summarize documents from the web to produce "optimized evidence" - evidence that is more focused and informative for fact-checking.

- They construct a new multilingual dataset called RU22Fact with over 16K real-world claims on the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Each sample has a claim, optimized evidence from the web, a referenced explanation, labels, etc.

- They build an end-to-end explainable fact-checking system with modules for evidence optimization, claim verification, and explanation generation. It serves as a baseline for the new dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing optimized evidence can improve fact-checking performance compared to typical search engine results 

- RU22Fact - A large multilingual dataset for explainable fact-checking with real claims and optimized evidence 

- An end-to-end fact-checking system that verifies claims and generates explanations based on the optimized evidence

- Experimental results demonstrating the promise of optimized evidence and establishing baseline performance on claim verification and explanation tasks on the new dataset

The paper shows the potential for optimized evidence to enhance fact-checking systems. The new dataset and end-to-end system provide a valuable benchmark for further progress on explainable automated fact-checking.
