# [RU22Fact: Optimizing Evidence for Multilingual Explainable Fact-Checking   on Russia-Ukraine Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16662)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fact-checking systems rely on high-quality evidence to verify claims and generate explanations. However, obtaining both sufficient and relevant evidence is a challenge. Search engine results often lack enough information or contain irrelevant details.

Solution: 
- The authors propose an LLMs-driven method to automatically retrieve and summarize documents from the web to produce "optimized evidence" - evidence that is more focused and informative for fact-checking.

- They construct a new multilingual dataset called RU22Fact with over 16K real-world claims on the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Each sample has a claim, optimized evidence from the web, a referenced explanation, labels, etc.

- They build an end-to-end explainable fact-checking system with modules for evidence optimization, claim verification, and explanation generation. It serves as a baseline for the new dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing optimized evidence can improve fact-checking performance compared to typical search engine results 

- RU22Fact - A large multilingual dataset for explainable fact-checking with real claims and optimized evidence 

- An end-to-end fact-checking system that verifies claims and generates explanations based on the optimized evidence

- Experimental results demonstrating the promise of optimized evidence and establishing baseline performance on claim verification and explanation tasks on the new dataset

The paper shows the potential for optimized evidence to enhance fact-checking systems. The new dataset and end-to-end system provide a valuable benchmark for further progress on explainable automated fact-checking.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an LLM-driven method to optimize evidence retrieval for explainable multilingual fact-checking, constructs a novel dataset RU22Fact on Russia-Ukraine conflict, and develops an end-to-end explainable fact-checking system to establish baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing an LLMs-driven method to automatically retrieve and summarize documents from the Web to produce optimized evidence for fact-checking. The authors are the first to explore optimized evidence in fact-checking systems.

2. Constructing RU22Fact, a novel multilingual explainable fact-checking dataset with 16K real-world claims related to the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. The dataset includes optimized evidence to support end-to-end claim verification and human-understandable explanation generation.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a method to optimize evidence for fact-checking using large language models, and constructing a new multilingual dataset for explainable fact-checking with optimized evidence.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Fact-checking - The main task that is the focus of the paper, i.e. verifying the factuality of claims.

- Evidence - A critical component in fact-checking systems. The paper analyzes and optimizes evidence for fact-checking.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper proposes using LLMs to optimize evidence retrieval and summarization for fact-checking.

- Multilinguality - The constructed fact-checking dataset and system supports multiple languages: English, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian.

- Russia-Ukraine conflict - The real-world claims in the constructed dataset are related to the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict.

- Coherence properties - Three desirable properties (strong global coherence, weak global coherence, local coherence) used to evaluate the quality of generated explanations.

So in summary, the key terms cover fact-checking, evidence optimization, explainability, LLMs, multilinguality, Russia-Ukraine conflict, coherence properties.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an LLMs-driven method to automatically retrieve and summarize documents from the Web to produce optimized evidence. What are the key steps in this method and how does it differ from prior approaches to evidence retrieval for fact-checking?

2. What prompted the authors to explore optimized evidence for fact-checking systems? What analysis did they conduct to demonstrate the value of optimized evidence?

3. The paper constructs a new multilingual explainable fact-checking dataset called RU22Fact. What are some key properties and statistics of this dataset? How does it compare to prior fact-checking datasets?  

4. The paper frames fact-checking as an end-to-end task comprising claim verification and explanation generation. What are the motivations for this formulation compared to traditional pipeline approaches? What are the challenges?

5. Explain in detail the model architecture and training strategies used for the claim verification module in the fact-checking system. What design choices were made and why?

6. Explain in detail the model architecture and training strategies used for the explanation generation module. How does the model ensure that the generated text is truthful and aligned with the predicted label? 

7. The paper conducts both automated metrics-based evaluation and human evaluation for the explanation generation module. Compare and contrast the insights obtained from both. What are limitations of automated metrics for this task?

8. The paper identifies three coherence properties that high-quality explanations should satisfy - strong global coherence, weak global coherence and local coherence. Provide definitions and examples of each property. 

9. The authors utilize natural language inference models to computationally evaluate the coherence properties. How well did these models approximate human judgements of coherence? Where were the gaps?

10. The paper discusses several limitations of the current work such as potential information leakage and domain generalization challenges. Elaborate on these limitations and discuss how they may be addressed in future work.
