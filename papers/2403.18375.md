# [Stragglers-Aware Low-Latency Synchronous Federated Learning via   Layer-Wise Model Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18375)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) trains machine learning models over distributed edge devices without sharing their local data. A key challenge is system heterogeneity - differences in devices' compute capabilities.
- This causes stragglers - slower devices that delay synchronous rounds of FL when servers wait for their updates before aggregation. Stragglers limit FL's ability to operate under tight latency constraints.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Straggler-Aware Layer-Wise Federated Learning (SALF), a novel aggregation method in synchronous FL. 
- SALF exploits the layer-wise backpropagation procedure of training neural networks. When the latency deadline expires, stragglers convey their partially computed gradients from later layers.
- The global model is then updated in a layer-wise fashion - each layer aggregated from the set of users who computed gradients for that layer, with different user sets per layer.

Main Contributions:
- Derivation and analysis of the SALF algorithm. Rigorously proves asymptotic convergence rate matches vanilla FL without stragglers, while bounding gap to optimal model.
- Key insight is to model stochastic nature of stragglers, allowing partial gradients from different random user sets per layer without bias.
- Extensive experiments on image datasets with varying neural network architectures demonstrate SALF reliably trains models under tight latency constraints. Outperforms baselines discarding or altering updates from stragglers.

In summary, the paper proposes SALF as an elegant way to enable low-latency synchronous FL without sacrificing model accuracy by exploiting layer-wise computations. Convergence guarantees and strong empirical results highlight SALF mitigates effects of system heterogeneity in emerging FL applications.
