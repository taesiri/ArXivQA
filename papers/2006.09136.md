# [When Does Self-Supervision Help Graph Convolutional Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09136)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions seem to be:

1. Can self-supervised learning improve the performance of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) on node classification and other downstream tasks? 

2. What are effective mechanisms to incorporate self-supervision into GCN training? The paper compares pretraining+finetuning, self-training, and multi-task learning.

3. What are good self-supervised pretext tasks that provide useful inductive biases and regularization for GCNs? The paper proposes and evaluates node clustering, graph partitioning, and graph completion tasks. 

4. Can self-supervision improve the robustness and uncertainty estimation of GCNs? The paper examines using self-supervision in adversarial training for GCNs.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that properly designed self-supervised tasks and training mechanisms can enhance the generalizability, robustness, and uncertainty estimation of GCNs for node classification and other graph-based tasks. The paper aims to provide a systematic study to validate this hypothesis.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few observations on how this sample ICML paper compares to other research on graph neural networks:

- This paper presents a systematic study of incorporating self-supervised learning into graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Self-supervision for GCNs is still an underexplored area compared to self-supervision for CNNs on image data. The recent work on M3S (Sun et al. 2019) is one of the first attempts at using self-supervision to improve GCN performance. This paper goes much more in-depth by studying different mechanisms to incorporate self-supervision and proposing new self-supervised tasks tailored for graphs.

- The analysis of different schemes to combine self-supervision and GCNs (pretraining+finetuning, self-training, multi-task learning) provides useful insights. Showing that multi-task learning works best highlights the importance of jointly optimizing the main and auxiliary tasks. This is consistent with findings in the CNN literature.

- The novel self-supervised tasks of graph partitioning and graph completion are creative ways to leverage graph structure and properties for representation learning. The theoretical analysis relating tasks to different priors/assumptions is insightful.

- Demonstrating improved adversarial robustness with self-supervision is an important contribution. The analysis of which tasks help against which attack types reveals the connection between priors induced by self-supervision and robustness. This direction of improving model robustness is still relatively less explored for GCNs.

- The extensive experiments on multiple datasets, GCN variants, and analysis from different perspectives (optimization, regularization, robustness) make this a thorough empirical study. The conclusions are supported by rationales from both theory and experiments.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in self-supervision for GCNs through new tasks, extensive experiments, and illuminating analysis. The directions opened up could inspire more research into self-supervised representation learning tailored for graphs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more novel and effective self-supervised learning tasks for GCNs, beyond the three proposed in this work (node clustering, graph partitioning, graph completion). The authors suggest exploring other ways to utilize the components of graph data like nodes, edges, features, etc. 

- Adapting the self-supervised learning approaches to inductive settings, where the test nodes are unseen during training. The current work focuses on transductive semi-supervised learning.

- Enabling transfer learning with self-supervision on graphs, where the self-supervision goes beyond just the given graph to external data sources. 

- Establishing more rigorous principles and theoretical understanding on how to design optimal self-supervised tasks based on the target task, dataset characteristics, and network architecture. The current work provides some empirical analysis but more systematic study is needed.

- Exploring ensemble of diverse self-supervision tasks instead of relying on a single task. Diversity and ensembles are known to often improve performance in machine learning.

- Studying the effects of self-supervision for other graph-based applications beyond semi-supervised node classification, like link prediction, graph classification, etc.

- Investigating if self-supervision can improve model uncertainty and out-of-distribution detection abilities for GCNs, as it does for CNNs.

- Combining self-supervision with other advanced techniques like graph neural architecture search to find optimal GCN architectures.

In summary, the authors suggest further exploration of new self-supervised tasks, adaptation to inductive and transfer settings, more theoretical understanding, task ensembles, applications beyond classification, and integration with other advanced techniques as promising future work.
