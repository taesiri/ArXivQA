# [Plan4MC: Skill Reinforcement Learning and Planning for Open-World   Minecraft Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16563)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we efficiently solve diverse and long-horizon tasks in complex open-ended environments like Minecraft using reinforcement learning?The key points are:- Minecraft presents challenges for RL like large state/action spaces, partial observability, long task horizons. Directly applying RL to solve tasks is highly sample inefficient.- The paper proposes to decompose tasks into sequences of basic skills that are easier to learn. It defines 3 types of fine-grained skills: Finding, Manipulation, Crafting.- It trains goal-directed policies to acquire the basic skills using intrinsic rewards like CLIP similarity and navigation rewards.- For high-level planning, it builds a skill graph using an LLM and proposes a skill search algorithm to plan skill sequences. - Experiments on 24 diverse Minecraft tasks requiring long sequential skill execution show their hierarchical approach significantly outperforms baselines.In summary, the core hypothesis is decomposing tasks into basic reusable skills and hierarchical planning can enable RL to efficiently solve diverse, long-horizon tasks in complex environments like Minecraft. The results seem to validate this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a method called Plan4MC for solving diverse tasks in the open-world game Minecraft. The main contribution is using a hierarchical framework that decomposes solving complex Minecraft tasks into:1) Learning basic skills with reinforcement learning. The paper proposes 3 types of fine-grained basic skills: Finding-skills, Manipulation-skills, and Crafting-skills. Policies are trained with RL and intrinsic rewards to acquire these skills.2) Planning over skills to solve tasks. A skill graph is constructed in advance using a large language model, showing relationships between skills. At test time, a skill search algorithm plans skill sequences by walking on this graph.By learning reusable basic skills and planning compositions of them, the proposed Plan4MC framework can efficiently solve long-horizon and diverse tasks in Minecraft. Experiments show it accomplishes 24 difficult tasks and outperforms baselines by a large margin.In summary, the key contribution is using hierarchical reinforcement learning and planning with basic skills to enable RL agents to solve complex tasks efficiently in the open-ended Minecraft environment. The method is evaluated on a diverse task suite and shows promising performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of solving tasks in Minecraft via reinforcement learning and planning:- This paper takes a hierarchical approach of learning basic skills first, then planning and executing those skills to accomplish more complex tasks. This is different from some prior work like MineRL that focused on end-to-end reinforcement learning for complex tasks. The hierarchical approach allows the agent to learn reusable skills.- The three types of basic skills defined (finding, manipulation, crafting) seem more fine-grained than skills defined in some prior works. By making the skills more atomic and short-horizon, it makes them easier to learn with RL.- For skill planning, this paper uses a complementary approach of leveraging a large language model to build a skill graph, then doing search on the graph. This is different from just using the language model alone for planning, and allows correcting errors in the graph.- The skill planning approach here allows interactive planning when skills fail, making the agent more robust than just doing one-shot planning. This idea of alternating planning and execution is similar to some prior hierarchical RL works.- The evaluation on a large set of diverse, long-horizon Minecraft tasks shows the capability of the approach for multi-task open-world problems. Many of the complex crafting tasks have not been benchmarked before.In summary, the key novelties seem to be in the skill decomposition, use of intrinsic rewards for efficient RL skill learning, combination of LLM and search for planning, and demonstration of the approach on a wide set of challenging tasks. The hierarchical approach and interactive execution are adapted from prior works. Overall it provides an effective approach for learning reusable skills and composing them for complex tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more sophisticated exploration strategies for learning basic skills with RL in Minecraft. The current approach of using a hierarchical policy for finding skills is limited in that it can only explore the surface world. Methods that can also explore underground efficiently need to be developed.- Extending the method to solve more diverse and complex tasks in Minecraft. The current 24 tasks mainly focus on crafting items and interacting with passive mobs. More challenging tasks like navigating, building structures, and fighting hostile mobs could be investigated.- Improving the reliability and adaptability of learned skills. The success rates of some manipulation skills drop significantly from training to test environments. Developing methods that can acquire skills that reliably transfer to new situations would be useful.- Studying how to automate or simplify the skill relationship graph construction process. Currently, the graph relies heavily on manual verification of the LLM's outputs. Exploring ways to reduce human involvement in this pipeline could make the system more scalable.- Investigating fully end-to-end training of the hierarchical agent. Rather than separately pre-training low-level skills, learning the skills and high-level planning jointly in an end-to-end manner could lead to better performance.- Applying similar hierarchical skill learning and planning frameworks to other complex, open-ended environments beyond Minecraft. The general methodology could potentially translate to other domains like robotics.In summary, the key future directions are developing more advanced skill learning methods, expanding the diversity of solved tasks, improving skill reliability and transferability, reducing human involvement, enabling end-to-end training, and applying the approach to new domains.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Plan4MC, a method for solving diverse tasks in the open-world game Minecraft via hierarchical reinforcement learning. It first defines three types of basic skills - Finding skills for exploration, Manipulation skills for interacting with objects, and Crafting skills. Policies for these skills are trained using reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards for improved sample efficiency. For high-level planning, a skill graph is constructed using a large language model to encode relationships between skills. Then during test time, tasks are decomposed into executable skill plans by searching this graph. The method is evaluated on a suite of 24 Minecraft tasks requiring long sequences of skills. It significantly outperforms baselines like a flat reinforcement learning agent and interactive planning with language models. The results demonstrate the promise of hierarchical reinforcement learning for building generalist agents that can accomplish complex goals in open-ended environments. Key components are defining granular skills suited for RL, learning them efficiently, and leveraging learned world knowledge for high-level planning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a method called Plan4MC for solving diverse tasks in the open-world game Minecraft. The key idea is to break down complicated Minecraft tasks into sequences of basic skills that can be learned independently with reinforcement learning. The skills are divided into three types - Finding skills for exploration, Manipulation skills for interacting with objects, and Crafting skills. Policies for these skills are trained with a combination of intrinsic rewards like progress on subgoals. For planning, the relationships between skills are extracted using a large language model to build a skill graph. At test time, a search algorithm traverses this graph to find an executable sequence of skills for a given task. The agent alternates between planning and execution, replanning when skills fail. Experiments on a suite of 24 Minecraft tasks requiring long sequences of 2-30 skills show the proposed method Plan4MC significantly outperforms baselines. The hierarchical approach enables solving more complex tasks compared to learning monolithic policies. The work demonstrates the promise of combining skill learning and planning for multi-task reinforcement learning in large open-ended environments.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning method called Plan4MC to solve diverse tasks in the open-world game Minecraft. The key ideas are:1. Define three types of fine-grained basic skills - Finding skills to explore and find target blocks/entities, Manipulation skills to interact with targets, and Crafting skills to craft items. 2. Learn these basic skills with reinforcement learning and intrinsic rewards for better sample efficiency. The Finding skills use a hierarchical policy for efficient exploration. Manipulation skills use rewards like CLIP similarity, distance to target, and attack rewards.  3. Construct a skill graph using a large language model, where nodes are skills and edges indicate relationships like prerequisite or consumption. This graph is checked manually for mistakes.4. Given a new task, use a search algorithm that walks the skill graph to find an executable skill sequence for the task. Alternate between planning and execution interactively.5. Evaluate on 24 long-horizon Minecraft tasks requiring 2-30 skills. The method outperforms baselines by large margins, showing the promise of hierarchical reinforcement learning for multi-task open-world games.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems this paper is addressing the challenge of solving diverse and long-horizon tasks in the open-ended environment of Minecraft using reinforcement learning. Specifically, it discusses how solving such tasks with RL is extremely sample inefficient due to the large state space, partial observability, and long task horizons. To address this, the paper proposes a hierarchical approach that involves:1) Decomposing tasks into sequences of basic skills that are easier to learn via RL. The skills are classified into finding, manipulation, and crafting skills.2) Using RL with intrinsic rewards to learn policies to accomplish these basic skills. This makes skill learning more feasible.3) Constructing a skill graph using a large language model that captures relationships between skills. 4) An interactive skill search algorithm that uses the graph to plan skill sequences for complex tasks.5) Evaluating the approach on 24 diverse Minecraft tasks involving multiple skills.In summary, the key ideas are decomposing tasks hierarchically, learning basic skills with RL, planning sequences using a learned skill graph, and interactive planning to accomplish long-horizon open-world Minecraft tasks more efficiently.
