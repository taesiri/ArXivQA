# [Learning Novel View Synthesis from Heterogeneous Low-light Captures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13337)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods assume input images are captured under sufficient lighting with the same brightness level. However, real-world captures often violate these assumptions, having low-light conditions with heterogeneous brightness and significant noise. This causes issues for novel view synthesis using NeRF. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an unsupervised learning approach to decompose low-light multi-view images into reflectance, illumination and noise components based on the Retinex theory. This allows handling images with varying brightness and noise levels. The key ideas include:

1) Learn shared density and multi-view invariant reflectance from spatial locations. Reflectance uses sigmoid activation to constrain values between 0-1.

2) Learn an illumination embedding to encode heterogeneous brightness in views. It estimates high dynamic range (HDR) illumination, with a tone mapping network to convert it to low dynamic range.

3) Optimize a noise map for each view to account for different noise levels. Noise uses tanh activation to constrain magnitudes. 

4) Design an illumination adjustment module that takes decomposed illumination and ratio as input to enhance or darken illumination when synthesizing novel views.

5) Use several losses to enable plausible decomposition - reconstruction, reflectance, illumination, noise regularization losses.

The two-stage framework first performs decomposition on training views. The second stage is supervised with views of higher/lower brightness to learn illumination adjustment.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes unsupervised intrinsic decomposition of real-world low-light images into reflectance, illumination and noise
- Learns illumination embedding and noise maps to account for heterogeneous brightness and noise levels
- Designs illumination adjustment module for intuitive editing of brightness in novel views
- Enables high-quality novel view synthesis from challenging real low-light captures 

The method is evaluated on real-world indoor/outdoor scenes captured with varying low-light conditions. Comparisons show it achieves superior view synthesis and enhancement over state-of-the-art NeRF methods.
