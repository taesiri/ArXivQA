# [SimAC: A Simple Anti-Customization Method against Text-to-Image   Synthesis of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07865)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes enhancements to existing anti-customization methods for diffusion models to better protect user privacy. It examines two inherent properties of diffusion models to guide improvements: (1) the relationship between timestep selection and model perception in the frequency domain, and (2) the roles of features from different layers during denoising. Based on analysis of these properties, the paper presents two main contributions - an adaptive greedy algorithm for optimal timestep selection that integrates with iterative attack methods, and a feature interference loss targeting high-frequency information. Experiments demonstrate that combining these techniques with existing anti-customization approaches, such as Anti-DreamBooth, significantly increases identity disruption in generated images. This boosted performance helps safeguard user privacy by making it more difficult for diffusion models to capture details from private user photos during malicious customization attempts. The improvements are generalizable and effective across datasets, noise budgets, model versions, customization methods, and evaluation metrics. In summary, by deeply analyzing and aligning adversarial attacks with intrinsic diffusion model properties, this paper meaningfully pushes forward the state-of-the-art in anti-customization.
