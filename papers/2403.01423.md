# [Collective Certified Robustness against Graph Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to graph injection attacks (GIAs) where adversaries inject carefully crafted malicious nodes into the graph to disrupt node classifications. 
- Existing defense methods like adversarial training or GNN architecture modifications may fail against adaptive attacks. Provable defenses offer robustness certificates but prior works only provide sample-wise certificates by verifying nodes independently. This leads to limited defense performance.
- No existing method provides collective certificates against GIAs which certify a set of nodes simultaneously against a realistically constrained attack targeting multiple nodes.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the first collective robustness certificate against GIAs to significantly improve certification performance. 
- It assumes the attacker aims to modify predictions of as many target nodes as possible under constraints like limited injected nodes and edges per node.
- By modeling the worst-case attack, remaining nodes can be certified robust. But the formulation is an intractable binary quadratic constrained program.
- A customized linear relaxation technique is introduced to transform it into an efficiently solvable Linear Program while ensuring soundness.

Main Contributions:
- First collective certificate for certifiable robustness against GIAs that verifies multiple target nodes simultaneously.
- Significantly increases certified ratio from 0% to over 80% on datasets like Cora and Citeseer against GIAs. 
- Computationally efficient, solving optimization in about 1 minute even for larger attacks.
- Almost model-agnostic, applicable to common message-passing GNN architectures.
- Marks an important step towards making certified defenses against GIAs practical.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution by proposing the first computationally feasible collective robustness certificate to defend graph neural networks against realistic graph injection attacks targeting multiple nodes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents the first collective robustness certification scheme for graph neural networks against graph injection attacks by formulating the problem as a binary quadratic constrained linear program and then developing a customized linearization technique to relax it to an efficiently solvable linear program.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing the first collective robustness certification scheme for graph neural networks (GNNs) against graph injection attacks (GIAs). Specifically:

- The paper presents the first approach to certify a set of nodes collectively against GIA, instead of verifying each node independently. This allows providing robustness guarantees for more nodes simultaneously.

- To achieve collective certification, the paper formulates the problem as a binary quadratic constrained linear program (BQCLP). However, solving BQCLP is computationally prohibitive. 

- To address this, the paper develops a customized linearization technique to relax the BQCLP into a linear program (LP) that can be efficiently solved at scale.

- Through comprehensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that the proposed collective certification scheme significantly improves the certified robustness of GNNs against GIAs, with minimal additional computation compared to prior art.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient and effective collective certification scheme against GIAs that marks an important step towards making certified defense approaches more practical for real-world graph learning tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes the first collective robustness certificate against graph injection attacks. How is this collective certificate fundamentally different from existing sample-wise certificates? What are the key advantages it offers?

2. The paper formulates the collective certification problem as a binary integer quadratic constrained linear program (BQCLP). Explain the rationale behind this formulation and the significance of modeling it as an optimization problem. 

3. The BQCLP formulation is computationally intractable. The paper proposes two linear programming (LP) relaxations - Collective-LP1 using standard techniques and Collective-LP2 using a customized reformulation. Analyze the differences between these two relaxations and discuss why Collective-LP2 demonstrates better efficiency.

4. The integrity gap introduced due to the LP relaxation results in a drop in certified performance when the attack budget is small. Suggest potential methods to derive tighter relaxations that can minimize this integrity gap. 

5. The paper demonstrates a significant boost in certified ratios from the collective certification approach compared to sample-wise methods. Discuss the reasons why collective certification is fundamentally more effective in improving robustness against graph injection attacks.

6. How does the paper address the expanding receptive field challenge posed by graph injection attacks? Explain how the concept of message interference probability is used to quantify the impact of injected nodes. 

7. The runtime experiments demonstrate that Collective-LP2 scales well even for larger attack budgets. What modifications make Collective-LP2 more efficient compared to Collective-LP1?

8. Discuss the assumptions made by the paper regarding the capabilities of the adversary in defining the threat model. Are these assumptions reasonable? What are some ways the attack model can be extended?

9. The method certifies the predictions of any message-passing GNN model. What modifications would be required to support certification for GNN models based on more complex architectures like graph transformers or MPNNs? 

10. The paper focuses exclusively on graph injection attacks. How can the fundamental approach be adapted to provide collective certificates against other types of graph attacks like topology poisoning or meta attacks?
