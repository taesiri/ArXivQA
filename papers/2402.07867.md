# [PoisonedRAG: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented   Generation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07867)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new attack called PoisonedRAG that targets retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. RAG systems augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database to mitigate limitations of LLMs like lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination behaviors. 

The proposed PoisonedRAG attack allows an attacker to inject a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database such that the LLM in the RAG system generates attacker-chosen target answers for attacker-chosen questions. This could allow attackers to spread disinformation, bias, and harm.

The key challenges in crafting effective poisoned texts stem from directly solving the optimization problem of maximizing the objective that the LLM generates the target answers when using retrieved poisoned texts as context. To address this, the paper introduces two necessary conditions - a retrieval condition and an effectiveness condition that the poisoned texts need to satisfy.

The paper presents both black-box and white-box variants of PoisonedRAG that craft poisoned texts satisfying both conditions by decomposing each poisoned text into two components achieving each condition independently and combining them.

Experiments across 3 datasets, 8 LLMs and comparisons to baselines demonstrate that PoisonedRAG can achieve over 90% attack success rates with a very small poisoning rate of 0.0002-0.00006% per target question. The attacks are also shown to be robust to defenses like paraphrasing, perplexity-based detection and duplicate filtering.

The paper highlights an important vulnerability in RAG systems that needs to be addressed especially given their increasing real-world deployment. Key future work includes developing defenses against such knowledge poisoning attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes PoisonedRAG, a set of knowledge poisoning attacks to retrieval-augmented generation of large language models, where an attacker can inject a few poisoned texts into the knowledge database to manipulate the model's responses to attacker-chosen questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes PoisonedRAG, a set of knowledge poisoning attacks to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it shows an attacker could inject a few poisoned texts into the knowledge database of RAG such that the LLM generates attacker-chosen target answers for attacker-chosen target questions.

2. It formulates knowledge poisoning attacks as an optimization problem and designs two effective solutions (black-box attack and white-box attack) based on the background knowledge of an attacker. 

3. It conducts extensive evaluation of PoisonedRAG on multiple benchmark datasets and LLMs. The results demonstrate PoisonedRAG could achieve high attack success rates with small poisoning rates. Additionally, it compares PoisonedRAG with multiple baselines.

4. It explores several potential defenses against PoisonedRAG, including paraphrasing, perplexity-based detection, duplicate text filtering, and knowledge expansion. The results show these defenses are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing knowledge poisoning attacks to RAG of LLMs, systematically evaluating the attacks, and showing that existing defenses are insufficient. The results highlight the need for developing new defenses.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A technique to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieved from a database to mitigate issues like lack of knowledge or hallucination.

- Knowledge poisoning attack: The paper proposes these attacks where an attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database so that the LLM generates attacker-chosen target answers for attacker-chosen questions.

- Threat model: The attacker goals, capabilities, and background knowledge assumptions characterizing the proposed attacks.

- Attack success rate (ASR): A key metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of the attacks, measuring the fraction of target questions that produce the attacker's desired target answers.

- Black-box vs white-box attack settings: The attacks are designed for scenarios where the attacker has limited or full knowledge of the retriever component.

- Defenses: The paper analyzes defenses like paraphrasing questions, perplexity-based detection, and knowledge expansion to mitigate such attacks.

In summary, the key focus is on knowledge poisoning attacks to retrieval-augmented language models, formally defining the attack model, goals, and metrics, and designing and evaluating attack techniques in different settings. Defenses and limitations are also discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a threat model where the attacker can inject poisoned texts into the knowledge database. What are some realistic attack scenarios where this threat model would apply? For example, editing Wikipedia pages or news articles.

2. The paper decomposes a poisoned text into two components - S and I - to achieve the retrieval and effectiveness conditions. Why is this decomposition important? Does simply concatenating random or unrelated texts also work?

3. The paper claims the attack is very effective even with a small poisoning rate (0.0002%). What factors contribute to the high attack success rate? For instance, the sensitivity of retrievers and LLMs.  

4. How does the attack exploit the nature of semantic similarity calculations used in retrievers? Does using more advanced semantic matching like BERT help mitigate the attack?

5. The attack effectiveness relies on the text generation capabilities of LLMs. How would advancements in controllable text generation impact the attack?

6. The paper evaluates the attack on close-ended questions with specific answers. How can the attack be extended or adapted to open-ended subjective questions? What additional challenges need to be addressed?

7. The defenses explored in the paper are shown to be insufficient. What novel defense strategies can be developed? For example, detecting semantic incongruities between retrieved texts.  

8. How can the attack be enhanced by considering dependencies between multiple target questions when crafting poisoned texts? What algorithmic changes are needed?

9. What assumptions does the attack make about the victim RAG system? How can variations in these configurations impact attack success rates?

10. The attack relies on querying LLMs to generate component I. How can the detection of anomalous LLM usage patterns deter such attacks?
