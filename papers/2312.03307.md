# [Balanced Marginal and Joint Distributional Learning via Mixture   Cramer-Wold Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03307)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel generative modeling approach called Cramer-Wold Distributional AutoEncoder (CWDAE) that balances learning both the marginal and joint distributions of data more effectively. The key innovation is using a mixture Cramer-Wold distance measure for the reconstruction loss that incorporates marginal distribution information along with the joint distribution. This is achieved by combining point masses on standard basis vectors with the normalized Cramer-Wold measure. Experiments on real tabular datasets demonstrate CWDAE's superior performance in capturing statistical similarity from both marginal and joint perspectives compared to prior methods like VAE, GANs and models using just the Cramer-Wold distance. The mixture measure provides flexibility to adjust the focus on marginal versus joint distribution learning. CWDAE also allows controlling the level of data privacy. The compact formulation maintains a closed-form solution for practical implementation. In summary, CWDAE introduces an advanced reconstruction loss using a mixture distance measure that strikes an improved balance between critical distribution learning aspects.
