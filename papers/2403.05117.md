# [Arbitrary-Scale Point Cloud Upsampling by Voxel-Based Network with   Latent Geometric-Consistent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05117)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing point cloud upsampling methods only support fixed upsampling rates. They require building and training multiple networks for different rates, which is inefficient. Recently, arbitrary-scale upsampling methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, existing arbitrary-scale methods typically formulate upsampling as a surface approximation problem using point-based networks. Learning accurate surfaces from sparse inputs with such methods remains challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes PU-VoxelNet, a novel arbitrary-scale point cloud upsampling framework using a voxel-based network. Voxel grids provide a regular and complete structure to represent shapes. The core idea is to approximate a surface patch within each voxel grid cell as a density distribution of points. After predicting the density distributions, an arbitrary number of points can be sampled to reconstruct the surface.  

To address the inaccurate sampling issue of existing grid sampling schemes, a density-guided grid resampling method is proposed. It collects more candidate voxels than needed, then prunes outliers using both density predictions and geometry cues to obtain a clean set of voxels representing the surface.  

Furthermore, a latent geometric consistency loss is designed to improve fine-grained details. It captures feature differences between local surface patches in the latent space to implicitly constrain points to lie on the target surface.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes PU-VoxelNet, a voxel-based network for arbitrary-scale point cloud upsampling 
- Develops a density-guided grid resampling method to generate high-fidelity points while avoiding sampling outliers
- Presents a latent geometric-consistent loss to improve local surface approximation
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real scanned datasets for various upsampling settings
