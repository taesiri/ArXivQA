# [An Overview of MLCommons Cloud Mask Benchmark: Related Research and Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04799)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper provides an overview of the MLCommons Cloud Mask Benchmark activity being conducted by the MLCommons Science Working Group. The goal of cloud masking is to accurately label each pixel in satellite images as either cloud or clear sky. The benchmark uses Sentinel-3 satellite images with Bayesian cloud masks as ground truth data. The paper summarizes related research in cloud masking, ranging from traditional rule-based methods to more recent deep learning approaches. It also describes the Sentinel-3 dataset and preprocessing in detail, including how the images are split into patches for training versus testing. Ongoing benchmark efforts are outlined, including the original implementation from Rutherford Labs based on U-Net, as well as additional work by researchers at the University of Virginia and New York University to enhance the benchmark codebase. Overall, the paper serves as an introduction to those looking to get started with or collaborate on the MLCommons Cloud Mask Benchmark.
