# [Model Tailor: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Multi-modal Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12048)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Model Tailor: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Multi-modal Large Language Models":

Problem:
- Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) such as InstructBLIP and LLaVA demonstrate catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on new downstream tasks. Specifically, improving performance on unseen tasks leads to a significant drop in performance on original tasks.
- Existing methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting are designed for smaller models and rely on full-model fine-tuning, which is computationally impractical for large MLLMs. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a parameter-efficient post-training adjustment method called "Model Tailor" to address catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs.
- It works in two main steps:
   1. Identify a sparse "model patch" consisting of a small subset (≤10%) of fine-tuned parameters that are most important for the target task. This is done via a fusion strategy integrating salience and sensitivity analysis.
   2. Apply compensation to the model patch called "patch decoration" to enhance performance on the target task while preserving performance on original tasks. The compensation values are computed based on the inverse Hessian matrix.

- Model Tailor preserves ≥99% of performance on original tasks compared to pre-training, while achieving ≥97% of fully fine-tuned performance on target tasks.
- It can also be extended to multi-task scenarios by stitching together model patches from different tasks.

Main Contributions:
- First analysis of catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs for multimodal generation and comprehension tasks.
- Pioneering parameter-efficient solution tailored to characteristics of large MLLMs that relies on model patch identification and decoration.
- Demonstrated effectiveness in preserving performance on original tasks while efficiently adapting MLLMs to new tasks. 
- Showed flexibility of approach by extending it to multi-task learning scenarios.

The paper validates Model Tailor extensively on InstructBLIP and LLaVA models, using datasets spanning image captioning and visual question answering. The method mitigates catastrophic forgetting much more effectively than baseline approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning multi-modal large language models on new tasks, the proposed Model Tailor method identifies a small subset of critical fine-tuned parameters (the "model patch") and makes compensatory adjustments to preserve performance on original tasks while retaining effectiveness on target tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a parameter-efficient post-training method called Model Tailor to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically:

1) Model Tailor identifies a small subset of fine-tuned parameters deemed most crucial for enhancing performance on new tasks. This is called the "model patch".

2) It then applies targeted compensation, referred to as "patch decoration", to the selected parameters in order to alleviate performance drops on both original and new tasks resulting from excluding other fine-tuned parameters. 

3) Through an integrated strategy based on principles from the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis and Optimal Brain Surgeon theory, Model Tailor preserves ~99% of performance on original tasks while achieving ~97% on new tasks compared to standard fine-tuning.

4) The method demonstrates adaptability to multi-task scenarios by stitching together parameters from different tasks. 

In summary, Model Tailor introduces an efficient way to fine-tune MLLMs on new tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of knowledge from pre-training and original tasks. This is the main contribution put forth in the paper.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel metric called the H-score to provide a balanced evaluation between original and target tasks. Can you explain the rationale and formulation behind this new metric? How does it improve upon existing evaluation approaches?

2. The paper proposes a two-step approach consisting of identifying the "model patch" and then "decorating the patch". Can you walk through these two key steps in greater detail and clarify how they draw inspiration from techniques like the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis and Optimal Brain Surgeon? 

3. When identifying the "model patch", the method employs a score fusion strategy integrating both salience-based and sensitivity-based metrics. What is the intuition behind using these two perspectives and how do they complement each other?

4. Theorem 1 provides an analytical basis for determining the sensitivity score. Can you explain the significance of using the Hessian matrix in this context and how it captures the geometry of the loss landscape? 

5. Theorem 2 offers a technique to compensate for the exclusion of certain parameters when identifying the "model patch". Walk through the key derivations in the proof of this theorem.

6. The method has been evaluated on two prominent MLLMs - InstructBLIP and LLaVA-1.5. Can you highlight the key architectural differences between these models and discuss how the method caters to both frameworks?

7. How does Model Tailor extend its applicability to multi-task learning scenarios? Explain the mask aggregation strategy used and its benefits.

8. The paper shows how Model Tailor can synergize with other techniques like LoRA. What complementary benefits do the two approaches offer?

9. What techniques were employed to ensure the practical feasibility of computing the Hessian matrix inverse for large models? Discuss the time complexity.

10. The decorator visualization offers useful insights into the method's workings. Analyze the key observations from this visualization and link it back to the goals of the compensation strategy.
