# [Shaping Up SHAP: Enhancing Stability through Layer-Wise Neighbor   Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Shaping Up SHAP: Enhancing Stability through Layer-Wise Neighbor Selection":

Problem:
Kernel SHAP is a popular model-agnostic method for explaining black-box machine learning models by attributing an importance score to each input feature. However, it suffers from instability issues - running Kernel SHAP multiple times on the same input can produce significantly different explanations. This stems from the stochastic neighbor selection procedure in Kernel SHAP. The paper shows empirically that Kernel SHAP's explanations can vary across runs, diminishing its utility.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents two main contributions:

1. It proposes a novel neighbor selection strategy called ST-SHAP that generates neighbors layer-by-layer, completely filling each layer before moving to the next. This reduces randomness compared to Kernel SHAP's sampling which jumps across layers randomly based on weights. Experiments show ST-SHAP improves stability without hurting explanation fidelity.

2. It studies the attribution scores obtained by only using the coalitions from Layer 1, consisting of input perturbations of size 1. This is shown to be an attribution method itself that is very fast, completely stable, and aligns well with exact SHAP values theoretically and empirically. 

Main Contributions:
- Identifies instability in Kernel SHAP explanations arising from stochastic neighbor selection
- Proposes ST-SHAP to enhance stability by controlled layer-wise neighbor generation 
- Empirically demonstrates improved stability of ST-SHAP without loss in fidelity
- Theoretically analyzes and empirically evaluates Layer 1 attributions as a novel, fast, and meaningful attribution method

In summary, the paper offers useful insights into instability of Kernel SHAP and provides two ways to enhance stability - through a better neighbor selection strategy, and by using attributions from Layer 1 coalitions. The proposals are supported by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an enhanced version of Kernel SHAP, called ST-SHAP, which achieves full stability in explanations by systematically filling coalition layers, as well as a novel attribution method based only on the first layer coalitions that is fast, stable, and retains the desirable theoretical properties of SHAP values.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. An alternative procedure for choosing the neighbors (coalitions) of a target instance in Kernel SHAP in order to improve stability of the explanations without compromising fidelity. This is called ST-SHAP.

2. A thorough experimental study evaluating the stability and fidelity of Kernel SHAP using different neighbor selection strategies, including the proposed ST-SHAP. The experiments show that ST-SHAP achieves stability without hurting explanation fidelity. 

3. A theoretical analysis of using only the Layer 1 neighbors to compute attribution scores. This method, called Layer 1 attribution, is shown to have good theoretical properties, align well with exact SHAP values experimentally, and be much faster to compute.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) a more stable version of Kernel SHAP called ST-SHAP, (2) an experimental analysis demonstrating its improved stability without loss of fidelity, and (3) a novel and efficient attribution method based only on Layer 1 neighbors.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Kernel SHAP - A model-agnostic method to approximate SHAP values that estimates attribution scores by solving a weighted linear regression on a random sample of neighbor instances.

- SHAP values - Feature attribution scores based on Shapley values from game theory that explain model predictions by assigning contribution values to input features. 

- Stability - The ability of an explanation method like Kernel SHAP to deliver consistent results across multiple executions on the same input. 

- Fidelity - How well the approximate SHAP values from Kernel SHAP adhere to the predictions of the original black-box model being explained.

- Layer 1 neighbors - Simple feature perturbations where only one feature is present or absent. Using only Layer 1 neighbors to train the Kernel SHAP explainer is shown to improve stability.

- Coalitions - Subsets of input features, referring to the same concept as neighbor instances.

- Local post-hoc explainability - Providing explanations for individual predictions made by black-box models, as opposed to global interpretability.

- Linear regression - Kernel SHAP trains a linear regression model on the sampled neighbor coalitions to estimate SHAP values.

- Weighted linear regression - Kernel SHAP solves a weighted least squares problem to fit the linear regression, using a weighting kernel called the Shapley kernel.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel neighbor selection approach called ST-SHAP to improve the stability of Kernel SHAP explanations. Can you explain in detail how the neighbor selection works in ST-SHAP and how it differs from the original Kernel SHAP?

2. The paper shows theoretically that the attribution values obtained from only the Layer 1 neighbors satisfy key properties like linearity, efficiency and symmetry. Can you explain why satisfying these properties is important for an attribution method?

3. Kernel SHAP explanations can become unstable due to the stochastic nature of the neighbor sampling, especially when sampling from the higher layers with more diverse coalitions. Can you elaborate on the strategies used in ST-SHAP to restrict this randomness and improve stability?

4. The paper evaluates stability using the Jaccard index between feature sets of multiple SHAP explanations on the same instance. Can you think of any other appropriate metrics that could be used to quantify stability? What are some pros and cons of the Jaccard index?

5. Explanation fidelity is evaluated in the paper by comparing the prediction of the SHAP linear model to that of the original blackbox model. Do you think this is an appropriate measure of fidelity? What other fidelity metrics could be relevant in this context?

6. The Layer 1 attribution method relies only on the simplest feature coalitions with 1 feature present or absent. Intuitively, do you think this could limit the faithfulness of the explanations? What experiments were done to verify that the Layer 1 attributions remain faithful?

7. Computing SHAP values by materializing all possible coalitions is intractable for any real-world dataset. What is the time complexity of the Layer 1 attribution method proposed in the paper? How does it compare with computing exact SHAP values?

8. The paper shows experimentally that the Layer 1 attribution aligns well with exact SHAP values, but do you think it could fail to detect interaction effects between features? What experiments could be done to analyze the limitations of the Layer 1 approximations?

9. The stability properties hold true when sampling neighborhoods layer-wise. Do you think any issues could arise if we use a mixed strategy sampling some coalitions from Layer 1 and some from higher layers?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on tabular data. Do you think the layer-wise neighbor selection idea could be extended to other data types where SHAP is used, like images or text? What challenges do you foresee?
