# [3QFP: Efficient neural implicit surface reconstruction using   Tri-Quadtrees and Fourier feature Positional encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07164)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Explicit representations (point clouds, meshes, etc.) for mapping require lots of memory and struggle with sparse inputs, resulting in holes and non-smooth surfaces. 
- Recent neural implicit mapping techniques enable compact storage but still have high memory requirements that limit scalability.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel sparse feature structure called "tri-quadtrees" that stores learnable features in 3 planar quadtree projections rather than dense 3D grids. Uses ~10-50x less memory than baselines.
- Also propose combining the tri-quadtree learnable features with Fourier feature positional encodings to enable smoother hole-filling when inputs are sparse.  

- Features from tri-quadtrees and positional encodings are fed into a small MLP that predicts signed distance values for implicit surface representation.

- Features and MLP weights optimized end-to-end from range scan supervision. Surface extracted via Marching Cubes.


Main Contributions:

1) Tri-quadtrees spatial feature structure for highly efficient memory usage compared to voxel grids or octrees

2) Hybrid feature representation combining tri-quadtree features and Fourier positional encoding that enables smoother hole-filling with sparse inputs

3) Demonstrate state-of-the-art memory efficiency - uses only 10-50% memory of baselines with comparable or better map quality and completion ratio. Enables scalability.

In summary, this paper introduces a new spatial feature structure and hybrid feature representation that enables very compact yet high-quality neural implicit mapping from sparse inputs, advancing scalability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a memory-efficient neural implicit mapping method using tri-quadtrees to store compact learned features combined with Fourier feature positional encodings for improved hole-filling and smoothness when given sparse lidar inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel sparse feature representation method called "tri-quadtrees" which combines the sparsity of octrees with the compactness of feature planes. This requires much less memory than previous methods while achieving better completion ratios. 

2. Using Fourier feature positional encoding concatenated with the tri-quadtrees features. This improves the smoothness and hole-filling capabilities when the sensor inputs are sparse.

3. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed approach requires 10-50% less memory than state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive accuracy and better completion ratios. The Fourier encoding also leads to smoother reconstructions.

In summary, the paper proposes a more efficient implicit neural representation for mapping that is memory-efficient, achieves high completion ratios, and handles sparse inputs well. The key ideas are the tri-quadtrees structure and combining it with Fourier feature encoding.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel sparse feature representation structure called tri-quadtrees. How does this structure combine advantages from both octrees and feature planes? What specifically allows it to be more memory efficient?

2. The paper mentions combining learnable features with positional encoding using Fourier features. Why was Fourier feature positional encoding chosen over other alternatives? What benefits does it provide over using the learnable features alone? 

3. When querying a point's SDF value, the paper concatenates the tri-quadtrees feature and Fourier positional encoding into one final feature vector. What is the motivation behind combining these two types of features versus using them separately?

4. The paper argues that storing features in 3D voxel grids leads to excessive memory usage as the environment size increases. How exactly do the proposed tri-quadtrees alleviate this problem? What is the memory complexity comparison?

5. The experiments show that tri-quadtrees requires much less memory than SHINE-Mapping, yet achieves better completion ratios. What specifically about the tri-quadtrees representation enables these improvements in completion while being more memory efficient?  

6. When using positional encoding alone, the paper mentions some artifacts like over-smoothing and stripes. What is causing these artifacts and how does combining positional encoding with learned features help mitigate this?

7. The eventual goal is to combine this mapping approach with tracking for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). What challenges do you anticipate in extending this to a full SLAM system?

8. For large-scale environments, the paper mentions using multiple MLPs based on submaps. How would fusion work across these MLPs? What considerations are needed for consistency?

9. How well would this approach generalize to different environments outside the datasets tested, such as outdoor natural environments? What domains might be more challenging?

10. The mapping is currently supervised by range measurements from lidar scans. Do you think this approach could be extended to use other sensor modalities like vision as well? What changes would need to be made?
