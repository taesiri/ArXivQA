# [Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Interpolants and Föllmer   Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of probabilistic forecasting of dynamical systems, where the goal is to predict the probability distribution of future states of a system given information about its current state. This is important when the dynamics are stochastic, measurements are noisy, or the full state is not observable. The paper argues that probabilistic forecasting is preferred over deterministic forecasting, which can struggle with chaotic dynamics.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using generative modeling based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to sample from the conditional distribution of future states given the current state. Specifically, they leverage the framework of stochastic interpolants to construct an SDE that transports a point mass at the current state to match the target conditional distribution after a fixed time. This SDE uses a learned drift term and additional noise to map deterministically from the current state to a diverse ensemble of probabilistic forecasts.

Key Contributions:

- Design of new generative models for probabilistic forecasting based on SDEs that incorporate stochasticity in a principled way to enable direct initialization at the current state

- Proof that the drift term can be learned via regression on time series data and that the resulting loss has bounded variance

- Demonstration that the noise amplitude can be adjusted after training without re-estimation to minimize the impact of approximation errors, which recovers a Föllmer process

- Validation on several complex high-dimensional forecasting tasks: a simulated jump diffusion process, the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation, and video prediction on KTH and CLEVRER datasets

- Comparisons showing the approach is more effective than conditional normalizing flows and deterministic forecasting baselines

In summary, the key innovation is the design of tailored SDE-based generative models that leverage stochastic interpolants for probabilistic forecasting. Both theory and experiments on challenging problems highlight the usefulness of the framework.
