# [FeaInfNet: Diagnosis in Medical Image with Feature-Driven Inference and   Visual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01871)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FeaInfNet, a novel deep learning model for interpretable medical image diagnosis. FeaInfNet introduces a feature-based reasoning structure to avoid the misleading problem of previous prototype-based models in this domain. Specifically, it compares image patches in local regions to disease and normal prototypes separately, relying only on the most similar sub-region for final classification. This simulates doctor decision processes while preventing normal regions from reducing disease detection accuracy. Additionally, FeaInfNet extracts feature vectors using proposed local feature masks to incorporate both local and global information, enhancing representation power. An adaptive dynamic mask method provides accurate visual explanation of decision-making image regions compared to traditional upsampling. Experiments on five medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and localization ability. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations verify FeaInfNet's capabilities for performant and interpretable medical diagnosis. The model provides a strong basis for trust in deployment of deep learning for critical healthcare applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FeaInfNet, an interpretable neural network for medical image diagnosis that uses a feature-based reasoning structure, local feature masks for feature extraction, and adaptive dynamic masks for visual explanations to achieve high classification accuracy and interpretability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a feature-based reasoning structure that retains the interpretability of the reasoning process while avoiding misunderstandings caused by normal areas in medical images participating in reasoning, thereby improving the accuracy of the network.

2. Proposing local feature masks (LFM) to extract feature vectors, so that the feature vectors retain local information while supplementing global information. This enhances the expressive ability of feature vectors and prototypes, thereby improving the classification accuracy of the network. 

3. Proposing an adaptive weight learning method based on dynamic masks (DM) to form adaptive dynamic masks (Adaptive-DM). This replaces the traditional upsampling similarity activations method to provide more accurate visual explanations for both the proposed FeaInfNet and other prototype-based networks.

In summary, the paper designs an interpretable neural network called FeaInfNet with high classification accuracy and strong interpretability capabilities for medical image diagnosis. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical image datasets compared to previous methods.
