# [FeaInfNet: Diagnosis in Medical Image with Feature-Driven Inference and   Visual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01871)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FeaInfNet, a novel deep learning model for interpretable medical image diagnosis. FeaInfNet introduces a feature-based reasoning structure to avoid the misleading problem of previous prototype-based models in this domain. Specifically, it compares image patches in local regions to disease and normal prototypes separately, relying only on the most similar sub-region for final classification. This simulates doctor decision processes while preventing normal regions from reducing disease detection accuracy. Additionally, FeaInfNet extracts feature vectors using proposed local feature masks to incorporate both local and global information, enhancing representation power. An adaptive dynamic mask method provides accurate visual explanation of decision-making image regions compared to traditional upsampling. Experiments on five medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and localization ability. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations verify FeaInfNet's capabilities for performant and interpretable medical diagnosis. The model provides a strong basis for trust in deployment of deep learning for critical healthcare applications.
