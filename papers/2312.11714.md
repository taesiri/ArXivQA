# [Time-Transformer: Integrating Local and Global Features for Better Time   Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11714)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating realistic time series data is challenging due to the complex temporal properties, including both local correlations and global dependencies. Existing generative models have failed to effectively learn both types of features simultaneously. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel time series generative model called "Time-Transformer AAE". It uses an Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) framework with a new module called "Time-Transformer" inserted in the decoder. 

The Time-Transformer module has two key components:
1) A layer-wise parallel design that combines a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and a Transformer block to simultaneously learn local features and global dependencies. 
2) A bidirectional cross attention mechanism that fuses the TCN and Transformer features bidirectionally to enable interaction between local and global features.

By extracting and fusing both types of features properly, the model can generate high quality synthetic time series containing both local patterns and global trends.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a Time-Transformer module to simultaneously learn local and global time series features in a layer-wise parallel manner, and enable interaction between them via bidirectional cross attention.

- Present a novel time series generative model, Time-Transformer AAE, by integrating the proposed Time-Transformer into the decoder of an adversarial autoencoder.

- Demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in generating time series containing both local and global features. 

- Show model's ability to address real-world problems like data augmentation for small/imbalanced datasets and improving classification performance.

In summary, the key innovation is in designing a specialized Time-Transformer to properly extract and fuse both local and global time series features, to generate high quality synthetic data.
