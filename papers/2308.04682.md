# [Score Priors Guided Deep Variational Inference for Unsupervised   Real-World Single Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04682)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective and practical method for unsupervised real-world single image denoising that can handle structured noise using score priors?The key points are:- The paper proposes an unsupervised deep variational inference method called ScoreDVI that uses score priors for real-world single image denoising. - Existing score-based methods can handle AWGN but not real-world structured noise. Applying them for real-world denoising is complicated as it requires explicitly training score priors on the target domain and careful design of sampling procedures. - The proposed ScoreDVI avoids explicit score training. It extracts score priors using blind MMSE Non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers and uses them to facilitate optimizing the variational image posterior distribution.- ScoreDVI models the real-world noise using a Non-i.i.d Gaussian mixture and infers it via a variational noise posterior. This also enables pixel-wise fusion of multiple image priors and variational posteriors.- A noise-aware prior assignment strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust the weighting of image priors during optimization based on input noise levels.- Experiments show ScoreDVI outperforms other single image methods and achieves competitive results to dataset-based unsupervised methods on benchmark datasets.In summary, the main research question is how to develop an effective and practical unsupervised single image denoising method that can handle real-world structured noise using score priors. The proposed ScoreDVI provides a solution to this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a score priors guided deep variational inference method for unsupervised real-world single image denoising. The main contributions are:1. It proposes an adaptive extraction and utilization of score priors based on MMSE Non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers and deep variational inference. This avoids explicitly training score priors on the target domain and complicated posterior sampling procedures.2. It incorporates a Non-i.i.d Gaussian mixture model and variational noise posterior to model real-world noise. This also enables pixel-wise fusion of multiple image priors and variational image posteriors.3. It develops a noise-aware prior assignment strategy that dynamically adjusts the degree of image priors in the optimization objective based on estimated noise levels. 4. It achieves superior performance compared to other single image-based real-world denoising methods on benchmark datasets and is competitive against dataset-based unsupervised methods while requiring only one noisy image.In summary, it proposes an effective and practical unsupervised deep variational inference framework that exploits score priors for real-world single image denoising. The adaptive extraction and application of score priors, noise modeling strategy, and noise-aware optimization make the proposed method perform well in practice.
