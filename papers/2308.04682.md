# [Score Priors Guided Deep Variational Inference for Unsupervised   Real-World Single Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04682)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop an effective and practical method for unsupervised real-world single image denoising that can handle structured noise using score priors?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes an unsupervised deep variational inference method called ScoreDVI that uses score priors for real-world single image denoising. 

- Existing score-based methods can handle AWGN but not real-world structured noise. Applying them for real-world denoising is complicated as it requires explicitly training score priors on the target domain and careful design of sampling procedures. 

- The proposed ScoreDVI avoids explicit score training. It extracts score priors using blind MMSE Non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers and uses them to facilitate optimizing the variational image posterior distribution.

- ScoreDVI models the real-world noise using a Non-i.i.d Gaussian mixture and infers it via a variational noise posterior. This also enables pixel-wise fusion of multiple image priors and variational posteriors.

- A noise-aware prior assignment strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust the weighting of image priors during optimization based on input noise levels.

- Experiments show ScoreDVI outperforms other single image methods and achieves competitive results to dataset-based unsupervised methods on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the main research question is how to develop an effective and practical unsupervised single image denoising method that can handle real-world structured noise using score priors. The proposed ScoreDVI provides a solution to this problem.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper focuses on unsupervised real-world image denoising using a single noisy input image. Many existing methods require supervised training data or multiple noisy images. So this method is more practical in real applications where clean data or multiple noisy versions may not be available.

- The proposed approach combines deep variational inference with score priors extracted from pre-trained denoisers. Using score priors to facilitate variational optimization is novel. Most prior work uses score-based models just for sampling. 

- The method models real-world noise using a non-i.i.d. Gaussian mixture likelihood and infers it via a variational noise posterior. This provides more flexibility than methods that assume a fixed analytical noise model.

- Adding the noise-aware prior weighting scheme helps adapt the optimization to different noise levels in the input image. This is unlike standard VI that weights the prior and likelihood equally.

- Experiments show the method outperforms other single image denoising techniques on benchmark datasets. It also achieves comparable results to recent unsupervised methods while using only one image.

- The idea of extracting score priors from denoisers avoids explicitly training scores on target data. This is more convenient than existing score-based image restoration methods.

Overall, the key novelty is the integration of score priors with deep variational inference in an unsupervised manner for single image real-world denoising. The adaptive extraction and application of score priors differentiates this work from prior score-based approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different network architectures and hyperparameters for modeling the variational posteriors. The authors used simple CNNs like UNet and DnCNN in this work. Investigating more advanced network designs like transformers could further improve performance.

- Applying the proposed method to other image restoration tasks beyond denoising, such as super-resolution, inpainting, etc. The adaptive score prior extraction framework is general and could be useful for different inverse problems.

- Exploring better strategies and schedules for the noise-aware prior assignment. The authors used a simple heuristic based on estimated noise levels. More principled approaches like Bayesian hyperparameter optimization could be investigated. 

- Extending the method to video and 3D data denoising by incorporating spatio-temporal priors. The current method processes individual images. Modeling the correlations across frames and volumes could further improve results.

- Applying the approach to real-world datasets beyond sRGB images and microscopy, such as medical images, HDR photos, astrophotography, etc. Evaluating the generalizability of the method on more diverse noise types would be interesting.

- Combining the extracted score priors with other probabilistic models beyond variational inference, like Markov chain Monte Carlo. This could provide ways to further improve sampling from the posterior.

In summary, the key future directions are centered around improving the deep neural network components, applying the framework to broader tasks and data types, and integrating with other probabilistic methods to further advance unsupervised real-world image denoising.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a score priors guided deep variational inference method called ScoreDVI for unsupervised real-world single image denoising. The key ideas are:

1) It relates general score functions to easily accessible minimum MSE (MMSE) Non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers and extracts score priors by employing well-trained Non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers to denoise samples from the variational image posterior. The extracted scores are then used to facilitate the optimization of the variational objective. This allows adaptive extraction and application of score priors without explicit training.  

2) It models the real-world noise using a Non-i.i.d Gaussian mixture model and infers the parameters via a variational noise posterior. This enables pixel-wise fusion of multiple image priors and variational image posteriors for better denoising.

3) It develops a noise-aware prior assignment strategy to dynamically adjust the weighting of image priors in the optimization objective based on the input noise level. This maximizes performance for individual noisy images.

Experiments show the method outperforms other single image-based real-world denoising methods and achieves comparable results to dataset-based unsupervised methods on benchmark datasets. The adaptive extraction of score priors is key to enabling effective real-world noise removal using score-based generative modeling.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a score priors guided deep variational inference method for unsupervised real-world single image denoising. The method utilizes score priors extracted from minimum MSE Non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers to facilitate the optimization of the variational posterior distribution.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a summary of the main method in one paragraph:

The paper proposes a score priors guided deep variational inference method for unsupervised real-world single image denoising. It models the likelihood as a non-i.i.d Gaussian mixture and introduces variational posteriors parameterized by neural networks. To facilitate optimization of the variational objective, it extracts score priors from minimum MSE non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers and utilizes them to compute the gradients of the KL divergence term involving the image prior. This allows adaptive application of score priors during optimization.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears to be addressing the problem of unsupervised real-world single image denoising. Specifically, it focuses on developing an effective approach to remove real-world structured noise from a single noisy image without relying on paired or unpaired training data. 

The key questions and challenges it aims to tackle include:

- How to effectively model and remove real-world structured noise, which is signal-dependent and spatially correlated, using only a single noisy image? Existing methods like BM3D work well for additive white Gaussian noise but not for real-world noise.

- How to exploit powerful image priors learned by recent deep generative models like score-based models for real-world denoising using just a single image? Current score-based methods require explicit training on the target domain and careful design of sampling procedures, making them impractical.

- How to develop an unsupervised approach that does not rely on paired clean/noisy training data or unpaired separate clean and noisy datasets? This would make the method more practical and generalizable.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a score priors guided deep variational inference framework that can effectively incorporate score priors and perform Bayesian inference for real-world single image denoising in an unsupervised manner.
