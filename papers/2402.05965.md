# [Hybrid Neural Representations for Spherical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05965)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Hybrid Neural Representations for Spherical Data":

Problem:
- Coordinate-based neural representations (CNRs) have been widely used to represent signals by mapping coordinates to signal values. However, CNRs often fail to capture intricate details of highly nonlinear signals. 
- Recent CNR methods for spherical data rely on coordinate-based MLPs using sinusoids, spectral embeddings, or spherical harmonics. But they lack expressive power to approximate complex spherical signals.
- Extending hybrid neural representations (that combine feature grids and MLPs) from Euclidean to spherical domains is non-trivial due to reliance on grid structures and interpolation algorithms specific to Euclidean data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a novel hybrid neural representation for spherical data (HNeR-S) using spherical feature grids combined with an MLP.
- Main idea is to use hierarchical spherical feature grids to generate multi-frequency positional features for an input coordinate.
- Uses equirectangular and HEALPix feature grids tailored for weather/climate data and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data respectively.
- Assigns parameters to grid points and applies spherical interpolation to output positional feature for an input point.
- MLP takes the concatenated positional features from multiple grid levels as input and predicts the target signal value.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes HNeR-S, a novel hybrid neural representation for spherical data using tailored spherical feature grids and interpolation.
- Designs equirectangular and HEALPix feature grids aligned with structure of weather/climate and CMB data respectively.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on tasks like super-resolution, regression, temporal interpolation and compression for both weather/climate and CMB datasets.
- Significantly outperforms previous CNR baselines for spherical data across different tasks and datasets.
- Demonstrates ability to scale to and capture intricate details of high resolution CMB data.

In summary, the paper develops a specialized hybrid neural representation for spherical signals that outperforms prior arts and shows promising results on real-world scientific datasets. The proposed method and analyses open up new possibilities for applying neural representations to spherical data.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel hybrid neural representation for spherical data (HNeR-S), which combines spherical feature-grids with MLPs. Specifically, it uses spherical feature-grids to generate positional features which are then fed into an MLP to predict the target signal. 

2. Designing HNeR-S with two types of spherical feature-grids: (i) an equirectangular grid tailored for weather and climate data, and (ii) a hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization (HEALPix) grid tailored for cosmic microwave background (CMB) data.

3. Conducting extensive experiments on weather/climate data and CMB data for tasks like super-resolution, regression, temporal interpolation, and compression. The results demonstrate the superiority of HNeR-S over several coordinate-based neural representation baselines.
