# [Searching, fast and slow, through product catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Search functionality in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems for Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) is poor, resulting in either no results or too many irrelevant results. This is due to the complex and abbreviated nature of SKU names.  
- Improving search is important to help sales teams quickly and accurately respond to customer queries about product details. 

Proposed Solution:
- A unified SKU search architecture with multiple components:
    - Pattern matcher for part numbers 
    - Dynamic "as-you-type" suggestions using a Trie data structure
    - User-activated search using character-level TF-IDF and language model embeddings for relevance ranking
    - Ensemble re-ranking of results using longest common subsequence
    - SKU description generation using GPT-3.5-Turbo

Key Contributions:
- Show the need for a complex system with both speed and accuracy to balance tradeoffs
- Demonstrate vast improvements over default Dynamics CRM search accuracy and latency
- Present complete system architecture tying together multiple search components 
- Introduce abbreviation expansion and generative text models for enhanced SKU details
- Pending production deployment to improve seller satisfaction and productivity

In summary, the paper proposes a comprehensive search solution for SKUs in CRMs that combines speed, accuracy and enhanced result details to significantly outperform existing systems. A system with multiple components is shown to be necessary to handle the intricate tradeoffs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a unified architecture for product search in customer relationship management systems that provides real-time suggestions using a Trie data structure and lower latency full search using character-level TF-IDF and language model embeddings, outperforming the default search engine on accuracy and speed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is presenting a unified architecture for SKU search that provides both a real-time suggestion system (based on a Trie data structure) and a lower latency search system (using character level TF-IDF and language model embeddings). The paper shows how this multi-component architecture strikes a balance between speed and accuracy to address the tradeoffs in CRM product search.

Some of the key aspects I would highlight as main contributions:

- Proposing a complete search system architecture combining pattern matching, dynamic suggestions, and user-activated search to handle different search scenarios in CRMs

- Using a Trie for fast dynamic suggestions as users type, to provide instant results

- Combining character-level TF-IDF and pre-trained language model embeddings for more accurate but slower user-initiated search

- Conducting ablation studies to analyze the accuracy/latency tradeoffs and justify the need for a multi-component architecture

- Showing significant improvements over the existing search functionality in Dynamics CRM using this approach

- Describing how SKU descriptions can be enhanced using GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate more readable and useful information for sellers

So in summary, the main contribution is the novel search architecture that balances competing needs for speed and accuracy in CRM SKU search.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

String matching, Data structures, Large Language Models, Search Engine Architecture, Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, product search, abbreviation expansion, dynamic search, user-activated search, Trie data structure, Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), character-level representations, Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings, fast and slow trade-off, accuracy vs latency, generative text models, gpt-3.5-turbo

The paper presents a unified architecture for SKU search in CRM systems that provides both real-time suggestion system and lower latency search system. It utilizes techniques like Trie data structure, character-level TF-IDF, LLM embeddings, abbreviation expansion, etc. A key aspect is balancing the trade-off between speed and accuracy. It also shows how SKU descriptions can be enhanced using gpt-3.5-turbo. So these are the key terms and topics associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Trie data structure for dynamic suggestions. What are some limitations of using a Trie in this context and how might the authors address them in future work?

2. The authors use both character-level TF-IDF and LLM embeddings for the user-activated search. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method? Could an ensemble or fusion of both methods lead to further improvements?

3. The paper argues that character-level representations are better suited than word-level for product search queries in CRMs. Elaborate further on this point and discuss if any word-level information could still be useful.  

4. The generative text model using GPT-3.5-Turbo is an interesting addition for enhancing SKU descriptions. How might the authors evaluate the quality and usefulness of the generated descriptions? Are there any risks or limitations associated with generated text that should be considered?

5. The architecture combines several components - pattern matching, dynamic suggestions, user search. Discuss the rationale behind this design and why a single method may not have sufficed. Are there any redundancy concerns with the multiple components?

6. Could semi-supervised or self-supervised methods be useful for better handling abbreviations or learning improved representations, instead of relying solely on labeled data? Elaborate.  

7. The LLM performance lags behind TF-IDF in this work. Speculate on the reasons why and discuss modifications to the LLM usage that could lead to improved performance.  

8. How robust is the overall search system to minor changes or errors in user queries? Would fuzzy matching methods be useful and what challenges might they introduce?

9. The paper focuses on SKU search for a CRM system. How well would the techniques generalize to product search in other domains/applications? What customization may be required?

10. The system has strict latency constraints. How might the authors balance higher accuracy with lower latency if some constraints were relaxed? What tradeoffs might need to be made?
