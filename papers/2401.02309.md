# [TR-DETR: Task-Reciprocal Transformer for Joint Moment Retrieval and   Highlight Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) are two highly related tasks that aim to retrieve relevant moments from videos and assign highlight scores to video clips based on natural language queries. While previous methods have tried to jointly address these tasks using multi-task learning frameworks, they fail to fully utilize the inherent reciprocity between the two tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Task-Reciprocal Transformer based on DETR (TR-DETR) that focuses on exploring the reciprocity between MR and HD tasks. The key ideas are:

1) A local-global multi-modal alignment module that aligns features from videos and queries before interaction to improve joint representations. This helps distinguish between clips that are visually similar but semantically different.

2) A visual feature refinement module that uses aligned query features to filter out irrelevant information from video features before fusion. This avoids irrelevant clips interfering in joint representations.  

3) A task cooperation module consisting of HD2MR and MR2HD components. HD2MR injects predicted highlight scores into moment predictions to eliminate irrelevant clips. MR2HD uses retrieved moments to provide visual support for refining highlight detection.

Main Contributions:

- Highlights and formally defines the inherent reciprocity between the tasks of moment retrieval and highlight detection.

- Proposes a novel TR-DETR network that effectively exploits this reciprocity to optimize both tasks through purpose-designed modules. 

- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets for joint moment retrieval and highlight detection.

- Provides detailed analysis and visualizations that offer insights into the model and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in joint moment retrieval and highlight detection by utilizing the natural reciprocity between tasks that prior arts fail to capitalize on. The proposed TR-DETR effectively exploits this relationship through specialized novelty modules.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a task-reciprocal transformer network called TR-DETR that explores the inherent reciprocity between moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks by aligning multimodal features, refining visual features, and enabling cooperation between the two tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It highlights the reciprocity between moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) tasks, and proposes an innovative TR-DETR network that leverages this reciprocity between tasks to optimize performance. 

2. It introduces local and global alignment regulators to facilitate semantic alignment between video clips and the query, which serves to generate discriminative joint representations.

3. It constructs a task cooperation module that explicitly exploits the complementarity between MR and HD by injecting highlight scores into the moment retrieval pipeline and using the retrieved moments to refine the initial highlight distribution.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework (TR-DETR) that focuses on exploring and exploiting the inherent reciprocity between the moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks to improve performance on both tasks. The local-global alignment module, visual feature refinement, and task cooperation module are designed specifically to achieve this goal.
