# [CARLOS: An Open, Modular, and Scalable Simulation Framework for the   Development and Testing of Software for C-ITS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01836)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Simulations are vital for developing and testing automated driving functions, but current simulation frameworks have limitations in scalability, usability, maintainability, and modularity. 
- There is a need for an open, modular, and scalable simulation architecture that can support key use cases like software prototyping, data-driven development, and automated testing.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel, generic simulation architecture consisting of multiple layers - simulation layer, storage layer, application layer, and orchestration layer. 
- The simulation layer is further divided into sub-layers - simulator, interface, and control layers. This modular design follows microservice principles for flexibility.
- Containerization of components improves maintainability and orchestration tools enable automation and scaling.

Implementation: 
- As a reference implementation called CARLOS, the architecture leverages the CARLA simulator and ROS ecosystems into a flexible framework.
- It provides core building blocks like CARLA server, ROS bridge, scenario runner, and also introduces a data generation pipeline.

Contributions:
- Analysis of key use cases and requirements for automated driving simulations
- Conceptualization of a modular, microservice-based simulation architecture
- Implementation of the open-source framework CARLOS using CARLA and ROS
- Provision of containerized components and examples to showcase different use cases
- Qualitative evaluation of CARLOS against native CARLA on usability, scalability, etc.

The paper aims to provide a foundation for an open, extendable simulation framework to assist development and testing of automated driving software.
