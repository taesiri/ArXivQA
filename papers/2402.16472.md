# [mEdIT: Multilingual Text Editing via Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for text editing tasks like grammatical error correction, paraphrasing, and text simplification. However, most prior work focuses on English or is limited to a single task. 
- There is a lack of high-quality multilingual text editing (MTE) models that can perform well across languages and multiple text editing tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces MeDIT (Multilingual Editing via Instruction Tuning), a unified model for multilingual text editing. 
- MeDIT fine-tunes various multilingual LLMs on a dataset covering 3 text editing tasks (GEC, paraphrasing, simplification) for 7 diverse languages from 6 language families.
- The models are trained via instruction tuning, where natural language instructions specify the desired text edits (e.g. "Simplify this sentence").

Key Contributions:
- First work to explore multitask, multilingual text editing via instruction tuning
- Curates multi-task, multi-lingual datasets from existing resources to train models
- Achieves strong performance on text editing benchmarks across languages, outperforming multilingual baselines
- Shows models can generalize to unseen languages, competitive with language-specific state-of-the-art
- Provides analysis on effects of model architecture, scale, training data on multilingual text editing 
- Publicly releases data, code and models to facilitate research into multilingual writing assistance

In summary, the paper introduces MeDIT, the first unified multitask, multilingual text editing model that pushes the state-of-the-art on multiple editing tasks across diverse languages. The analysis and public release of resources helps advance multilingual intelligent writing assistants.
