# [Learning A Physical-aware Diffusion Model Based on Transformer for   Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01497)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Underwater images suffer from various degradations like diminished contrast and blurriness due to light absorption, refraction and scattering, severely affecting underwater vision tasks. 
- Existing methods either rely on physical models with limited representational power or deep learning models without considering underwater physics.  
- Recently used diffusion models for underwater image enhancement also do not incorporate physical properties and lack awareness of region-specific difficulties.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel physics-aware diffusion model called PA-Diff with two branches:
  - Physics Prior Generation (PPG) branch: Generates transmission map and global background light using a revised physical model as prior physical knowledge
  - Physics-aware Diffusion Transformer (PDT) branch: Restores images using diffusion model with guidance from generated physical priors

- The transmission map indicates region-specific confidences to make PDT branch "underwater-aware".

- Designed novel physics-aware diffusion transformer blocks with two components:
  - Physics-Aware Self-Attention (PA-SA): Models long-range dependencies in features using self-attention along with modulation using physical priors
  - Multi-Scale Dynamic Feed-Forward Network (MS-FFN): Aggregates multi-scale features 

Main Contributions:
- First application of infusion of physical knowledge to guide image restoration process in diffusion models
- A plug-and-play PPG branch to generate physical priors from underwater images
- Physics-aware diffusion transformer blocks to exploit long-range diffusion dependencies
- Significantly outperforms previous methods and ablation studies validate the efficacy of the contributions

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach to make diffusion models "underwater-aware" by guiding them with generated physical priors for superior quality underwater image enhancement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel underwater image enhancement framework called PA-Diff, which consists of a Physics Prior Generation branch to produce transmission map and background light priors and a Physics-aware Diffusion Transformer branch that utilizes those priors to guide the diffusion process for restoring degraded underwater images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) It proposes a novel underwater image enhancement (UIE) framework based on a physics-aware diffusion model called PA-Diff. This is the first diffusion model for image enhancement that utilizes physical information to guide the diffusion process.

2) It designs a physics prior generation (PPG) branch which is a plug-and-play module to produce physics priors like the transmission map and background light. This can be integrated into any deep learning framework.

3) It develops a physics-aware diffusion transformer block which enables the model to have underwater-aware abilities and capture long-range diffusion dependencies. This block contains components like the physics-aware self-attention and multi-scale dynamic feed-forward network.

4) Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance of PA-Diff on UIE tasks compared to previous methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel physics-aware diffusion model for underwater image enhancement, which integrates physical information to guide the diffusion process and achieves superior results. The model design and individual components also contribute to this improved performance.
