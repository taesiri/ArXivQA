# [Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of 3D Reconstruction Using Point and   Line Incidences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13593)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we mathematically analyze and numerically implement the reconstruction of 3D points and lines that satisfy incidence relations from their images in multiple views?

The key hypotheses that are investigated are:

1) The anchored multiview varieties, which encode incidence relations between points and lines, have lower complexity for reconstruction compared to the traditional point and line multiview varieties. This is measured by computing and comparing their Euclidean distance degrees.

2) Algorithmically exploiting the anchored multiview varieties in different ways leads to faster and/or more accurate reconstruction of incident points and lines, compared to not using the incidence relations.

To summarize, the main goal is to gain theoretical and practical understanding of how imposing incidence constraints affects multiview reconstruction, in terms of algebraic complexity and numerical performance. The anchored multiview varieties and associated Euclidean distance degrees provide the mathematical framework, while the numerical experiments test different reconstruction approaches.
