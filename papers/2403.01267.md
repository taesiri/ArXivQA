# [Dissecting Language Models: Machine Unlearning via Selective Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding and controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important as they are rapidly improving and being deployed. However, some abilities of LLMs may be risky or undesired.
- Existing machine unlearning methods to remove capabilities from neural networks are impractical for LLMs as even a forward/backward pass is very costly. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new machine unlearning method called "selective pruning" specifically tailored for LLMs. 
- It removes neurons based on their relative importance for a targeted capability vs overall network performance. This identifies specialized neurons enabling that capability.
- Neurons are scored based on how much their activations deviate from a default value on the forget vs retain datasets. Non-default activations are considered informative.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces selective pruning - a compute and data efficient unlearning method for removing capabilities from LLMs by pruning specialized neurons.
- Demonstrates its effectiveness at selectively removing coding ability from a variety of LLMs while retaining performance on other text.
- Finds feed-forward neurons are more specialized than attention neurons for this task.
- Shows some LLMs are more separable than others in terms of disjoint capabilities.
- Establishes baseline results for comparing future LLM unlearning techniques.
- Provides insights into modularity and specialization within LLMs.

In summary, the paper proposes a neuron pruning approach to selectively remove capabilities from language models. It serves as a low-cost, task-agnostic unlearning technique while also furthering our understanding of how abilities are represented within LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a selective pruning method to remove capabilities from large language models by pruning neurons based on their relative importance to a targeted task compared to overall network performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a machine unlearning method called "selective pruning" for large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- They propose a pruning method to selectively remove capabilities from LLMs by pruning neurons based on their relative importance to two datasets - a "forget" dataset to remove capability on, and a "retain" dataset to maintain performance on.

- This allows selectively forgetting skills like coding while retaining general language modeling capabilities. It is a computation and data efficient method compared to other machine unlearning techniques.

- They show this method is effective at separating capabilities in LLMs - certain neurons are more specialized/crucial for some tasks over others. Removing them impacts "forget" performance more than "retain".  

- They find feed-forward neurons more specialized than attention neurons for forgetting coding while retaining general language modeling. They hypothesize adding dropout to attention could improve modularity.

- The method provides a way to study how capabilities are interconnected in LLMs by seeing how much they can be separated. It also has applications in removing potentially harmful skills from LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and demonstrating an effective pruning-based machine unlearning approach for selectively removing capabilities from LLMs while retaining others.

The paper introduces a selective pruning method to remove capabilities from large language models. It prunes neurons based on their relative importance to a forget dataset versus a retain dataset. The goal is to selectively remove abilities while preserving performance on other tasks. The paper analyzes different model components (feed-forward vs attention) and importance metrics to evaluate this method. Key findings are that certain neurons are specialized for tasks, and pruning feed-forward neurons gave better separability. The concepts of forget dataset, retain dataset, selective/structured pruning, separability, and specialized neurons seem most central to summarizing the key ideas.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the selective pruning method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces selective pruning as a machine unlearning method for large language models (LLMs). How does selective pruning compare to other machine unlearning techniques like influence functions or gradient ascent in terms of computational efficiency for LLMs? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper evaluates selective pruning on removing coding ability from language models. What other potentially harmful or sensitive skills would be good candidates to test this method on, and why? 

3. The paper finds feed-forward neurons are more specialized than attention neurons for the task of removing coding ability. Does this indicate attention mechanisms exhibit more generalization and transfer learning compared to feedforward connections? How might this inform architectures for more modular and separable networks?

4. Could adding dropout or other regularization techniques to attention neurons during pretraining induce more specialization and enable better capability control via selective pruning? What experiments could test this hypothesis?  

5. How does selective pruning compare to other LLM control techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or activation vector steering in terms of fundamentally removing vs just suppressing unwanted capabilities? 

6. The paper uses next token prediction accuracy to measure retained vs forgotten skills. What other metrics like few/zero-shot evaluation, prompt engineering, or skill retrainability could further analyze separation between skills?

7. For real-world use, what strategies could determine optimal prune ratios across model regions to effectively forget certain skills while minimizing impact on others?

8. Could the pruning score threshold itself be adaptive and set based on metrics like maximum allowed retain performance drop or minimum forget performance drop?

9. The paper finds dropout may improve specialization - does this indicate dropout helps prevent overparameterization and entanglement across skills? What further analysis could test this theory?

10. Do the findings reveal underlying inductive biases in LM architectures regarding modularity and separability of linguistic concepts? How can we design networks to explicitly encode and control for such biases?
