# [History Filtering in Imperfect Information Games: Algorithms and   Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14651)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper analyzes the computational complexity of history filtering, which is a key component of depth-limited search algorithms for imperfect information games. The authors define a family of filtering relations that formalize this computation, and show that generating even a single history from a public state is intractable in the worst case. However, efficient enumeration is possible in games with sparse public trees where the number of histories per public state grows polynomially. For trick-taking card games where enumeration is often infeasible, they introduce a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently generate histories represented as states in a Markov chain. This algorithm uses local computations on histories to transition between states, avoiding the need for explicit belief representation. Theoretical results establish correctness, and empirical evaluation on the trick-taking game Oh Hell shows substantially improved scalability over enumerative methods. Overall, these contributions clarify the conditions enabling effective depth-limited search via subgame decomposition in imperfect information games.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the computational complexity of filtering histories for subgame decomposition in imperfect information games, provides conditions for efficient enumeration, and introduces a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for history generation in trick-taking card games.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces and analyzes the computational complexity of different variants of the history filtering problem for subgame decomposition in imperfect information games. In particular, it shows that constructing even a single history consistent with a public state is generally intractable (Theorem 3).

2) It provides a necessary and sufficient condition (public tree sparsity) for the efficient enumeration variant of the history filtering problem (Theorem 4). This helps clarify when depth-limited search via subgame decomposition can be efficiently applied.

3) It introduces a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based algorithm for generating histories in trick-taking card games. This avoids the exponential complexity of explicit enumeration and is shown empirically to scale substantially better. Theoretical results are provided on the correctness and properties of this algorithm.

In summary, the paper advances the theory and methods for applying depth-limited search techniques from perfect information games to imperfect information games. It clarifies the associated computational challenges, identifies when efficient solutions exist, and proposes a new scalable approach for an important class of games.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- History filtering - The process of computing histories from a public state that are consistent with the public observations. This is needed for subgame decomposition.

- Subgame decomposition - Decomposing an imperfect information game tree into public belief states, which are analogous to belief states in POMDPs. This enables depth-limited search algorithms. 

- Enumeration - Explicitly generating all possible histories for a given public state. 

- Generation - Randomly sampling histories from a public state according to a specified distribution.

- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) - Using a Markov chain to randomly generate samples from a target distribution after reaching stationarity.

- Factored Observation Stochastic Games (FOSGs) - A model for sequential decision making in multi-agent settings with both public and private observations. Generalizes POMDPs.

- Trick-taking card games - Domain with large public belief states. Used as an experiment for the TTCG Gibbs sampler algorithm.

- computational complexity - Analyzing the asymptotic time and space complexity of algorithms. Used to characterize the tractability of different variants of history filtering.

The key contributions analyze the complexity of history filtering and provide methods for efficient enumeration and unbiased generation in certain games.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a family of history filtering relations called FILTER. What are the key elements needed to define this relation for a factored observation stochastic game (FOSG)? How does FILTER capture the essence of the history filtering problem?

2. Theorem 1 shows that the construction variant of FILTER is generally intractable. What structure of the 3-FSAT-GAME makes the construction problem FNP-hard? Could a similar result be shown for other variants like generation or counting?

3. The paper identifies a structural property called sparsity that enables efficient enumeration. Explain in detail the necessary and sufficient conditions for sparsity. Why does breadth-first search solve enumeration in sparse public trees? 

4. Explain the construction of the flow network used in Lemma 3 to solve FILTER for trick-taking card games. What insight allowed the reduction of history existence to a maximum flow problem? How are flows mapped to card deals?

5. The TTCG Gibbs sampler transitions between histories using local computations. How does the RingSwap algorithm manipulate the suit length assignment matrix? Walk through the swap sequence needed to correct column sums. 

6. In the proof of Theorem 4, how is it shown that any suit length assignment is reachable from any other assignment? Why does the existence of a path imply irreducibility of the Markov chain?

7. Explain the high-level intuition for why the TTCG Gibbs sampler chain is reversible with respect to the desired distribution $P^\pi$. What is the significance of the acceptance probability $z$ in achieving reversibility?

8. The paper demonstrates scalability improvements from using generation instead of enumeration. What are the limitations of sampling quality depending on the mixing time? Suggest methods for theoretically bounding mixing time.  

9. How suitable would the TTCG Gibbs sampler be for directly generating samples inside a search algorithm? What are factors that would determine appropriate burn-in times?

10. The history generation method is flexible to different policies and ground truth histories. Discuss how it could be integrated into existing search algorithms for imperfect information games. What information needs to be provided?
