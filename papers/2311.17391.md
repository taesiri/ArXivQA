# [Unveiling the Implicit Toxicity in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17391)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper identifies and investigates a concerning new capability of large language models (LLMs) - generating implicit toxic outputs that can evade detection by current toxicity classifiers. Through preliminary experiments, the authors find that simply prompting a model like GPT-3.5-turbo can elicit such tricky implicit toxicity. To further explore and enhance this capability in LLMs, they propose a reinforcement learning method to optimize for preferring implicit over explicit toxicity. Experiments demonstrate their approach can significantly increase attack success rates across classifiers like Perspective API (to 99.55%) and Davinci003 (to 62.85%), suggesting LLMs pose a threat in freely generating undetectable toxicity. Analysis shows LLMs can leverage diverse linguistic devices and knowledge to implicitly express varied toxic types. Finally, the authors demonstrate that fine-tuning classifiers on annotated data from their method can enhance detection of such challenging implicit toxicity from LLMs. Their findings reveal a critical safety loophole that merits further research given the societal risks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method to induce and analyze the ability of large language models to generate implicit toxic language that can evade detection by state-of-the-art toxicity classifiers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It identifies a novel safety risk of large language models (LLMs), namely their ability to generate implicit toxic outputs that are exceptionally difficult to detect using existing toxicity classifiers. 

2. It proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based attacking method to further induce implicit toxicity in LLMs. Specifically, it optimizes the language model with a reward that prefers implicit toxic outputs to explicit toxic and non-toxic ones.

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL attacking method achieves a significantly higher attack success rate compared to previous toxic benchmark datasets and baselines across five widely-adopted toxicity classifiers.

4. Further analysis reveals that LLMs leverage diverse toxic types, linguistic features and extralinguistic knowledge to express implicit toxicity. 

5. It shows that fine-tuning toxicity classifiers on the annotated examples generated by the proposed attacking method can effectively enhance their ability to detect LLM-generated implicit toxic responses.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an RL-based attacking method to induce and analyze the implicit toxicity in LLMs, as well as using the generated toxic data to improve toxicity classifiers.

The paper explores the ability of LLMs to generate implicit toxic outputs that can evade detection by toxicity classifiers. It proposes an RL-based attacking method to induce greater implicit toxicity in LLMs, and shows this increases attack success rates substantially.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based attacking method to induce implicit toxicity in language models. Can you explain in detail the components of this RL framework, including the policy model, reward model, and optimization strategy? 

2. The paper collects the supervised learning data by prompting an instruction-tuned language model. What are the benefits of using this automatic data collection method compared to relying on human annotations? What are potential limitations?

3. The paper trains a separate reward model to provide reward signals that prefer implicit toxic responses. Why is directly using the negative confidence score from an existing toxicity classifier insufficient? What techniques does the paper propose to improve the effectiveness of the reward model?

4. The paper shows the attack success rate increases as the model scale becomes larger. What are possible explanations for this observation? Does it suggest potential risks of extra-large language models?  

5. The results show optimizing without the reward model Rθ leads to reduced toxic probability. Why does removing Rθ steer the model towards non-toxic responses rather than implicit toxic ones? What role does Rθ play?

6. How does the paper analyze the linguistic features and reasoning required to detect the generated implicit toxic examples? What does this analysis reveal about the challenges faced by current toxicity classifiers?

7. The paper shows fine-tuning classifiers on annotated examples from the attacking method improves toxicity detection abilities. Why can't we directly use existing datasets? What additional benefits are provided by the generated challenging examples?

8. What techniques does the paper adopt during reinforcement learning optimization to mitigate the over-optimization issue of the reward model? How do they balance implicit toxicity and fluency of generated responses? 

9. What possibilities could the paper explore regarding further enhancing the attack success rate and effectiveness of the proposed method? For instance, how can the quality and efficiency of comparison data annotation be improved?

10. What limitations currently exist regarding evaluating the attack performance on extra-large language models? How can we extend experiments to models like LLaMA-65B and monitor potential risks as model scale continues advancing?
