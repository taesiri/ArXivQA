# [Comparing Abstraction in Humans and Large Language Models Using   Multimodal Serial Reproduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03618)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Humans can form useful abstractions from noisy sensory inputs, which is key for general intelligence. It is unclear how language influences human abstractions and whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 exhibit similar abstraction abilities as humans. 

- Most prior work studying abstraction through iterative paradigms like serial reproduction uses only a single modality. However, humans often communicate abstractions through multiple modalities like vision and language.

Method:
- The paper introduces a multimodal serial reproduction paradigm where participants alternate between transmitting a visual stimulus and a linguistic description to study the effect of language. 

- Unimodal (vision-only) and multimodal (vision+language) chains were collected from both humans (on Amazon Mechanical Turk) and GPT-4 using simple 7x7 binary grid stimuli.

Results:
- Adding language as a transmission modality leads to more compressible/abstract stimuli for humans but has less of an effect for GPT-4.

- Language is more predictive of complexity in human multimodal boards versus unimodal boards, suggesting human visual and linguistic representations are more dissociable.

- GPT-4 relies on linguistic representations by default even in a vision-only paradigm. Its visual and linguistic representations seem tightly coupled, likely due to how vision-language models are trained.

Contributions:
- A novel multimodal serial reproduction paradigm to study effect of language on abstraction.

- Evidence that GPT-4's visual and linguistic representations are much closer than those of humans.

- Suggests humans have more distinct representations in vision versus language modalities compared to GPT-4.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a multimodal serial reproduction paradigm to study abstraction in humans and machines, finding that adding language as a transmission modality impacts human reproductions more than GPT-4's, suggesting human visual and linguistic representations are more dissociable than GPT-4's.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal and analysis of a novel multimodal serial reproduction framework to study abstraction. Specifically:

1) The paper theoretically analyzes how comparing unimodal vs multimodal serial reproduction chains allows one to assess whether distinct priors are being used to make inferences in different modalities. 

2) The paper implements a multimodal serial reproduction paradigm in both humans and machines (GPT-4), where chains alternate between visual and linguistic stimuli. This allows studying the effect of transmitting information through multiple modalities on the abstractions that emerge.

3) Through quantitative analysis of the human and machine chains, the paper provides evidence that adding language as a transmission modality has a bigger effect on human reproductions than on GPT-4's. This suggests human visual and linguistic representations are more dissociable than those of GPT-4.

In summary, the key contribution is using a multimodal serial reproduction framework to demonstrate differences in the abstract visual and linguistic priors of humans vs. machines. This provides a new experimental paradigm for studying abstraction and representation in AI systems compared to humans.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel multimodal serial reproduction paradigm. How does this expand upon traditional unimodal serial reproduction studies? What new insights can be gained from incorporating language as an additional modality?

2. The theoretical analysis suggests comparing unimodal and multimodal chains can reveal differences in priors used for different modalities. What assumptions does this analysis make? How valid are these assumptions for modeling human cognition?  

3. What are some limitations of using binary grid stimuli? How could the paradigm be expanded to more complex/realistic visual stimuli? What new challenges might emerge?

4. The paper ran relatively short chains of 10 iterations. What effect could longer chains have? Would the results still hold over longer timescales? 

5. How were the measures of board complexity (KC, entropy, LSC) selected? What aspects of complexity do they each capture? Are there other useful measures that could provide additional insights?

6. The language embeddings were obtained using a pretrained SentenceTransformers model. How might performance change with embeddings tailored to this task or stimuli? 

7. Could the decoding analysis be expanded beyond predicting scalar complexity to actually reconstructing board patterns from language? What would this show about how language represents visual concepts?

8. The paper speculates on differences in how vision and language are represented in humans vs. GPT-4. What further analyses could elucidate these representational differences? 

9. How do the emergent multimodal distributions compare to actual human linguistic descriptions of random binary grids? Are there still noticeable gaps?

10. The paper discusses hybrid human-machine chains. What kinds of shared human-machine abstractions might emerge from such collaborations? How could these provide insight on developing AI for human-centric tasks?
