# [Progressive Disentangled Representation Learning for Fine-Grained   Controllable Talking Head Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14506)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How to achieve disentangled and fine-grained control over multiple facial motions, including lip motion, head pose, eye gaze & blink, and emotional expression, for controllable talking head synthesis from a single image?

The key hypothesis is that representing the different facial motions with disentangled latent features and learning an image generator conditioned on them enables such fine-grained control over the synthesized talking heads.

In summary, the paper focuses on disentangled and controllable talking head synthesis by learning disentangled motion representations in a progressive manner and leveraging an image generator for controllable synthesis. The main research question is how to achieve disentangled control over diverse facial motions given unstructured video data.
