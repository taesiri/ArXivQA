# [Fluctuation-based Adaptive Structured Pruning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11983)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have hundreds of billions of parameters, making them very costly to deploy and run inferences on. Existing model compression techniques like pruning are not feasible at this scale. Structured pruning reduces parameters and speeds up inference without specialized hardware, but requires new metrics to evaluate the importance of entire rows/columns. However, current LLM pruning metrics only consider individual weights, not whole structures.

Proposed Solution - FLAP:
This paper proposes a structured pruning framework called FLuctuation-based Adaptive Structured Pruning (FLAP) that meets 3 criteria:

1) Structured importance metric: FLAP proposes a "fluctuation metric" that measures variation of each input channel relative to its baseline value on calibration samples. This estimates recoverability of output if a column is removed.

2) Adaptive search for global compression: Scores are standardized across layers/modules for unified comparison. An adaptive search identifies the globally optimal compressed structure. 

3) Bias compensation to minimize performance loss: Additional bias terms using baseline values are added to recover output maps. This avoids expensive retraining.

Main Contributions:
- First retraining-free structured pruning method for LLMs 
- Introduces bias compensation to replace retraining for performance recovery
- Outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods without any retraining
- Maintains accuracy and speeds up inference, enabling efficient deployment

The method is evaluated on the LLaMA family, outperforming techniques like LLM-Pruner and Wanda extensions while avoiding retraining. This facilitates the deployment of efficient LLM models for various applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel retraining-free structured pruning framework for Large Language Models named FLAP, which determines the recoverability of output features when removing weight columns based on a fluctuation metric, adaptively searches the compressed model structure, and uses baseline values to add biases to recover performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel retraining-free structured pruning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) named FLAP. Specifically, the key contributions highlighted in the paper are:

1) Identifying the characteristic of structured sample stability in LLMs and using this to develop a bias compensation mechanism for recovering model performance after pruning, without requiring retraining. 

2) Designing a structured pruning metric that estimates the fluctuation of each input feature relative to a baseline value, to determine if an output feature map can be recovered when a column of weights is removed.

3) Employing a strategy to standardize the pruning metric scores across layers and modules to enable adaptive determination of the global compressed model structure.

4) Demonstrating that the proposed framework, FLAP, achieves remarkable performance on a variety of language benchmarks and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods without any retraining.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel retraining-free structured pruning framework for LLMs that leverages the identified characteristic of structured sample stability to enable effective pruning and performance recovery through bias compensation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Structured pruning - The paper focuses on structured pruning methods for large language models, which prune entire rows/columns of weights rather than individual weights.

- Retraining-free - The proposed FLAP method does not require any model retraining or fine-tuning after pruning, which is important for scaling to large models. 

- Bias compensation - FLAP uses a bias compensation mechanism based on baseline feature values to recover model performance after pruning, avoiding expensive retraining.

- Fluctuation metric - A novel structured importance metric proposed that estimates the recoverability of output features when input features are removed, based on feature fluctuation.  

- Adaptive structure search - An adaptive method to determine the layer-wise and module-wise pruning ratios to find the optimal global compressed model structure.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper evaluates FLAP on the LLaMA family of large transformer language models from Meta.

- Performance recovery - The paper emphasizes techniques like bias compensation to mitigate performance degradation after aggressive structured pruning.

So in summary, the key themes are around retraining-free structured pruning of LLMs using novel techniques like the fluctuation metric and bias compensation for performance recovery.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel structured pruning metric called "Weighted Input Feature Variance (WIFV)". How is this metric calculated? What are the key components and what role does each component play in formulating this metric?

2. The paper highlights the need for an adaptive search mechanism for the global compressed model structure. Why is this adaptivity important? How does the paper standardized the pruning metrics across layers and modules to enable a unified search?

3. The paper employs a bias compensation mechanism using baseline values to recover performance after pruning, avoiding expensive retraining. What is the intuition behind using the baseline values for this purpose? How are these baseline values calculated? 

4. In the ablation studies, the paper evaluates different combinations of pruning metrics and global model structures. What were the key findings? Which global model structure consistently worked the best across metrics?

5. The authors claim that the bias compensation in their method essentially serves a similar function to that of LoRA fine-tuning. Can you elaborate on why this is the case? What parallels can be drawn between the two techniques?

6. Structured pruning operates by removing entire rows/columns of weights rather than individual weights. What are the main advantages of structured over unstructured pruning, especially in the context of deploying Large Language Models?

7. The paper demonstrates superior performance over the previous SOTA method, LLM-Pruner. What limitations of LLM-Pruner does the proposed approach aim to address? Where does it still fall short?

8. The calibration dataset plays an important role in estimating input feature statistics in this method. How robust is the approach to the choice and size of this dataset based on the ablation experiments?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on the LLaMA model family. What considerations would be necessary if aiming to apply this method to other large transformer-based language models?

10. The method does not require any retraining or fine-tuning. What are the limitations of this approach? When would a light-touch fine-tuning still be preferred after pruning?
