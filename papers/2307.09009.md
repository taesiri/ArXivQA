# [How is ChatGPT's behavior changing over time?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09009)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How does the performance and behavior of large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 change over time as the models are updated? 

The authors evaluate different versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 from March 2023 and June 2023 on tasks like math problem solving, answering sensitive questions, code generation, and visual reasoning. Their goal is to quantify whether the models have improved or gotten worse on these tasks over this time period. The underlying hypothesis seems to be that the performance and behavior of these LLMs can drift substantially even over a relatively short 3-4 month time frame as the models are updated. The authors aim to demonstrate and characterize this drift through their evaluations.

In summary, the key research question is whether and how the performance of widely-used LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 changes over time, which the authors investigate by comparing different versions of the models on diverse evaluation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is that it evaluates and analyzes the longitudinal drifts (changes over time) in the behavior of two large language models (LLMs), GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which are the backbone of ChatGPT. 

Specifically, the paper compares the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four diverse tasks:

1. Solving math problems
2. Answering sensitive/dangerous questions 
3. Generating code
4. Visual reasoning

The key findings are:

- The performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary substantially over time on these tasks. 

- For example, GPT-4 went from very good at identifying prime numbers in March (97.6% accuracy) to very poor in June (2.4% accuracy). Interestingly, GPT-3.5 became much better on this task over time.

- GPT-4 became less willing to answer sensitive questions directly in June compared to March.

- Both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting mistakes when generating code in June versus March. 

- There were only marginal improvements in visual reasoning over time.

Overall, the paper demonstrates that the behavior of LLMs can shift significantly even over a short timeframe. This highlights the need for continuous monitoring and evaluation of LLMs in production settings. The main contribution is providing evidence that LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are not static and their capabilities can vary greatly over time.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper finds that the behavior and performance of large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can change substantially over time, even over just a few months, highlighting the need to continuously monitor their capabilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper comparing to other research on evaluating and analyzing language models over time:

- The focus on evaluating longitudinal drift in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is novel. Most prior work has focused on one-time evaluations of LLMs or comparing different model versions cross-sectionally. Tracking changes in the same models over time provides unique insights.

- The choice of tasks is fairly standard - math, sensitive questions, code generation, visual reasoning are all common areas for LLM evaluation. The use of accuracy, answer rate, executability, and exact match as metrics is also typical. 

- The scale of the study in terms of number of samples evaluated on each task is relatively small compared to some prior work. For instance, the Anthropic safety evaluations used 27k samples across 29 tasks. This is understandable given the focus on temporal comparison rather than comprehensive one-time benchmarking.

- The analysis of specific examples to hypothesize reasons for performance changes is illuminating. Looking at how chain-of-thought, verbosity, formatting, etc. change provides insights beyond just aggregate metrics.

- The study is limited to two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and two time points so far. Expanding to more models and a longer time period would strengthen the conclusions. The authors acknowledge this limitation and propose longer-term monitoring.

- Releasing the evaluation data and model outputs is a great step towards reproducibility and enabling further research.

Overall, this appears to be a solid initial study on an important under-explored area. Expanding the breadth and duration of the benchmarking will be valuable future work. The analysis provides a template for monitoring production LLM API quality over time.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Conduct a more comprehensive study evaluating GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 drifts using more datasets, tasks, and metrics. The current study only scratches the surface with a limited set of datasets and metrics. A larger study could reveal new insights into how these models change over time.

- Evaluate different interaction modes with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, such as conversational turns versus single-turn prompts. The drifts may manifest differently based on how users interact with the models.

- Analyze what specific model or data changes are causing the drifts. The current work focuses on detecting drifts, but understanding the underlying causes could further inform monitoring and mitigation strategies. 

- Develop methods to automatically monitor and detect drifts in LLM services at scale. The current analysis relies on manual evaluation, but automated approaches could enable continuous monitoring.

- Study techniques to mitigate negative drifts and ensure stable performance of LLM services over time. The work exposes concerning performance declines, so developing ways to maintain quality is an important avenue.

- Release benchmark datasets, prompts, and model responses to facilitate reproducibility and promote further research on monitoring LLM drifts.

In summary, the authors call for expanded study along multiple dimensions to gain a more complete understanding of how and why large language models drift over time in real-world deployments. Developing scalable monitoring techniques and mitigation strategies is critical to ensuring safe and robust integration of LLMs into downstream applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four diverse tasks - solving math problems, answering sensitive questions, generating code, and visual reasoning - using March 2023 and June 2023 versions of the models. It finds substantial drifts in the models' abilities over this time period. For example, GPT-4's accuracy on identifying prime numbers dropped dramatically from 97.6% to 2.4%, while GPT-3.5's accuracy improved from 7.4% to 86.8%. Both models generated less directly executable code in June than March. GPT-4 was also less willing to answer sensitive questions in June but provided less explanation when refusing. The results highlight the need to continuously monitor large language models, as their capabilities can vary significantly over time.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates how the performance and behavior of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 has changed over time by comparing versions from March 2023 and June 2023. The authors test the models on four diverse tasks: solving math problems, answering sensitive questions, generating code, and visual reasoning. 

They find substantial differences between the March and June versions of both models across the tasks. For example, GPT-4's accuracy on determining prime numbers dropped from 97.6% to 2.4% while GPT-3.5's accuracy improved from 7.4% to 86.8%. GPT-4 also became less willing to answer sensitive questions directly. Both models generated code with more formatting issues and fewer directly executable snippets in June compared to March. The authors conclude that the behavior of these large language models can vary significantly even over a short timeframe, highlighting the need to continuously monitor model performance. Their results demonstrate drifts in model capabilities that can impact downstream applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for evaluating and analyzing the longitudinal drifts of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and ChatGPT. The authors select two major versions of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 (from March 2023 and June 2023) and evaluate their performance on four diverse tasks: solving math problems, answering sensitive questions, generating code, and visual reasoning. For each task, they use standard datasets or construct new ones, and define quantitative metrics to measure the models' performance such as accuracy for math, answer rate for sensitive questions, executability for code generation, and exact match for visual reasoning. By comparing these metrics between the March and June versions of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, they are able to quantify the drift in the models' capabilities over time. Their approach provides a simple but effective framework to continuously monitor the behavior of LLMs by evaluating them on representative tasks using well-defined metrics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper seems to address the following main problem:

How do the behaviors of large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 change over time, and what are the implications of these changes? 

The key questions the paper seems to be exploring are:

- When and how are GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 updated? This is currently opaque/not transparent.

- Do GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 consistently improve over time, or can updates aimed at improving some capabilities reduce performance on other tasks?

- How much can the behavior of the "same" large language model service drift over a relatively short period? 

To study this, the authors evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 from March 2023 and June 2023 on diverse tasks like math problems, sensitive questions, surveys, multi-hop reasoning, code generation, medical exams, and visual reasoning.

The main findings are:

- Performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 varied significantly between March and June, sometimes getting much worse on certain tasks.

- Behavior like following instructions and verbosity also changed substantially.

- Improvements on some tasks correspond to unintended side effects on others.

- There is a need to continuously monitor model behaviors over time.

So in summary, the key problem is understanding how large language models change over time, since their updating is non-transparent but can impact reliability if behaviors shift. The study evaluates this concretely for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and finds considerable drift over a short period.
