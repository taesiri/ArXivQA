# [Modelling Political Coalition Negotiations Using LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modelling political coalition negotiations is important for predicting government formations and stability. However, it has been an under-explored area in NLP due to lack of suitable datasets. 
- Existing approaches for modelling human negotiations have limitations in reasoning depth and ability to capture complex, iterative processes.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new multilingual dataset, PolCA, comprising manifestos of European political parties and corresponding coalition agreements.
- Formulate coalition negotiation as interactions between LLM-based agents in a hierarchical Markov decision process (HMDP). 
- The HMDP has two levels - a high level policy for selecting which statement to negotiate, and a lower level policy for taking actions (support, oppose, refine etc) during negotiations.
- LLMs like GPT-3.5 are used as the backbone for the negotiating agents.

Key Contributions:  
- First comprehensive dataset specifically designed for modelling coalition negotiations
- Novel task formulation as HMDP-based LLM agents
- Analysis of state-of-the-art LLMs in capturing the complex dynamics of political negotiations
- Insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for political modelling tasks

The paper demonstrates initial promising results in using the dataset and HMDP framework for simulating coalition negotiations. It provides a strong foundation for future advancements in developing algorithms that can accurately model the outcomes of multiparty political negotiations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new dataset and hierarchical Markov decision process approach for modeling complex political coalition negotiations between large language model agents representing different parties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Introducing a new multilingual dataset, PolCA, for modelling political coalition negotiations. This dataset contains manifestos of European political parties and their corresponding coalition agreements.

2) Proposing a novel method to model coalition negotiations as a hierarchical Markov decision process (MDP) between large language model (LLM)-based agents. Each party is represented by an LLM agent that learns policies to negotiate and tries to maximize its own benefits.

3) Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs as agents on this coalition negotiation task on the PolCA dataset. The results demonstrate the capability but also limitations of current LLMs in capturing the complexity of real-world political negotiations.

In summary, the paper presents a new dataset to enable research on modelling political negotiations, proposes a novel LLM-based simulation method for this task, and provides an initial investigation and analysis of LLMs' performance on simulating such complex negotiation processes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Coalition negotiations - The paper models the complex negotiations between political parties aiming to form a governing coalition.

- Manifestos - The policy declarations made by political parties outlining their positions, which form the basis for coalition negotiations. 

- Coalition agreements - The final agreements reached between parties in a coalition, reflecting the compromises made.

- Large language models (LLMs) - State-of-the-art neural language models like GPT-3 that are used as negotiation agents.

- Markov decision process (MDP) - The paper models coalition negotiations as an MDP to simulate the sequential decision making.

- Hierarchical MDP - A two-level MDP proposed to capture different aspects of the negotiation process. 

- Dataset - The paper introduces a new multilingual dataset of party manifestos and coalition agreements.

- Evaluation - Different LLMs are evaluated on modeling coalition negotiations using the proposed approach.

In summary, the key terms cover the political negotiation modeling task, the dataset, the MDP-based modeling approach, and the LLMs used as negotiating agents.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical MDP framework to model the coalition negotiation process. What are the key advantages of using a hierarchical structure compared to a flat MDP? How does it allow the model to capture different aspects of the negotiation?

2. The paper uses LLMs like GPT-3.5 as the agents in the negotiation process. Why are LLMs well-suited for this task compared to rule-based or traditional ML agents? How can their commonsense reasoning and language understanding abilities help? 

3. The model learning involves policy updates at both the high level (which statement to discuss) and low level (how to negotiate the statement). What mechanisms are used for policy learning at each level? How is the credit assignment done?

4. The paper reports lower performance of LLaMa models compared to GPT-3.5. What factors contribute to this gap? How can LLaMa be improved to close this gap?

5. Error analysis shows that sometimes the LLM generates invalid outputs like non-existing statement IDs. How can this issue of inconsistent outputs be addressed? Would techniques like constrained text generation help?  

6. How suitable is the annotation process for multi-party negotiations involving more than 2 parties? Would the context provided to the LLM be sufficient to determine inclusion in such cases?

7. What additional real-world complexities around coalition negotiations is the current model not yet able to capture? How can the model/data be extended to account for factors like seat distributions, partner preferences etc.?

8. The model currently operates on short text snippets. How can it be extended to process and connect the broader manifestos and agreements as a whole rather than individual statements?

9. Could improved custom LLM architectures specifically for political negotiations outperform the broad LLMs tested so far? What capabilities would such architectures need?

10. The paper focuses on European countries with established democracies. How transferable is this approach to countries with less stable political systems or less rich data? What adaptations would be needed?
