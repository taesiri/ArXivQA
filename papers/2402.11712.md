# [Modelling Political Coalition Negotiations Using LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modelling political coalition negotiations is important for predicting government formations and stability. However, it has been an under-explored area in NLP due to lack of suitable datasets. 
- Existing approaches for modelling human negotiations have limitations in reasoning depth and ability to capture complex, iterative processes.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new multilingual dataset, PolCA, comprising manifestos of European political parties and corresponding coalition agreements.
- Formulate coalition negotiation as interactions between LLM-based agents in a hierarchical Markov decision process (HMDP). 
- The HMDP has two levels - a high level policy for selecting which statement to negotiate, and a lower level policy for taking actions (support, oppose, refine etc) during negotiations.
- LLMs like GPT-3.5 are used as the backbone for the negotiating agents.

Key Contributions:  
- First comprehensive dataset specifically designed for modelling coalition negotiations
- Novel task formulation as HMDP-based LLM agents
- Analysis of state-of-the-art LLMs in capturing the complex dynamics of political negotiations
- Insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for political modelling tasks

The paper demonstrates initial promising results in using the dataset and HMDP framework for simulating coalition negotiations. It provides a strong foundation for future advancements in developing algorithms that can accurately model the outcomes of multiparty political negotiations.
