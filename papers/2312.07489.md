# [NearbyPatchCL: Leveraging Nearby Patches for Self-Supervised Patch-Level   Multi-Class Classification in Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07489)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning method called Nearby Patch Contrastive Learning (NearbyPatchCL) for robust representation learning from whole-slide images (WSIs). It treats adjacent patches as positive samples in a supervised contrastive framework to maximize similarity between augmented views and nearby patches of the same center patch. Additionally, it uses a decoupled contrastive loss to eliminate the negative pair contrast effect for more stable learning. The method is evaluated on a new benchmark dataset called P-CATCH, derived from the CAnine CuTaneous Cancer Histology dataset, for patch-level multi-class classification. Experiments demonstrate that NearbyPatchCL significantly outperforms supervised baselines and other state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, achieving 87.56% top-1 accuracy with only 1% labeled data. Key benefits are leveraging spatial structure in WSIs to obtain more reliable positive pairs during self-supervised pre-training, and the decoupled loss addresses class imbalance issues. This shows promise for self-supervised learning in computational pathology applications involving limited annotations.
