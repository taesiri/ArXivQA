# [Product-Level Try-on: Characteristics-preserving Try-on with Realistic   Clothes Shading and Wrinkles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11239)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing virtual try-on methods fail to simultaneously preserve the fine details (textures, logos, embroideries) of the in-shop clothes (static characteristics) while generating realistic shadows and folds (dynamic features) that change according to the pose of the person and lighting conditions. They either overly preserve the warped in-shop clothes using predicted masks, resulting in incoherent lighting, or use GANs which struggle at high resolutions.

Solution:
The paper proposes a product-level try-on (PLTON) method to address this. The key ideas are:

1) Adaptive Dynamic Rendering: Uses a pre-trained diffusion model as a generative prior. A dynamic extractor is trained from scratch to generate dynamic tokens that preserve semantic information from compressed in-shop clothes. This allows generating realistic wrinkles and shadows. 

2) Static Characteristics Transformation: A high-pass filter extracts a High-Frequency Map (HF-Map) from the warped clothes to focus on fine details. A static extractor uses this to generate modulation maps that are injected into the diffusion model to synthesize the output.

3) Two-Stage Blended Denoising: First generates a low-res image, then uses that to guide high-res image generation. This strengthens retention of details and allows controlling the degree of dynamic feature generation.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new product-level virtual try-on paradigm to replace the traditional split-transform-merge pipeline, by decoupling it into static and dynamic characteristics.

- Shows how to effectively fine-tune large diffusion models with limited paired training data through fixed priors and conditional guidance.

- Achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on high-resolution datasets, generating images with preserved details and realistic wrinkles/shadows.

The method is robust and efficient, requiring only a small dataset and single GPU for training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a product-level virtual try-on method called PLTON that uses a diffusion model to separately render the static and dynamic characteristics of clothing items, enabling both preservation of details like textures and logos as well as generation of realistic wrinkles and shadows.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a product-level virtual try-on pipeline called PLTON based on diffusion priors. Specifically:

1) It decouples the clothing image generation process into adaptive dynamic rendering and static characteristics transformation. This allows generating realistic dynamic features like shadows and wrinkles while preserving fine details like textures and logos. 

2) It introduces a Dynamic Extractor module to extract dynamic tokens from the input clothes image to guide the diffusion model to generate realistic dynamic features.

3) It introduces a Static Extractor module to extract a high-frequency map (HF-Map) from the warped clothes to help preserve static characteristics. 

4) It proposes a two-stage blended denoising method to strengthen retention of static features and allow adjusting the degree of dynamic feature generation.

5) It achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results on high-resolution virtual try-on with a small collected dataset and limited compute, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of PLTON.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new diffusion-based product-level virtual try-on paradigm called PLTON that can generate realistic dynamic features while preserving static fine details.
