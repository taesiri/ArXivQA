# [Sequential Flow Matching for Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Continuous-time generative models like diffusion models and flow-based models have shown impressive results in image generation and other domains. A key challenge is the slow sampling speed from these models when using ODE solvers, due to the exploding global truncation error caused by high curvature of the ODE trajectories. This limits their practical usage and scaling to more complex datasets. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new method called Sequential Rectified Flow (SeqRF) to straighten the probability flow and reduce the global truncation error to enable faster and higher quality sampling from flow-based models. The key ideas are:

(1) Divide the ODE trajectory into multiple segments over time. Generate joint distributions by partially traversing the solver rather than full trajectories. This reduces global truncation error accumulation.

(2) Use the generated joint distributions to further train the flow models. This straightens the vector field in each segment, reducing curvature and Lipschitz constants. 

(3) Distill the trained multi-segment model into a single-segment model for each time segment. This allows traversing an entire time segment in one function evaluation.

Main Contributions:

- Identify global truncation error of ODE solvers as a key factor limiting sampling speed and quality of continuous-time generative models

- Propose SeqRF method to segment the ODE trajectory and generate joint distributions to straighten the probability flow in each segment

- Demonstrate SeqRF reduces Lipschitz constants and straightens vector fields per segment theoretically and empirically 

- Achieve state-of-the-art image sample quality with only 6 function evaluations on CIFAR-10 using SeqRF, significantly faster than previous flow-based approaches

The main novelty is in using joint distributions over time segments to straighten the probability flow in each segment and reduce truncation error growth. This enables faster high-quality sampling from the trained generative models.
