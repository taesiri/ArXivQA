# [StableIdentity: Inserting Anybody into Anywhere at First Sight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15975)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for customized image generation struggle to achieve stable identity preservation, flexible editability, and efficiency when learning from just a single input image. Methods based on finetuning tend to overfit and lose editability. Encoder-based methods require large datasets and fail to capture distinctive identities and details. The learned identities are also inconsistent across different contexts.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes StableIdentity, a framework to enable identity-consistent image generation from a single input face image. The key ideas are:

1) Incorporate identity prior by using a face recognition ViT encoder to extract distinctive identity features from the input image. 

2) Incorporate editability prior by constructing an editable celeb name embedding space using 326 celeb names. The identity features are projected into this space via AdaIN to make the learned identity editable like a celeb name.

3) Design a masked two-phase diffusion loss with specialized objectives focused on pixel-level detail in the early phase and diversity in the later phase. This perceives details better while allowing adaptation to diverse contexts.

Main Contributions:

1) StableIdentity allows high-quality identity-consistent image generation from just a single input image, through effectively incorporating identity and editability priors.

2) The proposed masked two-phase diffusion loss enables more stable identity learning and identity-consistent diversity.

3) Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, editability, and image quality compared to previous customization methods.

4) Remarkably, StableIdentity generalizes to enable identity-consistent video and 3D generation by directly injecting the learned identity into off-the-shelf models without any finetuning. This could contribute to unifying image, video and 3D customization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes StableIdentity, a framework that incorporates identity and editability priors to enable identity-consistent image recontextualization from a single input face image, which can also generalize to video and 3D generation without finetuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

1. It proposes StableIdentity, a customized generation framework that incorporates identity prior and editability prior to enable identity-consistent recontextualization with just one face image.

2. It designs a masked two-phase diffusion loss to perceive pixel-level details and learn more stable identity for diverse generation. 

3. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is effective and prominent. Remarkably, it can not only combine with image-level modules like ControlNet, but also unlock the generalization ability that the identity learned from a single image can achieve identity-consistent customized video/3D generation without finetuning.

So in summary, the main contributions are: proposing the StableIdentity framework, designing a novel training loss, and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on customized image generation as well as zero-shot generalization to video and 3D generation.
