# [Few-shot Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Signal-surface Collaborative   Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15367)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we reconstruct hidden non-line-of-sight targets from a minimal number of measurements? 

Specifically, the authors aim to develop a method that can faithfully reconstruct hidden targets with complex geometric structures using only a very sparse set of measurements (e.g. 5x5). This is challenging because with so few measurements, the inverse problem of reconstructing the target is severely ill-posed and prone to noise.

To address this, the key ideas proposed are:

1) Designing a joint regularization approach that incorporates priors on the estimated signal, the 3D voxel representation of the target, and a 2D surface representation of the target. 

2) Modeling the inherent randomness in the photon detection process using a Bernoulli model of photon arrivals. This leads to a log-likelihood data fidelity term.

3) Solving the resulting optimization problem in a collaborative manner with block coordinate descent, alternating between estimating the signal, voxels, and surface.

The main hypothesis is that by combining these ideas - joint regularization, log-likelihood data model, and collaborative optimization - it will be possible to faithfully reconstruct complex hidden targets from extremely sparse measurements. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research question is how to reconstruct complex NLOS targets from minimal measurements, with the central hypothesis being that a joint signal-surface regularization approach can achieve this. The experiments aim to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.
