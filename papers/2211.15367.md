# [Few-shot Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Signal-surface Collaborative   Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15367)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we reconstruct hidden non-line-of-sight targets from a minimal number of measurements? 

Specifically, the authors aim to develop a method that can faithfully reconstruct hidden targets with complex geometric structures using only a very sparse set of measurements (e.g. 5x5). This is challenging because with so few measurements, the inverse problem of reconstructing the target is severely ill-posed and prone to noise.

To address this, the key ideas proposed are:

1) Designing a joint regularization approach that incorporates priors on the estimated signal, the 3D voxel representation of the target, and a 2D surface representation of the target. 

2) Modeling the inherent randomness in the photon detection process using a Bernoulli model of photon arrivals. This leads to a log-likelihood data fidelity term.

3) Solving the resulting optimization problem in a collaborative manner with block coordinate descent, alternating between estimating the signal, voxels, and surface.

The main hypothesis is that by combining these ideas - joint regularization, log-likelihood data model, and collaborative optimization - it will be possible to faithfully reconstruct complex hidden targets from extremely sparse measurements. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets aim to validate this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research question is how to reconstruct complex NLOS targets from minimal measurements, with the central hypothesis being that a joint signal-surface regularization approach can achieve this. The experiments aim to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel signal-surface collaborative regularization (SSCR) framework for few-shot non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. Specifically:

- They propose joint regularizations of the estimated signal, the 3D voxel-based representation of the objects, and the 2D surface-based description of the targets to enable robust reconstructions from very sparse measurements. This is the first work to combine regularizations in mixed dimensions for hidden targets.

- They report reconstruction of hidden targets with complex geometry using only 5x5 confocal measurements on public datasets, representing an acceleration factor of 10,000 compared to conventional scanning.

- The method enables low time and memory complexity NLOS imaging with sparse measurements. For example, with a constant number of measurements, the time complexity is O(L^3) compared to O(L^3 log L) for other methods.

- Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate efficiency and robustness of the proposed method in confocal and non-confocal settings. It outperforms previous regularization-based and interpolation-based methods.

In summary, the key innovation is the collaborative 2D/3D regularization framework that makes robust few-shot NLOS imaging possible, with potential for real-time applications like autonomous driving and rescue operations. The efficiency and performance gains are validated experimentally.
