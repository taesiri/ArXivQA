# [Crosslingual Generalization through Multitask Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How does multitask prompted finetuning of large multilingual language models impact their ability to generalize to new tasks and languages in a zero-shot setting?

The key hypotheses tested in this work are:

1) Finetuning large multilingual LMs on English tasks/data improves generalization to non-English languages seen only during pretraining.

2) Finetuning on multilingual tasks/data further boosts generalization in both English and non-English languages. 

3) Finetuning on machine translated prompts improves performance on human-written prompts in those languages.

4) Models exhibit surprising generalization to entirely new languages never intentionally seen, likely by learning higher-level capabilities that are language/task agnostic.

In summary, the paper investigates cross-lingual transfer through multitask prompted finetuning and the effects on zero-shot generalization capabilities of multilingual LMs. Experiments on models like mT5 and BLOOM support the hypotheses that finetuning improves generalization, with multilingual finetuning and prompting providing additional benefits.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How can multitask prompted finetuning of large multilingual language models improve their zero-shot crosslingual generalization capabilities?

Specifically, the authors investigate:

- Whether finetuning large multilingual LMs on English tasks/data is enough to improve zero-shot performance on non-English tasks.

- Whether adding multilingual tasks/data to the finetuning (in addition to English) can further improve crosslingual generalization. 

- The effects of using machine translated vs original language prompts during multitask finetuning.

- Whether models can generalize to entirely unseen languages. 

The key hypothesis appears to be that multitask prompted finetuning on a diverse set of tasks and languages can teach models higher-level language-agnostic capabilities that transfer across languages and tasks in a zero-shot setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Investigating crosslingual multitask prompted finetuning of large language models. The authors apply multitask finetuning to the multilingual BLOOM and mT5 models and analyze the resulting crosslingual task generalization capabilities.

2. Developing xP3, an extension of the P3 multitask training dataset to 46 languages. xP3 adds new tasks like translation and program synthesis. The authors use xP3 to finetune BLOOM and mT5, producing the BLOOMZ and mT0 models.

3. Studying the effect of training with English vs. multilingual prompts. The authors create a machine-translated variant of xP3 called xP3mt and find training on translated prompts improves performance on human-written non-English prompts.

4. Discovering that finetuned models can generalize to tasks in languages never explicitly seen during pretraining or finetuning. The authors hypothesize the models learn some language- and task-agnostic capabilities.

5. Analyzing multitask finetuning dynamics like scaling behavior, the effect of language proportions, and biases towards short text generation. The authors propose solutions to maintain strong generative performance.

In summary, the key contribution is advancing the understanding and techniques for crosslingual transfer and generalization in large multilingual language models via prompted multitask finetuning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The paper focuses on crosslingual generalization through multitask finetuning of large multilingual language models. This is a relatively new area of research compared to more established techniques like translation or transferring from high-resource languages.

- The authors use prompted finetuning rather than the typical supervised finetuning. This allows them to leverage the pretrained knowledge of models like BLOOM and mT5 in a zero-shot setting without additional labeled data. Prompted finetuning has become popular recently for improving task generalization.

- The scale of the models used, up to 176B parameters, is much larger than a lot of prior work on crosslingual transfer learning. The authors find these huge models can generalize to unseen languages, while most prior work studies smaller models.

- The training corpus xP3 covers 46 languages and is likely one of the largest and most diverse prompted finetuning datasets. Prior multilingual finetuning datasets tend to be smaller or English-focused.

- Comparing BLOOM vs mT5 lets the authors contrast different model architectures (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder) and pretraining objectives (autoregressive vs masked language modeling). They find the encoder-decoder mT5 outperforms the decoder-only BLOOM given the same parameters.

- The paper introduces rigorous testing of zero-shot generalization through held-out evaluation tasks in many languages. Much prior work evaluates only on natural language inference or translation tasks.

Overall, the paper pushes the boundaries on scale and linguistic diversity for crosslingual finetuning compared to related work. The broad empirical findings on model architectures and prompting techniques contribute significantly to the field.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper explores crosslingual generalization through multitask finetuning of large multilingual language models. Other research has also looked at crosslingual transfer, but has focused more on transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages after training on English data. This paper takes a broader approach by finetuning on multilingual data.

- The paper shows strong results on zero-shot crosslingual transfer, outperforming prior work like XGLM. The key factors seem to be the model scale, training data diversity, and prompting methodology. This highlights the importance of those factors for crosslingual capabilities.

- The analysis of finetuning on machine translated prompts is novel. Prior work has mainly used English prompts, even for non-English data. This paper shows translations can further improve multilingual performance, at a cost to English accuracy.

- The investigation of unseen language generalization is interesting. The authors posit the models learn some language-agnostic capabilities. More analysis could further test this hypothesis and try to understand what knowledge transfers across languages.

- The models and methods build directly on recent work like mT5, BLOOM, and prompt tuning. The innovations are more on the training data and prompting side. In terms of models and objectives, this doesn't propose fundamentally different techniques.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art for crosslingual learning in large language models. The focus on multilingual finetuning and prompts is notable, as most prior work looked at transfer learning after English training. The results demonstrate the promise of this approach, especially for low-resource languages. More analysis on the source of transfer could further elucidate the crosslingual learning process.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating multitask finetuning of models that were pretrained on even more languages than mT5's 101 languages. The authors suggest that finetuning on the full 101 languages seen during mT5's pretraining could lead to better performance.

- Enhancing xP3 with more datasets and prompts, such as via BIG-Bench or NL-Augmenter. Adding more training data could further improve the models' capabilities.

- Exploring different modifications to the multitask finetuning procedure itself, such as mixing in more long-form tasks, using different loss weightings, or varying other hyperparameters. The authors mention several tweaks that could potentially yield better models.

- Finetuning better base models before multitask finetuning. The authors suggest investigating models that were pretrained with more optimal compute allocation, datasets, objectives and model architectures.

- Studying whether the models can learn new languages from scratch during finetuning, not just improve on languages seen during pretraining. The authors did not evaluate on new finetuning languages.

- Analyzing and addressing remaining failure modes of the models such as on longer text generation. The authors recognize there is still room for improvement.

In summary, the main suggested directions are enhancing the training data and process, starting with better base models, and comprehensively evaluating on more languages and tasks including longer generative ones. The overarching goal is to further improve multitask finetuning for cross-lingual zero-shot generalization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigating multitask finetuning on better base models. The authors mention that the pretrained BLOOM and mT5 models used in this work are suboptimal in various aspects like compute allocation, pretraining datasets, pretraining objectives, and possibly model architecture. Finetuning better base models could lead to improved performance.

- Exploring different modifications to the multitask finetuning recipe, such as loss weighting, mixing long and short tasks, and various multilingual training techniques. The authors experimented with some of these but there is more to explore.

- Training models on more languages, tasks and prompts. The authors created xP3 with 46 languages, but mT5 was pretrained on over 100 languages. Expanding finetuning to more languages could further improve multilinguality. Similarly, adding more tasks and prompts has been shown to help generalization.

- Studying whether models can learn new languages only from the finetuning data. The authors focused on generalization to pretrained languages, but did not extensively evaluate learning completely new languages.

- Investigating if models learn higher-level multilingual and task-agnostic capabilities. The authors hypothesize the models may learn such abilities but more analysis is needed to confirm.

- Addressing various failure modes and deficiencies that still exist in large language models after finetuning, such as infactual generations, inability to understand context, etc.

- Analyzing the effect of language proportions in pretraining and finetuning corpora on model capabilities in each language.

So in summary, the main suggestions are to explore improvements to models, training schemes, datasets and evaluation, with the goal of unlocking even more powerful multilingual multi-task abilities.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper introduces xP3, a multilingual multitask dataset used to finetune BLOOM and mT5 models, showing English-only finetuning improves non-English task performance and multilingual finetuning leads to state-of-the-art crosslingual results, including on languages never seen during pretraining or finetuning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores crosslingual multitask prompted finetuning of large language models. The authors develop xP3, a multilingual dataset covering 46 languages, and use it to finetune the BLOOM and mT5 model families. They find that finetuning on English data improves performance on non-English tasks, and adding multilingual data further helps. The finetuned models generalize to unseen languages, indicating they learn some language-agnostic capabilities. Comparing English and machine-translated prompts shows the latter helps for non-English tasks. For generative tasks, the authors find finetuning makes models biased towards short text, but this can be mitigated by forcing longer generations at inference. Overall, multitask finetuning, especially on multilingual data, improves zero-shot crosslingual generalization of large models. The datasets and models are released publicly.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates crosslingual multitask prompted finetuning of large language models. The authors develop xP3, a corpus of tasks in 46 languages, and use it to finetune the pretrained multilingual BLOOM and mT5 models. They find that finetuning on English tasks improves performance on non-English languages seen during pretraining. Further finetuning on multilingual xP3 leads to state-of-the-art results, with models generalizing even to unseen languages.

They find training on translated prompts significantly improves performance on human-written non-English prompts. Interestingly, models can generalize to tasks in languages never intentionally seen during pretraining or finetuning. The authors hypothesize the models are learning higher-level crosslingual capabilities. In addition to strong zero-shot results, this work provides insights into multitask finetuning of multilingual models and releases datasets to facilitate future research.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates crosslingual multitask prompted finetuning of large language models. The authors construct xP3, a dataset covering 46 languages and new tasks like translation and program synthesis. They finetune the multilingual BLOOM and mT5 models on xP3 to produce BLOOMZ and mT0 variants. The finetuned models show improved zero-shot performance on held-out evaluation tasks compared to the pretrained models, with benefits from finetuning on English tasks transferring to non-English languages. Further gains are achieved by finetuning on the multilingual xP3 over just English P3 data. Surprisingly, the models can even generalize to unseen languages not explicitly included in pretraining or finetuning, likely picking up signal from tiny amounts of "contamination" data. Comparing English and machine-translated non-English prompts reveals translated prompts boost performance on human-written non-English prompts after finetuning with them. However, this comes at a cost to English performance. Overall, the paper demonstrates techniques to improve multilingual zero-shot task generalization in large models. The authors release models, code and datasets to enable further research.

This paper investigates crosslingual multitask prompted finetuning of large language models like BLOOM and mT5. The authors build an extended multitask dataset called xP3 covering tasks in 46 languages and use it to finetune BLOOM into BLOOMZ and mT5 into mT0.
