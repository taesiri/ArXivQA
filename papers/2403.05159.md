# [LVIC: Multi-modality segmentation by Lifting Visual Info as Cue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most current multi-modality fusion pipelines for LiDAR semantic segmentation have complicated fusion mechanisms. Point painting is a straightforward method which directly binds LiDAR points with visual information. However, previous point painting methods suffer from projection errors between the camera and LiDAR. The paper finds that this projection error is the key issue limiting the effectiveness of point painting. 

Proposed Solution - LVIC:  
The paper proposes a new Depth Aware Point Painting mechanism and a new point painting pipeline called LVIC (Lifting Visual Info as Cue):

1. Depth Aware Point Painting: Uses the difference between depth estimated from vision and the LiDAR point depth as a confidence measure of whether the visual feature extracted is valid for that LiDAR point. This significantly reduces issues due to projection errors.

2. Visual Encoder: Uses an efficient vision transformer backbone with a depth decoder to extract dense visual features and depth estimation. 

3. Painting Module: Projects each LiDAR point to an image pixel using calibration. Paints each LiDAR point with the pixel coordinates, estimated depth, and visual features.

4. Fusion Module: Fuses the geometric LiDAR features and painted visual features using simple linear layers, using the estimated depth difference as a cue on whether to rely more on visual or LiDAR features.


Main Contributions:

1. A more simple and effective point painting method for multi-modality semantic segmentation.

2. A depth aware module to help reduce issues due to projection errors between LiDAR and camera. 

3. State-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes LiDAR semantic segmentation leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

In summary, the paper presents LVIC, a novel point painting approach using depth awareness and simple visual feature lifting that achieves leading performance for LiDAR semantic segmentation.
