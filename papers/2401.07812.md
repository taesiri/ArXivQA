# [Wikidata as a seed for Web Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Wikidata is a large and impressive knowledge graph with over 17 billion facts. However, most knowledge on the web exists in unstructured or semi-structured HTML pages rather than structured knowledge graphs. 
- Manually finding, monitoring, and organizing this web data into Wikidata is very difficult and time-consuming for human editors due to the sheer volume and complexity of data.
- Existing solutions like domain-specific scrapers do not scale well, cannot handle subtag expressions in HTML, and extract text spans that are too broad rather than the precise facts needed.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a framework called WebExtractor that uses Wikidata as a seed to train neural networks to extract new structured facts from HTML pages to propose for addition to Wikidata.
- Cast the web extraction task as an extractive question answering problem to exploit capacities of language models without needing additional labeling. 
- Questions are formed using Wikidata property names and web pages serve as the context documents.
- Models are first fine-tuned on SQuAD QA dataset, then further tuned on Wikidata training data automatically constructed using existing Wikidata facts.
- The framework links extracted answers back to Wikidata items using a learned linker.

Main Contributions:
- Show language models can extract facts from HTML without additional labeling by framing as QA task.
- Demonstrate the framework works well across domains and properties in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised scenarios.  
- Propose a way to link extracted text spans back to Wikidata entities.
- Estimate the framework could potentially contribute millions of new facts to Wikidata to help editors and improve completeness.
- Publish pretrained Roberta-Base-WebExtractor model adapted for web extraction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework called WebExtractor that uses Wikidata as a seed to train neural networks to identify and extract new facts published on external websites, with the goal of proposing new facts for validation by Wikidata editors to help complete the Wikidata knowledge graph.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Showing that language models can be trained to extract facts from HTML content without needing additional labeling beyond what's already in Wikidata. This allows training extractors for websites connected to Wikidata without human intervention.

2) Proposing an extraction framework that covers structured, semi-structured and unstructured web data in HTML pages by casting it as an extractive question answering task.

3) Publishing RoBERTa-Base-WebExtractor, a pretrained deep learning model adapted for web extraction in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios with high accuracy. 

4) Presenting a technique to link extracted textual evidence to Wikidata entities. 

5) Estimating that the proposed approach can potentially extract millions of facts from the web that can be proposed to Wikidata editors for validation, helping to complete the Wikidata knowledge graph.

In summary, the main contribution is using Wikidata as a seed to train QA models for web extraction, allowing completing Wikidata without needing additional labeling.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the paper frame web extraction as an extractive question answering task? What is the intuition behind this approach?

2. The paper mentions adapting language models for web extraction without additional labeling. How exactly does it generate training data from Wikidata in an unsupervised manner?

3. What modifications were made to the RoBERTa model's vocabulary and architecture to handle HTML content? 

4. How does the paper handle extraction from structured, semi-structured and unstructured web data using the same framework?

5. What strategies are used for linking extracted text to the correct Wikidata entities? How does the paper deal with entity ambiguity?

6. What is the zero-shot performance of the framework on new domains? How effectively can the model adapt with a small number of examples?

7. How does pre-training the language model specifically for web extraction impact the performance in few-shot and zero-shot settings?

8. What differences were observed in extraction capabilities across the domains and properties analyzed? What may explain domains with poorer performance?  

9. How did the paper estimate the framework's potential to contribute new facts to Wikidata? What assumptions were made?

10. What are some challenges and limitations in deploying this extraction framework in practice? How can the techniques be improved further?
