# [UniTraj: A Unified Framework for Scalable Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15098)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles, but relies heavily on the specific data distribution used for training. This causes issues when models encounter new environments with different data distributions at test time.
- However, studying model generalization across datasets is challenging due to discrepancies in data formats, map resolutions, annotation types, etc. between different trajectory prediction datasets. 
- In addition, the impact of larger dataset sizes on model generalization remains under-explored.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce UniTraj, an open-source framework that seamlessly integrates multiple trajectory prediction datasets into a unified format. It also includes several state-of-the-art models and evaluation strategies.
- Using UniTraj, the authors study: (1) model generalization across datasets/cities (RQ1), and (2) the impact of larger dataset sizes on performance (RQ2).

Key Findings:  
- Models show significant performance drops when evaluated on new datasets/cities, indicating generalization issues. Performance order: Waymo > Argoverse > nuScenes.
- Increasing dataset size & diversity through multi-dataset training leads to performance improvements without changing model architecture. Establishes new SOTA on nuScenes leaderboard.
- Analysis reveals dataset generalization capability depends on both size & diversity. Waymo has most diverse data.

Main Contributions:
- UniTraj framework that unifies datasets, models and evaluations for vehicle trajectory prediction. Enables more comprehensive research. 
- Extensive experiments showing model generalization issues across datasets/cities.
- Demonstration that larger and more diverse datasets enhance model performance and generalization ability.
- In-depth analysis providing insights into dataset characteristics to explain experimental findings.
