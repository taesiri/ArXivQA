# [Collective Counterfactual Explanations via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04579)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Collective Counterfactual Explanations via Optimal Transport":

Problem:
- Counterfactual explanations (CE) provide the minimum-cost action for an individual to reach a favorable outcome from an algorithmic system. However, CE can recommend outlier actions and lead to unintended competition if many individuals follow the advice. 

- CE ignores the underlying data distribution and is focused on optimizing cost for each individual separately. This can concentrate recommendations in low-density regions near the decision boundary.

- If many individuals follow CE advice, it can significantly alter the cost function and create new competition in areas recommended by CE. This demonstrates the "tragedy of the commons".

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes collective counterfactual explanations (CCE) to address the issues with CE. 

- CCE relies on optimal transport theory to collectively transition individuals from negative to positive regions in a cost-efficient way.

- A "delta-confidence" region is defined along the decision boundary that targets areas with sufficient density. This avoids recommending outlier positions.

- CCE spreads recommendations across this target region to prevent over-concentration and competition.

- CCE provides a collective transition cost and respects the underlying density, unlike individualized CE.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates CCE as an optimal transport problem to address key limitations of CE.

- Interprets CCE cost as a "competition equilibrium" in a market setting. This helps estimate costs in real-world applications.

- Extends CE to path-guided and ordered classifier scenarios using dynamic and constrained optimal transport.

- Analyzes CCE desiderata like actionability, sparsity, privacy over CE. Shows CCE augments these.

- Provides efficient computational methods like Sinkhorn and back-and-forth algorithms to estimate CCE.

- Overall, demonstrates CCE as a principled, robust and collective approach over classical individualized CE.
