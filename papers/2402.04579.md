# [Collective Counterfactual Explanations via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04579)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Collective Counterfactual Explanations via Optimal Transport":

Problem:
- Counterfactual explanations (CE) provide the minimum-cost action for an individual to reach a favorable outcome from an algorithmic system. However, CE can recommend outlier actions and lead to unintended competition if many individuals follow the advice. 

- CE ignores the underlying data distribution and is focused on optimizing cost for each individual separately. This can concentrate recommendations in low-density regions near the decision boundary.

- If many individuals follow CE advice, it can significantly alter the cost function and create new competition in areas recommended by CE. This demonstrates the "tragedy of the commons".

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes collective counterfactual explanations (CCE) to address the issues with CE. 

- CCE relies on optimal transport theory to collectively transition individuals from negative to positive regions in a cost-efficient way.

- A "delta-confidence" region is defined along the decision boundary that targets areas with sufficient density. This avoids recommending outlier positions.

- CCE spreads recommendations across this target region to prevent over-concentration and competition.

- CCE provides a collective transition cost and respects the underlying density, unlike individualized CE.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates CCE as an optimal transport problem to address key limitations of CE.

- Interprets CCE cost as a "competition equilibrium" in a market setting. This helps estimate costs in real-world applications.

- Extends CE to path-guided and ordered classifier scenarios using dynamic and constrained optimal transport.

- Analyzes CCE desiderata like actionability, sparsity, privacy over CE. Shows CCE augments these.

- Provides efficient computational methods like Sinkhorn and back-and-forth algorithms to estimate CCE.

- Overall, demonstrates CCE as a principled, robust and collective approach over classical individualized CE.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a collective approach for formulating counterfactual explanations using optimal transport to address issues with individual-centric methods, such as recommending outlier actions and accumulating data points near the decision boundary.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a collective approach for formulating counterfactual explanations, called "collective counterfactual explanations" (CCE). The key ideas are:

- Use optimal transport theory to recommend target states for individuals seeking to change their condition, taking into account the underlying population distribution. This avoids suggesting outlier states and accumulation of individuals in small regions near the decision boundary.

- Interpret counterfactual explanations as a market equilibrium, where the cost of change corresponds to the profit made by financial institutions in providing loans. This gives a valuable perspective for estimating subjective costs in real-world applications. 

- Extend counterfactual explanations along multiple dimensions, such as incorporating path information to give step-by-step explanations, handling ordered classifiers that have multiple decision boundaries, and framing the problem in terms of utility functions.

- Provide efficient computational methods like Sinkhorn algorithm and back-and-forth method to estimate the optimal transport map for collective counterfactual explanations.

In summary, the paper proposes a principled collective approach for counterfactual explanations that integrates ideas from optimal transport theory to address limitations like outlier recommendations, competition externalities, and security issues with the classic individual-centric counterfactual methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the collective counterfactual explanations method proposed in the paper:

1. How does framing the counterfactual explanations problem as an optimal transport problem help address issues like concentration of explanations in low density areas and introduction of new competition? Explain the intuition behind using optimal transport for collective counterfactuals.

2. Explain the concept of δ-confidence region. How is the choice of δ guided and how does it help with issues faced by traditional counterfactual explanations?

3. The paper interprets counterfactual explanations as a market equilibrium using the Kantorovich duality. Explain this connection and how it provides a valuable perspective for estimating costs in real-world applications.

4. How can constraints like actionability and sparsity be incorporated into the collective counterfactual explanations framework? Explain with examples. 

5. What is the displacement interpolation method and how can it be used to provide path-guided counterfactual explanations over time? Explain its connection to dynamic optimal transport.

6. Ordered classifiers and utility-based explanations are two extensions of the traditional counterfactual explanations problem. Demonstrate how optimal transport can be used to find counterfactuals in these scenarios.

7. Analyze the complexity and storage requirements of different optimal transport computational methods like Sinkhorn, Unbalanced Sinkhorn and Back-and-Forth. When is each suitable?

8. How do collective counterfactual explanations compare to traditional individualized counterfactuals across desiderata like actionability, sparsity, robustness and fairness? Provide examples to illustrate.

9. What assumptions are made about the feature space, classifiers, and cost functions when framing the counterfactual explanations problem under optimal transport? How valid are these assumptions in real applications?

10. The choice of target region uses distribution density, classifier level sets and cost functions. Analyze the impact each of these choices have on the counterfactual recommendations and discuss potential limitations.
