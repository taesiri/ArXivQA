# [Let Real Images be as a Judger, Spotting Fake Images Synthesized with   Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16513)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing fake image detection methods rely on spotting subtle differences between real and fake images. However, as generative models evolve, these differences change or even disappear, causing detectors to fail on new fake images.

- There is a need for a more practical fake image detection method that can generalize to unknown generative models rather than relying on ephemeral artifacts.

Solution - Natural Trace Forensics (NTF):
- The key insight is that real images have intrinsic "natural traces" that remain stable over time, whereas fake image artifacts continually change.

- NTF trains the detector using these natural traces as an additional target alongside real/fake classification. It brings real images closer to the natural traces and separates fakes further away. This motivates decisions based on proximity to natural traces rather than artifacts.

- A self-supervised feature mapping mechanism is used to extract "homogeneous features" from real images as a proxy for natural traces. Soft orthogonality constrains independence between homogeneous and heterogeneous features.

- An extended supervised contrastive loss brings real image features closer to homogeneous features and pushes fakes further away. A classifier is also trained on real vs fake images.

Contributions:
- Built a diverse dataset of fake images from 6 GANs, 6 diffusion models and multi-step methods to enable more comprehensive evaluation.

- NTF achieves 96.1% average precision across GAN/DM/multi-step fakes, significantly outperforming baselines. It generalizes much better to unknown generative models.

- Robustness experiments show NTF withstands common perturbations like blur and JPEG compression. It also achieved 78.4% accuracy on challenging Midjourney-generated images.

- The focus on real image commonalities rather than fake image differences provides a new perspective to make fake detection more practical.
