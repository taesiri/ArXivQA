# [ESFL: Efficient Split Federated Learning over Resource-Constrained   Heterogeneous Wireless Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in efficiently utilizing resources on heterogeneous devices and central server. Simply assigning identical resources/workloads to devices with varying capabilities leads to inefficiencies.
- Existing methods like federated averaging (FedAVG) do not address resource heterogeneity across devices. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Efficient Split Federated Learning (ESFL) to optimize utilization of heterogeneous resources in FL systems. 
- ESFL strategically splits model between server and devices to allocate appropriate workload based on device capabilities. It also allocates server-side computing resources accordingly.
- A mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) is formulated to jointly optimize resource allocation and model splitting. An iterative algorithm with low complexity is used to find an approximate solution.

Key Contributions:
- Design of ESFL framework to improve training efficiency of split federated learning by considering device heterogeneity.
- Formulation of joint optimization problem for resource allocation and model splitting and development of iterative algorithm to solve it. 
- Extensive experiments showing ESFL significantly reduces overall training time compared to Federated Learning, Split Learning and Split Federated Learning under different resource constraints and heterogeneity scenarios.
- Analysis of how ESFL is able to effectively utilize heterogeneity in system resources/device capabilities to optimize machine learning outcomes and efficiency.

In summary, the key innovation is the strategic workload allocation between end devices and server alongside dynamic resource allocation on server to address challenges in federated learning systems with heterogeneous devices. Experiments demonstrate superior time efficiency of the proposed approach.
