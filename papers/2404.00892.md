# [Realization of Seated Walk by a Musculoskeletal Humanoid with   Buttock-Contact Sensors From Human Constrained Teaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Locomotion for humanoid robots typically focuses on bipedal walking without environmental contact. However, humans often use environmental contact to assist locomotion (e.g. using handrails). Realizing such locomotion is challenging for robots due to sensing/modeling limitations and robot rigidity constraining movement.

- The paper focuses on realizing "seated walk", where a robot sits on a movable chair and moves by pushing with its legs against the ground. This is challenging for musculoskeletal humanoids which have complex flexible structures difficult to model and control.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement "buttock-contact sensors" by inserting pressure sensors into the planar interskeletal structure mimicking the gluteus maximus muscle. This allows measuring pressure between the buttocks and chair for balance control.

- Develop a "constrained teaching method" where a 1D control command and explicit transition conditions are predefined. Thresholds for the transition conditions are learned from human demonstration. This allows complex motions to be generated from simple 1D inputs.

- Combine the above to realize seated walk on the musculoskeletal humanoid "MusashiOLegs". Forward, backward and rotational seated walk movements are achieved.

Main Contributions:
- Development of buttock-contact sensors utilizing the planar interskeletal structure of musculoskeletal humanoids
- Implementation of a constrained teaching method that generates complex motions from 1D inputs by learning only transition condition thresholds 
- First realization of seated walk by a musculoskeletal humanoid and demonstration of combined translational and rotational movement to carry objects

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed hardware sensor implementation and software control solutions, the specific seated walk motions achieved, and highlights the main contributions around utilizing the unique characteristics of musculoskeletal humanoids to achieve this new locomotion ability.
