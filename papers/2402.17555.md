# [Scribble Hides Class: Promoting Scribble-Based Weakly-Supervised   Semantic Segmentation with Its Class Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17555)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing scribble-based weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods rely on diffusing labels from annotated pixels to unlabeled ones using local cues, failing to leverage global semantics. 
- They are also heavily dependent on quantity/quality of scribbles, performing poorly when scribbles are shrunk or dropped.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a class-driven scribble promotion network that utilizes image-level classes from scribbles to generate globally-aware pseudo-labels for supervision.
- Introduce a localization rectification module (LoRM) to correct foreground representations in feature space misled by noisy pseudo-labels.  
- Propose a distance entropy loss (DEL) to identify reliable predictions by assigning confidence based on proximity to scribbles and pseudo-label boundaries.

Main Contributions:
- First approach to exploit image-level class information from scribbles in scribble-based weakly-supervised segmentation.
- LoRM effectively rectifies foreground representations by referencing features of other same-class pixels.
- DEL reduces model uncertainty by weighting predictions according to reliable regions from scribbles and pseudo-labels.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on ScribbleSup dataset and demonstrates robust performance when scribbles are shrunk/dropped.

In summary, the paper presents a novel class-driven framework to promote scribble-based segmentation by generating globally-aware pseudo-labels. The LoRM and DEL components further improve robustness to noisy pseudo-labels. Experiments verify state-of-the-art performance and exceptional robustness of the proposed approach.
