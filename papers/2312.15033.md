# [Sparsity-Guided Holistic Explanation for LLMs with Interpretable   Inference-Time Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like BERT and GPT have achieved great success in natural language processing. However, their black-box nature makes them difficult to interpret and limits transparency, accountability, and real-world applicability. Prior interpretability methods for LLMs either provide only local explanations (e.g. attention weights) lacking high-level intuition, or global explanations (e.g. concepts) lacking granular reasoning details. There is a need for more comprehensive LLM interpretability.

Proposed Solution - Sparse Concept Bottleneck Models (SparseCBMs):
The paper proposes SparseCBMs to provide holistic LLM interpretability spanning local to global views. SparseCBMs incorporate predefined human-intuitive concepts into LLM bottlenecks like existing Concept Bottleneck Models, but additionally use sparsity techniques to carve the LLM into concept-specific subnetworks. This enables tracing decision pathways from input tokens through concepts to predictions.  

Key Contributions:

(1) SparseCBMs match LLM performance while offering multi-dimensional interpretability - tokens, subnetworks, concepts. The sparsity decomposition does not degrade utility for enhanced interpretability.

(2) SparseCBMs allow efficient, interpretable test-time intervention. By slightly adjusting concept-specific sparsity masks, errors can be corrected without full retraining. Users gain insights into the specific parameters causing mispredictions.  

(3) Thorough experiments on CEBaB and IMDB-C datasets validate SparseCBM advantages over regular fine-tuning and vanilla concept bottlenecks across various backbone sizes. The framework is highly practical.

In summary, SparseCBMs pioneer more transparent and interactive LLMs via a synergy of bottlenecks and sparsity, enhancing trust and usability. The work lays groundwork for continued advances at this interpretability-utility frontier.
