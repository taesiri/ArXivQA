# [Seeing is Believing: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language   Models via CLIP-Guided Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15300)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are prone to object hallucination issues, where the generated text contains non-existent objects not present in the image. This limits reliability and utility.
- Prior methods rely on model likelihood scores, instruction tuning, or complex external modules, each with limitations. 

Key Idea & Motivation 
- The paper first analyzes sentence-level hallucinations, finding that CLIP similarity acts as a stronger indicator compared to likelihood scores, especially for later sentences.
- Motivated by this analysis, the authors propose CLIP-Guided Decoding (CGD), which leverages CLIP models to enhance visual grounding and reduce hallucinations during decoding in a straightforward training-free approach.

Proposed Method
- CGD guides decoding by defining a reliability scoring function that mixes normalized likelihood and average CLIP similarity over generated sentences.
- Decoding follows a beam search process over sentences. Reliability scores help prioritize visually grounded sentences and mitigate hallucinations.

Experiments & Results
- Experiments over COCO and out-of-domain NoCaps datasets demonstrate CGD effectively reduces hallucination while maintaining utility.
- Evaluation over an open-ended VQA benchmark shows competitive performance, with particular improvements in recognition and OCR tasks.

Main Contributions
- Analysis revealing CLIP's efficacy in identifying sentence-level hallucinations and patterns of increasing hallucination likelihood during generation
- CLIP-Guided Decoding approach that leverages CLIP similarity to mitigate hallucinations in a straightforward training-free manner
- Experiments demonstrating efficacy of proposed approach w.r.t. reducing hallucinations and maintaining generation quality
