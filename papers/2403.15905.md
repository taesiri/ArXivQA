# [Towards Low-Energy Adaptive Personalization for Resource-Constrained   Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying ML models on IoT/mobile devices faces challenges of data drift and model personalization. Fine-tuning a full model or last few layers may not achieve optimal performance for different types of drifts. 
- Resource constraints of devices require energy-efficient solutions. Full model fine-tuning has high energy costs.

Proposed Solution:
- Categorize data drift into input-, feature-, and output-level types. 
- Propose Target Block Fine-Tuning (TBFT) to only fine-tune the block of the model corresponding to the drift type. For input-, feature- and output-level drifts, fine-tune the front, middle, and rear blocks of the model respectively.

- Show through initial experiments that adding noise to a specific block and then fine-tuning that block achieves better accuracy than fine-tuning other blocks or full model.

Contributions:
- Introduce the idea of targeted block-based fine-tuning for personalized adaptation. 
- Achieve improved accuracy over average block performance by 15.3% on average.
- Reduce energy consumption compared to full model fine-tuning by 41.57% on average.

Overall, the paper presents TBFT as an adaptive, energy-efficient personalization solution for resource constrained devices. By only fine-tuning the relevant block for a drift type, it can achieve better model performance than average block or full model fine-tuning, with significantly lower energy costs.
