# Maieutic Prompting: Logically Consistent Reasoning with Recursive   Explanations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that prompting large language models (LMs) to recursively generate explanations can lead to more logically consistent reasoning, even if the individual explanations are noisy or unreliable. Specifically, the paper proposes a method called "Maieutic Prompting" which generates a tree structure of explanations in an abductive and recursive manner. It then models the logical relationships between these explanations and uses a symbolic inference algorithm (MAX-SAT) to find the optimal truth value assignments that maximize consistency. The key idea is that by generating many layered explanations in a tree structure and modeling their logical relations, the approach can infer the correct answer even if some of the individual explanations are incorrect. This allows it to overcome the limitation that LMs often generate logically inconsistent or unreliable explanations when prompted for a single explanation.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that recursive, structured explanation generation combined with symbolic logical inference can substantially improve logical consistency in LM reasoning, despite the inherent unreliability of individual model-generated explanations. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Maieutic Prompting to improve the logical consistency and reasoning capability of large language models (LMs) through recursively generating and resolving explanatory statements. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Proposes a novel inference method called Maieutic Prompting that generates a tree structure of explanatory statements (abductively for both possible answers and recursively to validate the explanations) for a given question, defines logical relationships between them, and uses a MAX-SAT solver to find the best consistent assignments.- Aims to improve logical reasoning consistency of LMs by modeling and resolving relationships between possibly noisy or contradictory explanatory statements.- Achieves significantly better accuracy (up to 20% higher) compared to prior prompting methods on commonsense reasoning benchmarks while being competitive with supervised models.- Shows improved robustness against semantic perturbations and across different prompt examples/orders compared to other prompting methods.- Provides an interpretable framework to understand the model's reasoning process through the generated explanatory statements and their logical relationships.- Introduces the concepts of logical integrity and maieutic tree to recursively elicit, validate and relate the knowledge from language models.Overall, the key novelty is in developing a framework to recursively generate explanatory statements in a tree structure, model logical relationships between them, and infer consistent answers, which improves reasoning capability of LMs in an unsupervised manner. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this method empirically on reasoning tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called Maieutic Prompting that generates a tree of recursive explanations from a language model to logically reason about the answer to a question, framing it as a satisfiability problem to infer consistent truth values.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a new method called "Maieutic Prompting" for improving logical reasoning capabilities in large language models through recursive explanation generation. Here are some key ways it compares to related work:- Explanation-based prompting has been explored in several recent works as a way to improve reasoning in LMs. However, this paper finds that model-generated explanations are often logically inconsistent or unreliable. Maieutic Prompting aims to address this limitation.- The paper introduces two key novelties - abductive explanation generation and depth-wise recursive prompting to build a tree structure of explanations. This allows collecting a diverse set of possibly contradicting explanations and resolving them through weighted MAX-SAT inference. - Unlike methods that aggregate independent explanation samples, Maieutic Prompting models relationships between explanations using logical constraints and symbolic inference. This provides more robustness compared to answer aggregation.- The approach runs fully unsupervised, requiring only a pretrained language model. It does not need training on human demonstrations or annotations. This makes it more generalizable.- Experiments show the method outperforms prior prompting techniques by a large margin and achieves competitive results with supervised models on challenging reasoning tasks.- The paper demonstrates the approach can provide interpretability into the model's inference through the generated explanation tree.Overall, this work makes notable improvements over prior prompting and explanation generation techniques through a novel recursive prompting approach and logical inference framework. The unsupervised nature and interpretability are also benefits compared to supervised models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending their method to different task formats beyond validating a statement, such as multiple-choice QA. They suggest binarizing the multiple choices into statements and scoring them with their method.- Generalizing the modeling of relationships beyond a single tree, such that knowledge generated for one question could serve as evidence for another question. They suggest modeling relationships between questions as a direction for enriching the elicited knowledge.- Exploring different decoding strategies during tree generation, as they found the tree size and decoding scheme impacted performance.- Evaluating the approach on a broader range of datasets and task formats to further analyze its effectiveness and generalizability.- Incorporating additional mechanisms for dealing with inaccurate or unhelpful explanations generated by the language model.- Studying how to best incorporate human feedback or annotations to further improve the inference process and handle ambiguities. - Analyzing different configurations and hyperparameters of the approach through further ablation studies.- Developing enhanced prompting techniques to generate higher quality explanations as input to their framework.In summary, the key directions are extending the approach to new tasks and datasets, generalizing modeling of explanations, leveraging human feedback, and further analysis and improvements to the tree generation, prompting, and inference components. The authors propose several interesting ideas for building on their method.
