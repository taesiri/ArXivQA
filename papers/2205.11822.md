# [Maieutic Prompting: Logically Consistent Reasoning with Recursive   Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11822)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that prompting large language models (LMs) to recursively generate explanations can lead to more logically consistent reasoning, even if the individual explanations are noisy or unreliable. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called "Maieutic Prompting" which generates a tree structure of explanations in an abductive and recursive manner. It then models the logical relationships between these explanations and uses a symbolic inference algorithm (MAX-SAT) to find the optimal truth value assignments that maximize consistency. 

The key idea is that by generating many layered explanations in a tree structure and modeling their logical relations, the approach can infer the correct answer even if some of the individual explanations are incorrect. This allows it to overcome the limitation that LMs often generate logically inconsistent or unreliable explanations when prompted for a single explanation.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that recursive, structured explanation generation combined with symbolic logical inference can substantially improve logical consistency in LM reasoning, despite the inherent unreliability of individual model-generated explanations. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Maieutic Prompting to improve the logical consistency and reasoning capability of large language models (LMs) through recursively generating and resolving explanatory statements. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes a novel inference method called Maieutic Prompting that generates a tree structure of explanatory statements (abductively for both possible answers and recursively to validate the explanations) for a given question, defines logical relationships between them, and uses a MAX-SAT solver to find the best consistent assignments.

- Aims to improve logical reasoning consistency of LMs by modeling and resolving relationships between possibly noisy or contradictory explanatory statements.

- Achieves significantly better accuracy (up to 20% higher) compared to prior prompting methods on commonsense reasoning benchmarks while being competitive with supervised models.

- Shows improved robustness against semantic perturbations and across different prompt examples/orders compared to other prompting methods.

- Provides an interpretable framework to understand the model's reasoning process through the generated explanatory statements and their logical relationships.

- Introduces the concepts of logical integrity and maieutic tree to recursively elicit, validate and relate the knowledge from language models.

Overall, the key novelty is in developing a framework to recursively generate explanatory statements in a tree structure, model logical relationships between them, and infer consistent answers, which improves reasoning capability of LMs in an unsupervised manner. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this method empirically on reasoning tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new method called "Maieutic Prompting" for improving logical reasoning capabilities in large language models through recursive explanation generation. Here are some key ways it compares to related work:

- Explanation-based prompting has been explored in several recent works as a way to improve reasoning in LMs. However, this paper finds that model-generated explanations are often logically inconsistent or unreliable. Maieutic Prompting aims to address this limitation.

- The paper introduces two key novelties - abductive explanation generation and depth-wise recursive prompting to build a tree structure of explanations. This allows collecting a diverse set of possibly contradicting explanations and resolving them through weighted MAX-SAT inference. 

- Unlike methods that aggregate independent explanation samples, Maieutic Prompting models relationships between explanations using logical constraints and symbolic inference. This provides more robustness compared to answer aggregation.

- The approach runs fully unsupervised, requiring only a pretrained language model. It does not need training on human demonstrations or annotations. This makes it more generalizable.

- Experiments show the method outperforms prior prompting techniques by a large margin and achieves competitive results with supervised models on challenging reasoning tasks.

- The paper demonstrates the approach can provide interpretability into the model's inference through the generated explanation tree.

Overall, this work makes notable improvements over prior prompting and explanation generation techniques through a novel recursive prompting approach and logical inference framework. The unsupervised nature and interpretability are also benefits compared to supervised models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending their method to different task formats beyond validating a statement, such as multiple-choice QA. They suggest binarizing the multiple choices into statements and scoring them with their method.

- Generalizing the modeling of relationships beyond a single tree, such that knowledge generated for one question could serve as evidence for another question. They suggest modeling relationships between questions as a direction for enriching the elicited knowledge.

- Exploring different decoding strategies during tree generation, as they found the tree size and decoding scheme impacted performance.

- Evaluating the approach on a broader range of datasets and task formats to further analyze its effectiveness and generalizability.

- Incorporating additional mechanisms for dealing with inaccurate or unhelpful explanations generated by the language model.

- Studying how to best incorporate human feedback or annotations to further improve the inference process and handle ambiguities. 

- Analyzing different configurations and hyperparameters of the approach through further ablation studies.

- Developing enhanced prompting techniques to generate higher quality explanations as input to their framework.

In summary, the key directions are extending the approach to new tasks and datasets, generalizing modeling of explanations, leveraging human feedback, and further analysis and improvements to the tree generation, prompting, and inference components. The authors propose several interesting ideas for building on their method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Maieutic Prompting for making large language models like GPT-3 more logically consistent in their reasoning. The key idea is to generate a tree structure of explanations for a given question by prompting GPT-3 to recursively provide supporting evidence for both possible answers (True/False). This creates a network of interrelated explanations that may contain inconsistencies. To resolve the contradictions, the method models the logical relationships between explanations using weights and converts it into a MAX-SAT problem. By solving for the assignment of truth values that maximizes satisfied logical constraints, the method can infer the most probable consistent answer to the original question. Experiments on question answering benchmarks show Maieutic Prompting improves accuracy and robustness over other prompting techniques and achieves competitive performance to supervised models. The framework provides an interpretable view into the model's reasoning process.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Maieutic Prompting to improve the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LMs) like GPT-3. The key idea is to generate a tree structure of explanations for a given question in an "abductive" and recursive manner. Specifically, the method prompts the LM to provide explanations that rationalize both possible answers (True and False) to a question, rather than just one explanation for the predicted answer. It then recursively validates the LM's confidence in each explanation by prompting again with that explanation as if it were a new question. This process results in a tree of propositions that establish logical grounds for one another. 

To make a final inference, Maieutic Prompting quantifies the LM's belief in each proposition based on its predictions for the proposition and its negation. It also defines consistency relations between propositions. Using these beliefs and relations as constraints, it formulates the inference as a satisfiability problem and employs a MAX-SAT solver to find the best truth value assignments. Experiments on question answering datasets show Maieutic Prompting substantially outperforms other prompting methods and achieves competitive performance to supervised models. Analyses also demonstrate it is more robust and provides interpretable rationales for the model's inferences.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Maieutic Prompting for making language models more logically consistent in their reasoning. The key idea is to recursively generate explanations in a tree structure that establish logical grounds for validating each other, forming what they call a "maieutic tree". Specifically, they first prompt the language model to generate abductive explanations that rationalize both possible answer choices (True and False) for a given question. Then, they recursively prompt the model with its own generations as follow-up questions, expanding the tree depth-wise. This elicits deeper recursive reasoning chains. They stop expanding a branch when reaching a "logically integral" proposition that the model is confident on. Finally, they use MAX-SAT to collectively assign truth values to all propositions in the tree that best satisfy the logical relations observed between them, which includes both the model's belief in each node and their consistency. This allows inferring an answer for the original question that is grounded in the most probable and logically consistent subset of the noisy generations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Pre-trained language models (LMs) like GPT-3 struggle with consistent reasoning when doing tasks like question answering. Generating explanations to guide the reasoning has emerged as a way to help LMs, but these approaches rely on the correctness of the explanations, which are often inconsistent themselves. 

- The paper proposes a method called "Maieutic Prompting" to address this issue. It generates a tree structure of explanations in an "abductive" and recursive way, modeling the logical relationships between them. 

- Even if individual explanations are unreliable, collectively resolving the logical relations can lead to a consistent answer. This is formulated as a satisfiability problem and solved with MAX-SAT.

- Experiments on question answering datasets show Maieutic Prompting improves accuracy over other prompting methods by up to 20% and achieves competitive results to supervised models.

In summary, the key problem is improving the logical reasoning capabilities of LMs through prompting, even when explanations are noisy. The paper proposes a way to generate recursive explanations in a tree structure and resolve them collectively.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Maieutic Prompting for improving the logical consistency of inferences made by large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. LLMs often generate inconsistent or illogical explanations when prompted to explain their reasoning, reducing their reliability. Maieutic Prompting aims to address this by generating a tree of explanations and modeling the relationships between them, even if the individual explanations are noisy or wrong. It prompts the LLM to recursively generate explanations that provide evidence for and against possible answers. These explanations are represented as nodes in a tree structure, with relationships quantified between nodes. The method then frames inference as a satisfiability problem, using a MAX-SAT solver to find the best truth value assignments to nodes that satisfy the most relationships. Experiments show Maieutic Prompting improves performance and robustness over other prompting methods on commonsense QA datasets. It also provides more interpretable rationales behind the LLM's inferences. Overall, the method offers a way to induce more consistent and logical reasoning from LLMs like GPT-3 in an unsupervised manner.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the Maieutic Prompting method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions generating explanations recursively to build a tree structure. How does the model determine when to stop recursively generating explanations for a given branch? Does it use a fixed depth limit or some adaptive criteria? 

2. The consistency weights between propositions are computed using the likelihoods assigned by the language model. What are some limitations of relying solely on the language model probabilities to determine logical consistency?

5. How does the model handle situations where none of the generated explanations are integral or logically consistent? Does the MAX-SAT inference still work reliably in such cases?

6. Could the recursive explanation structure enable more efficient knowledge aggregation compared to simply prompting for multiple independent explanations? Are there any theoretical guarantees on sample efficiency?

7. The human evaluation revealed a surprising number of helpful explanations even for incorrectly answered examples. What could be the reasons behind this observation? 

8. How does the model complexity of Maieutic Prompting compare to other prompting baselines? What are the major computational bottlenecks?

9. The method relies heavily on the pretrained capabilities of the language model. How could the approach be adapted for less capable or smaller language models?
