# [Top-$K$ ranking with a monotone adversary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers the top-K ranking problem using pairwise comparisons between items, which has applications like recommendation systems. The standard model is the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model.
- Prior work often assumes uniform random sampling of item pairs for comparison. This paper focuses on ranking under a "semi-random" or "monotone adversary" model, where an adversary can arbitrarily add more comparisons on top of a random graph.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using a weighted maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for top-K ranking under the semi-random model. Appropriate weighting of the graph can help mimic properties of the random graph.

- They provide a refined bound on the ∞-norm error of the weighted MLE explicitly in terms of spectral properties of the weighted graph (maximum degree, spectral gap). This avoids loose analyses from prior work.

- For computing good weights, they formulate a convex optimization problem based on maximizing the spectral gap. This saddle-point semidefinite program (SDP) can be efficiently solved approximately using a first-order Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update method.

Main Contributions:  
- Show that with proper reweighting, the weighted MLE achieves near optimal sample complexity for exact top-K recovery under the semi-random model, up to log factors.

- Provide novel ∞-norm analysis of weighted MLE that explicitly depends on spectral properties of the graph, unlike prior loose analyses. This analysis is general and tighter.

- Develop a computationally efficient SDP-based approach to reweight the semi-random graph and obtain desired spectral properties. The first-order method solves this approximately in nearly linear-time.

So in summary, the paper develops an analytically near-optimal and computationally efficient algorithm for top-K ranking under semi-random comparisons, which significantly expands the scope of ranking methods. The analysis also provides novel spectral characterizations that can have broader applicability.
