# [DynIBaR: Neural Dynamic Image-Based Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11082)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we synthesize high-quality novel views from long, in-the-wild monocular videos depicting complex dynamic scenes with uncontrolled camera motion and object motion? 

The key hypothesis is that by adopting an image-based rendering approach within a volumetric framework, the system can better handle complex object and camera motions in long videos compared to prior dynamic NeRF methods that encode the entire scene within MLP weights.

In summary, the paper aims to develop a novel view synthesis approach that:

1) Can handle long input videos (vs just 1-2 seconds for prior methods)

2) Works for complex, in-the-wild videos with uncontrolled camera motion and scene motion 

3) Achieves significantly higher rendering quality on dynamic regions compared to state-of-the-art dynamic NeRF methods

The central hypothesis is that an image-based rendering approach will be better able to meet these goals compared to canonical space methods like HyperNeRF or scene flow based methods like NSFF.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new approach for synthesizing novel views of complex dynamic scenes from a monocular video input. The key ideas are:

- Adopting an image-based rendering framework that aggregates features from nearby views to render novel views, rather than encoding the full dynamic scene in a canonical MLP model like recent dynamic NeRF methods. This makes the approach more scalable to long, complex videos.

- Adjusting feature aggregation based on estimated scene motion trajectories, which allows correctly reasoning about correspondences in dynamic scenes where epipolar constraints are violated. 

- Enforcing temporal consistency in the dynamic scene reconstruction through cross-time rendering losses.

- Improving rendering quality by factoring the scene into separate static and dynamic models, using motion segmentation masks derived from a lightweight pretrained model.

- Demonstrating significant improvements in rendering quality over prior state-of-the-art methods on benchmark dynamic scene datasets, as well as the ability to generate high-quality novel views on challenging in-the-wild videos.

In summary, the main contribution is a new dynamic scene representation that combines ideas from image-based rendering and recent neural volumetric modeling techniques to achieve higher quality view synthesis on complex, real-world dynamic videos compared to prior work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new approach for synthesizing novel views of dynamic scenes from monocular video that represents the scene using a volumetric image-based rendering framework which aggregates features from nearby views in a scene motion-aware manner to handle complex camera and object motions in long, unconstrained videos.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes:

- Overall approach: This paper proposes a new volumetric image-based rendering approach for novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes from monocular video. Most prior work in this area uses some form of neural radiance field representation. This paper argues that volumetric IBR provides benefits over NeRF-based methods for complex, long monocular videos.

- Handling dynamics: The key novelty is the motion-adjusted feature aggregation technique to handle scene dynamics. This is different from canonical space methods like Nerfies and HyperNeRF that deform a canonical scene, and from local scene flow methods like NSFF. The motion trajectory fields provide an efficient way to determine correspondences across views.

- Scaling: A main claim is the ability to scale to longer and more complex videos than prior work like NSFF and HyperNeRF. The trajectory fields and IBR formulation likely help with this. The masked reconstruction helps avoid bad local minima during optimization.

- Novel components: Other novel components include the cross-time rendering for temporal consistency, the learned motion bases, and the image-based motion segmentation within a Bayesian learning framework.

- Results: The method shows significant quantitative improvements over prior state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks. It also demonstrates good results on more challenging real-world videos where other methods fail.

- Limitations: It is limited to relatively small viewpoint changes compared to methods for static scenes. Rendering quality depends somewhat on source view selection. Not fully multi-view consistent compared to canonical NeRF methods.

Overall, this paper makes a solid contribution to monocular novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes by introducing a motion-aware volumetric IBR approach. The results demonstrate clear improvements in handling challenging real-world videos.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions the authors suggest:

- Exploring alternative scene motion representations beyond motion trajectory fields, such as neural motion fields, that could potentially handle faster and more complex motions. 

- Investigating other multi-view feature aggregation schemes, like attention-based aggregation, that could help render higher quality views.

- Extending the approach to support larger viewpoint changes by incorporating ideas from classic IBR techniques like view-dependent texture and geometry synthesis.

- Generalizing the approach to novel scenes without per-scene optimization, to make it more practical for real applications.

- Combining ideas from explicit geometric reconstruction to further regularize the learning and improve temporal stability.

- Exploring the use of videos with known camera poses to pretrain parts of the model to improve generalization.

- Applying the approach to other novel view synthesis tasks like free-viewpoint video, VR/AR, and novel view synthesis from multiple videos.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving the flexibility and generalizability of the approach through advances in scene motion modeling, feature aggregation, and learning methods.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new approach for synthesizing novel views from monocular videos of dynamic scenes. Recent methods based on dynamic neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results on this task, but struggle with long videos featuring complex camera and object motions. Instead of encoding the dynamic scene within MLP weights like dynamic NeRFs, this work adopts an image-based rendering (IBR) framework that renders novel views by aggregating image features from nearby input views. To handle scene motion, features are aggregated along motion-adjusted rays rather than static epipolar lines. The motion adjustment uses learned trajectory fields represented compactly with basis functions. The method also enforces temporal consistency by rendering views in a motion-adjusted way across time. To improve rendering quality, the scene is factored into static and dynamic components using segmentation masks from a separately trained IBR-based motion segmentation module. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art dynamic NeRF methods on benchmark dynamic scene datasets. The proposed approach also enables high-quality rendering on challenging in-the-wild videos where prior methods fail. Overall, this work advances the applicability of free-viewpoint rendering techniques to real-world dynamic videos by combining classical IBR ideas with recent neural scene representations.

In summary, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Adopts an IBR approach for dynamic view synthesis rather than encoding the scene in MLP weights like dynamic NeRFs. This aggregates image features from nearby views along motion-adjusted rays to handle scene dynamics.

- Represents scene motion compactly using learned trajectory basis functions for efficiency. Enforces temporal consistency by rendering views across time in motion-adjusted space. 

- Improves rendering quality by factoring the scene into static and dynamic components using masks from a trained IBR-based motion segmentation module.

- Achieves significant quantitative and qualitative improvements over state-of-the-art dynamic NeRF methods, and enables high-quality rendering on challenging real-world videos.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes from monocular video. The key idea is to represent the dynamic scene using a volumetric image-based rendering (IBR) framework instead of encoding radiance fields directly in MLP weights like recent dynamic NeRF methods. The approach synthesizes new views by aggregating image features from nearby source views in a scene motion-aware manner. Specifically, they introduce motion trajectory fields to efficiently model per-point trajectories across time, which are used to warp features from nearby views to the target ray. To enforce temporal consistency, they perform cross-time rendering where each frame is also rendered using a curved ray warped to a nearby time. The final rendering combines outputs from a static IBR model and dynamic model, which are supervised with segmentation masks predicted from a learned IBR-based motion segmentation module. Compared to prior dynamic NeRF methods, this approach shows improved novel view synthesis on complex dynamic scenes with long, unconstrained videos. The main benefit comes from the volumetric IBR framework that aggregates image evidence across views rather than relying solely on learned scene functions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos. More specifically, it aims to improve the quality and robustness of rendering novel views for long videos depicting complex dynamic scenes with uncontrolled camera motion and object motion. 

The key limitations it identifies with prior work like HyperNeRF and NSFF are:

- HyperNeRF struggles with complex object motion and uncontrolled camera trajectories, working best for object-centric videos with controlled camera paths. 

- NSFF is limited to short 1-2 second videos of mostly forward-facing motion, failing to scale to longer videos with complex camera motion.

So the main question the paper tries to address is how to achieve high quality free viewpoint rendering for long monocular videos of general dynamic scenes featuring complex and uncontrolled camera and object motion.
