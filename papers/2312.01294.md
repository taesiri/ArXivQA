# [Deep Ensembles Meets Quantile Regression: Uncertainty-aware Imputation   for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time series data often contains missing values due to various reasons like data corruption or human errors. Imputing these missing values (time series imputation) is critical for analyzing time series data and downstream applications.  
- Existing deep learning methods can impute missing values accurately but fail to quantify uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions. Bayesian neural networks can estimate uncertainty but are computationally expensive. Recently proposed score-based diffusion models like CSDI can produce accurate and probabilistic imputations but have very high computational complexity.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a computationally efficient time series imputation method called "Quantile Ensembles". 
- It incorporates deep ensembles into quantile regression in a parameter and computation efficient way by having multiple linear layers with different weights to model various quantiles while sharing the feature extraction backbone.
- This captures inherent uncertainties through quantile regression while not increasing computational complexity like multiple independent models. 
- The quantile ensemble is integrated with bidirectional RNNs which exploit temporal dependencies well for time series modeling.

Main Contributions:
- Novel quantile ensemble method to capture uncertainty in a computationally efficient manner by combining merits of deep ensembles and quantile regression
- Integrating quantile ensembles with bidirectional RNNs for accurate and probabilistic time series imputation
- Extensive evaluation on real-world health-care and air quality data showing the method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art in accuracy while being significantly more efficient than score based diffusion methods like CSDI

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient, accurate and reliable probabilistic time series imputation method using quantile ensembles.
