# [Hermite Neural Network Simulation for Solving the 2D Schrodinger   Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10649)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The Schrodinger equation is a key equation in quantum mechanics that describes the behavior of quantum mechanical systems. However, solving it accurately, especially in multidimensions, is challenging. 

- Existing methods like finite element methods are not efficient enough in domains like infinity where the Schrodinger equation is defined. Using neural networks to solve such differential equations has attracted recent attention.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using a mixture of neural networks and the collocation method based on Hermite functions to solve the Schrodinger equation accurately. 

- It uses the roots of Hermite functions as collocation points which improves efficiency. Since Hermite functions are defined in infinite domains, using them as activation functions in the neural network gives excellent precision.

- The method is simulated using MATLAB's Simulink tool to showcase solving the 2D Schrodinger equation.

Main Contributions:
- Defines a neural network architecture using Hermite functions as activation units to leverage their suitability for infinite domain problems.

- Obtains the collocation points from Hermite function roots that aid in faster convergence and improved accuracy.

- Compares performance against Physics-Informed Neural Networks to demonstrate better precision of the proposed technique.

- Provides a step-by-step workflow to set up and train the neural network to solve the Schrodinger equation.

- Simulates the full solution methodology in Simulink to easily replicate results and showcase the technique's application.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and practical contributions in accurately solving the multidimensional Schrodinger equation by combining neural networks with spectral methods using Hermite functions. The simulation further eases adoption.
