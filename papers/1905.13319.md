## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Math word problems require extracting salient information from narratives and transforming them into precise executable meaning representations. This is challenging even for humans as it requires both high precision and significant world knowledge. 
- Current math word problem datasets are either small-scale or do not have precise operational annotations over diverse problem types. This is mainly due to the difficulty of annotation even for human experts.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces a new representation language to model precise operation programs corresponding to math word problems. This aims to improve both model performance and interpretability.
- Presents MathQA, a large-scale dataset of 37K English math word problems annotated with operation programs using the proposed representation language.
- Introduces a neural sequence-to-program model with automatic problem categorization that maps word problems to operation programs.

Key Contributions:
- New representation language that covers diverse math problem types and facilitates annotation and interpretability
- MathQA dataset with 37K problems densely annotated with operation programs using crowdsourcing 
- Neural sequence-to-program model enhanced with categorization that outperforms competitive baselines on MathQA and prior state-of-the-art on AQuA dataset
- Analysis showing remaining gap to human performance indicating MathQA poses new challenges for future research

In summary, the paper introduces a new representation language, large-scale annotated dataset, and neural sequence-to-program model to address challenges in math word problem solving related to interpretability, annotation, and performance over diverse problem types. Key results demonstrate the utility of their proposed solutions while highlighting remaining challenges towards human-level competence.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new representation language for modeling operation programs corresponding to math word problems. What are the key advantages of using this representation language over previous approaches like mapping problems directly to equations?

2. The representation language consists of 58 different operations. What considerations went into deciding on this set of operations in order to balance coverage of problem types while maintaining interpretability? 

3. The paper describes a dynamic annotation platform used for crowd-sourcing operation program alignments. What are some of the key features of this platform that enabled collection of high-quality annotations from non-expert crowd workers?

4. What role does the category-based hierarchy structure play in the overall method? How is the categorization strategy used to improve model performance while preserving interpretability?

5. The sequence-to-program neural model incorporates informed decoding by predicting operations and arguments separately. Why is this separation important? Does it improve overall model performance?

6. What modifications were made to the attention-based seq2seq model architecture to integrate the automatic problem categorization? How does categorization function as a "hard switch" in the model?

7. When executing decoded operation programs to find a matching solution from the multiple choice options, what strategies are used to handle variation in the executed numerical values?

8. What are some of the major limitations of the current representation language and categorization strategy based on the error analysis? How could the language and strategy be extended?

9. Does incorporating intermediate operation programs as an extra layer of supervision help reduce unwanted biases that can be present in large-scale math word problem datasets? What evidence supports this?

10. What types of currently unsolvable math word problems are discussed as potential areas where the representation language and models could be extended, such as sequence problems? What would this extension entail?
