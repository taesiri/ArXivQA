# [MathQA: Towards Interpretable Math Word Problem Solving with   Operation-Based Formalisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Math word problems require extracting salient information from narratives and transforming them into precise executable meaning representations. This is challenging even for humans as it requires both high precision and significant world knowledge. 
- Current math word problem datasets are either small-scale or do not have precise operational annotations over diverse problem types. This is mainly due to the difficulty of annotation even for human experts.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces a new representation language to model precise operation programs corresponding to math word problems. This aims to improve both model performance and interpretability.
- Presents MathQA, a large-scale dataset of 37K English math word problems annotated with operation programs using the proposed representation language.
- Introduces a neural sequence-to-program model with automatic problem categorization that maps word problems to operation programs.

Key Contributions:
- New representation language that covers diverse math problem types and facilitates annotation and interpretability
- MathQA dataset with 37K problems densely annotated with operation programs using crowdsourcing 
- Neural sequence-to-program model enhanced with categorization that outperforms competitive baselines on MathQA and prior state-of-the-art on AQuA dataset
- Analysis showing remaining gap to human performance indicating MathQA poses new challenges for future research

In summary, the paper introduces a new representation language, large-scale annotated dataset, and neural sequence-to-program model to address challenges in math word problem solving related to interpretability, annotation, and performance over diverse problem types. Key results demonstrate the utility of their proposed solutions while highlighting remaining challenges towards human-level competence.
