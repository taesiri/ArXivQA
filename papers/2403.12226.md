# [Large-scale flood modeling and forecasting with FloodCast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing large-scale flood forecasting systems face challenges in accurately simulating flooding processes due to reliance on fixed model parameters/grids and high computational costs. This limits their ability to provide timely flood warnings. Additionally, many flood forecasting systems lack sufficient real-world measurement data for model initialization and calibration, especially in data-scarce regions, leading to equifinality issues.

Proposed Solution - FloodCast Framework:
The paper proposes FloodCast, an integrated flood modeling and forecasting framework combining multi-satellite observations and an innovative geometry-adaptive physics-informed neural solver (GeoPINS).

Multi-Satellite Observation Module:
- Real-time unsupervised change detection (UCD) technique to rapidly map flood extents over time using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Validated on 2022 Pakistan floods.  
- Rainfall processing and analysis tool to obtain real-time high resolution precipitation data to drive flood simulations.
- Estimate model parameters like initial flood depths from SAR and terrain data.
- Calibrate and validate hydrodynamic model predictions.

Hydrodynamic Modeling Module: 
- Propose GeoPINS that combines strengths of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (resolution invariant, no training data need).
- Reformulate PINNs loss in geometry-adaptive space to enable solving PDEs on irregular domains. Employ FFT pseudo-spectral methods for gradients.
- GeoPINS demonstrates excellent accuracy in solving PDEs on regular and irregular domains.
- Propose sequence-to-sequence model building on GeoPINS to handle long time series and large spatial scales needed for flood modeling. Employs sequence-to-sequence learning and boundary condition encoding.

Evaluation and Results:
- Establish flood simulation benchmark dataset for 2022 Pakistan floods using finite difference solution of shallow water equations.
- Validate FloodCast on inundation range, depth and spatiotemporal downscaling using SAR, benchmark and optical satellite data. 
- Hydrodynamics and sequence-to-sequence GeoPINS align well, especially for high water levels. 
- Sequence-to-sequence GeoPINS displays better accuracy than hydrodynamics when validated against SAR-based depths.
- Effectiveness in large-scale high resolution flood dynamics demonstrated.

Main Contributions:
- FloodCast framework integrating satellite observations and GeoPINS hydrodynamic model for large-scale flood modeling and forecasting
- Real-time multi-satellite processing tools for model inputs and validation
- Innovative geometry-adaptive physics-informed neural solver (GeoPINS)  
- Sequence-to-sequence model enabling GeoPINS to handle extensive spatiotemporal scales
- Thorough evaluation on 2022 Pakistan floods, demonstrating accurate high-resolution flood dynamics solutions

The proposed FloodCast framework and models pave the way for real-time, robust flood forecasting even in data-scarce regions while addressing scalability limitations of traditional hydrodynamic approaches.
