# [DiscoBAX: Discovery of Optimal Intervention Sets in Genomic Experiment   Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04064)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes DiscoBAX, a new Bayesian algorithm execution method for optimal experimental design in genomics. The goal is to efficiently select a diverse set of gene perturbations that maximally impact a disease phenotype. This is formalized as selecting perturbation sets that maximize both the expected phenotype change and diversity of mechanisms probed. DiscoBAX combines an approximate subset selection algorithm for finding high-value, diverse sets with an active learning acquisition function that maximizes information gain about this subset over iterations. Experiments on synthetic data show DiscoBAX identifies global optima faster than baselines. Experiments on real-world genomics datasets demonstrate superior performance on maximizing discovery of top interventions and cluster diversity compared to prior methods like Bayesian optimization, bandits, and active learning. The method is also relatively robust to hyperparameter choices. Overall, DiscoBAX advances state-of-the-art experimental design in genomics for effective, sample-efficient exploration of high-dimensional biological intervention spaces.
