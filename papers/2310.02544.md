# [SlowFormer: Universal Adversarial Patch for Attack on Compute and Energy
  Efficiency of Inference Efficient Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02544)

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a universal adversarial patch attack called SlowFormer to increase the compute and power usage of input-dependent efficient vision transformers. What are some key advantages and limitations of using a universal patch attack compared to other input-dependent adversarial attacks like perturbations? 

2. The threat model assumes the attacker only has access to the victim's trained model and can modify its input. What are some ways the attack could be made more practical, for example by relaxing these assumptions? How would this affect the difficulty of defense?

3. The SlowFormer attack is evaluated on three different efficient transformer methods (A-ViT, ATS, AdaViT). What are some key differences between these methods that make the attack success vary? How could the attack be adapted to more effectively target each method?

4. The paper shows the attack can increase FLOPs to the maximum level possible in some settings. However, how well does this correlate with actual increases in power consumption, latency, and other metrics? What experiments could be done to better evaluate the real-world impact?

5. For the adversarial training defense, how sensitive is the method to hyperparameters like number of adversarial patches maintained, patch optimization iterations, etc? Could ensemble or multi-step adversarial training provide better robustness? 

6. The paper suggests efficient adaptive methods will become more popular as non-adaptive techniques reach effectiveness limits. Do you agree with this view? What other techniques besides input-adaptive could advance efficiency?

7. The attack uses a simple loss formulation based on the existing losses of the efficient models. How might more complex loss functions further improve attack success? Could adversarial losses be incorporated?

8. How well would the attack transfer between different model architectures, input modalities (e.g. video), and tasks? What adaptations would be needed?

9. For practical systems, what other defenses beyond adversarial training could mitigate these attacks? For example, could token pruning heuristics be made more robust?

10. How might similar attacks apply to other areas such as NLP models? Could techniques like conditional computation also be vulnerable? What changes would be needed?


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- Can efficient vision transformer models that adaptively reduce computation/FLOPs based on the input image be vulnerable to a universal adversarial patch attack? 

- The authors hypothesize that such efficient transformer models can be attacked by optimizing a universal patch on the training data that when applied to any image, will force the model to use maximum computation/FLOPs during inference.

- They test this hypothesis by attacking three different efficient transformer methods - A-ViT, ATS, and AdaViT. The goal is to increase the model FLOPs and compute to the maximum possible amount using a small universal patch.

- The paper also explores whether adversarial training can be used as a potential defense against such attacks. The hypothesis is that training the model to be robust to universal adversarial patches may reduce the attack's effectiveness in increasing compute/FLOPs.

In summary, the key research questions are around the vulnerability of efficient vision transformers to universal patch attacks that force maximum computation, and whether adversarial training can mitigate this. The experiments and results aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Showing that efficient vision transformer methods that adaptively reduce computation based on input are vulnerable to a universal adversarial patch attack. The attack can increase the compute and power usage.

2. Demonstrating the attack on three different efficient transformer methods - A-ViT, ATS, and AdaViT. In some cases, the attack can increase the computation to the maximum possible level.

3. Proposing a simple adversarial training based defense method that can reduce the attack success to some extent.

4. Highlighting the need for more research into robustness and defense methods for efficient vision transformers, especially input-adaptive ones that will be crucial for future mobile and embedded applications. 

The key idea is that input-adaptive methods that change compute based on input can be tricked by an adversarial patch to always use the maximum compute, thus increasing power usage. This is shown through comprehensive experiments on ImageNet with three recent methods. The paper makes an important contribution in highlighting this vulnerability, providing strong attack results, and proposing an initial defense. It encourages more future work on adversarial robustness for efficient vision transformers.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SlowFormer, a universal adversarial patch attack that increases computation and power consumption of efficient vision transformer models by optimizing a patch to undo token pruning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of adversarial attacks on efficient vision transformers:

- This paper focuses specifically on adversarial patch attacks that target the computational efficiency of vision transformer models. Most prior work on adversarial attacks targets model accuracy rather than efficiency. The authors make a case for why attacks targeting efficiency are an important vulnerability to study.

- The attack is designed to be universal - a single patch optimized on the training set can reduce efficiency across the test set. This makes the attack more practical compared to image-specific perturbations. Prior work like ILFO and DeepSloth use image-specific perturbations.

- The attack is demonstrated on multiple recent efficient transformer architectures including A-ViT, ATS, and AdaViT. Showing the vulnerability holds across different approaches strengthens the paper. 

- In contrast to some prior work that focuses on CNNs, this paper targets the emerging transformer models for vision. As transformers become more popular, it is useful to study their robustness.

- They design a defense based on adversarial training and show it reduces attack success. But there is still room for improvement.

- Compared to prior work on energy attacks like ILFO and DeepSloth that achieve high attack success, the success rates here are more modest. But those papers attacked weaker dynamic networks compared to the recent efficient transformers.

Overall, I think this paper makes a nice contribution in studying adversarial robustness of efficient vision transformers. The universal patch attack threat model is practical and likely to generalize. Testing across multiple transformer architectures is a plus. There is certainly more work to be done in developing stronger attacks and better defenses, but this is a good start on an important problem.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Developing better defense methods against the SlowFormer attack. They propose a simple adversarial training defense, but it is not very effective at reducing the attack success rate. More advanced defense methods need to be explored.

- Studying the robustness of other efficient vision transformer methods to the SlowFormer attack or variations of it. The authors only evaluated 3 methods, so it's important to analyze if other approaches have similar vulnerabilities.

- Exploring other possible goals for the attack besides just increasing compute/FLOPs. For example, one could try to increase memory usage or latency. Or combine multiple objectives into one attack.

- Evaluating adaptive efficient vision transformers on real hardware to measure the actual change in power consumption under the SlowFormer attack. The authors currently just report change in FLOPs which may not perfectly correlate with power usage.

- Designing adaptive methods that take into account possible attacks like SlowFormer during training. This could inspire new techniques that are inherently more robust to such adversarial patches.

- Considering other threat models like a patch that changes per input image rather than being universal. Or allowing the patch location to vary across images.

- Expanding beyond vision transformers to other modalities like efficient speech or language models.

So in summary, further work on defenses, analyzing other efficient methods, exploring new attack objectives, hardware measurements, building robustness into models, and applying similar ideas to other modalities are suggested as interesting future directions by the authors. The problem of vulnerabilities in efficient deep learning systems seems far from solved.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a "SlowFormer" attack to reduce the energy efficiency of input-adaptive vision transformer models. They attack three recent efficient transformers (A-ViT, ATS, AdaViT) that adaptively reduce computation based on the input image. The attack uses a universal adversarial patch optimized to increase the computation (FLOPs) of the model. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 show the attack can recover nearly all of the computation reduced by the efficient methods simply by pasting a small patch on images. For example, on A-ViT the FLOPs are increased from 0.87 to 1.3 GFLOPs out of a maximum possible 1.3 GFLOPs. They also propose a defense using adversarial training that can mitigate the attack's effectiveness to some extent. Overall, the paper demonstrates a vulnerability of adaptive efficient transformers to adversarial patches that increase compute and power usage, and encourages more work on analyzing and defending against such attacks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an adversarial attack called SlowFormer that targets the computational efficiency of vision transformers. Recently, methods have been proposed to reduce the computation of transformers at inference time based on the input image. For example, by dropping unimportant tokens for simple images. The authors show that such input-dependent efficient transformers are vulnerable to an attack that uses a universal adversarial patch. By optimizing this patch on the training data, at test time simply pasting it on any image can increase the computation of the model back to the original baseline (non-efficient version). 

The authors experiment with attacking three recent efficient transformer methods including A-ViT, ATS, and AdaViT. They are able to increase the FLOPs in some cases all the way to the original non-efficient baseline, achieving 100% attack success. They also propose a defense using adversarial training that reduces the attack success. The authors argue that adaptive efficient transformers will be necessary for applications like mobile devices. They hope the paper will encourage more future work on analyzing vulnerabilities of efficient deep learning and developing defenses.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes an adversarial patch attack called SlowFormer to increase the computation and power usage of efficient vision transformer models. The attack targets three different efficient transformer methods (A-VIT, ATS, Ada-VIT) that adaptively reduce computation based on the input image. The attack optimizes a small universal patch on the training data that when applied to any input image, can increase the model FLOPs back to the maximum level. The loss used to optimize the patch depends on the specific method, for example maximizing token retention for A-VIT or making attention weights uniform for ATS. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 show the attack can successfully increase model FLOPs in all three methods using a reasonably small patch occupying only 2-8% of the image area. The attack highlights vulnerabilities in current efficient transformers and the need for better defense methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the vulnerability of efficient vision transformer models to adversarial attacks. Specifically, the authors focus on adaptive efficient vision transformers whose computation varies based on the input. They show that such models are susceptible to a universal adversarial patch attack that can increase the models' compute and power usage during inference. The key question the paper aims to answer is: can an attacker trick adaptive efficient vision transformers into using maximum compute/power by just pasting a small patch on the input image?

The key contributions and findings are:

- They propose "SlowFormer", a universal adversarial patch attack that can increase the compute and power usage of adaptive efficient vision transformers. 

- They demonstrate the attack on three state-of-the-art efficient transformer methods - A-ViT, ATS, and AdaViT. The attack is able to recover close to 100% of the computation savings achieved by these methods in some cases, just by pasting a small 64x64 pixel patch.

- They analyze the attack under different conditions like patch size, location etc. The attack works even with very small patches occupying <2% of image area.

- They propose a simple defense method based on adversarial training that can reduce the attack success to some extent. But there is scope for improvement.

In summary, the key issue addressed is the vulnerability of adaptive efficient vision transformers to adversarial attacks on their efficiency. The paper provides the first demonstration of such an attack and highlights the need to improve the robustness of these models.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores a potential vulnerability in adaptive computation efficient vision transformer models like A-ViT, AdaVit, and ATS. The authors show that these models, which dynamically reduce computation based on input complexity, are susceptible to a universal adversarial patch attack. By optimizing a small patch to maximize compute and attaching it to any input image, the adversary can force the victim model to use maximum compute for all samples. Experiments demonstrate that a 64x64 patch occupying just 8% of image area can often recover close to 100% of the computation originally reduced by the efficient model. The attack succeeds in increasing power usage, which could be detrimental for real-world deployment of these models in mobile or embedded devices. Though a basic adversarial training technique can slightly reduce attack success, better defenses are still needed. Overall, this paper highlights an important vulnerability in adaptive vision transformers that the community should further study and address with robust training procedures.
