# [Using Causal Trees to Estimate Personalized Task Difficulty in   Post-Stroke Individuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04109)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Adapting training programs to an individual's ability level is crucial for post-stroke recovery. However, quantifying task difficulty for a specific individual at their current recovery stage remains challenging. Existing approaches either focus on difficulty of isolated movements or require robots to physically assist people through entire tasks.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a method to automatically generate regions of different task difficulty levels based on an individual's performance on features of the task. They formulate the problem as estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using causal trees. The causal tree jointly learns regions that group tasks with similar difficulty levels for an individual compared to a neurotypical group.  

Contributions:
- Formulates personalized task difficulty estimation as a problem of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation using causal trees.
- Compares causal tree approach against several ML baselines on a dataset of post-stroke participants performing a reaching task, showing significantly better prediction of actual task performance.
- Shows interpretable regions of task difficulty levels, which indicate to clinicians and users what tasks need more practice.
- Approach is user-agnostic, does not require physical assistance by robot, and can extend to other tasks like pushing or grasping.

In summary, the key idea is to use causal trees to estimate personalized effects of task parameters on performance relative to a baseline, in order to automatically generate interpretable regions of difficulty levels for adapting robotic training programs to individuals' ability.
