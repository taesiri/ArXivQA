# [Adapting to Teammates in a Cooperative Language Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00823)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Codenames is a popular cooperative word game involving two teams, where successful coordination and language understanding between teammates is crucial for good performance. 
- Existing AI agents for playing Codenames utilize a single static language model internally. This often leads to good performance with some teammates and inferior performance with others, as the agent cannot adapt its language model to be compatible with any specific teammate.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper presents the first adaptive agent for playing Codenames. It adopts an ensemble approach with the goal of determining, during gameplay with a specific teammate, which of its internal expert agents (each potentially with its own language model) is the best match for that teammate.

- They propose a novel single metric called the "Codenames Linear Team" (CoLT) rating to evaluate the overall performance of a Codenames team, whether playing solitaire or competitively. This metric is optimized by the adaptive ensemble agent.

- The ensemble agent uses the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) multi-armed bandit algorithm to select one of its internal experts to use on each turn. Feedback in terms of the CoLT rating for each expert's actions is used by UCB to determine expert selection.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of the first adaptive agent for Codenames that improves its teammate compatibility over time without any prior knowledge about teammates.

- Introduction of the CoLT rating - a novel single metric for evaluating Codenames teams that captures the inherent tradeoffs, allowing for an optimization objective and direct comparison between teams.

- Demonstration through simulation that the ensemble approach adapts to individual teammates, selecting different internal experts for different teammates. Performance is often nearly as good as the best expert partnered with that teammate.

- This represents an important step towards adaptable language-based agents for cooperative settings that can maximize performance regardless of teammate identity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an adaptive ensemble agent for the cooperative word game Codenames that uses a novel rating metric and multi-armed bandit algorithm to select the best internal expert agent to maximize coordination with an unknown teammate over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The Adaptive Codenames Ensemble (ACE) agent, which is the first adaptive agent framework for the game of Codenames. The ACE agent uses an ensemble approach, selecting between a set of internal "expert" agents during gameplay in order to maximize compatibility and performance with the current teammate.

2) The Codenames Linear Team (CoLT) rating function, a novel single metric for evaluating the performance of Codenames teams. The CoLT function is trained to correlate with win percentage in competitive play and provides a way to compare teams that is more definitive than using win rate and win time. The ACE agent uses the CoLT function to track the success of each expert agent.

In summary, the key innovations presented are an adaptive ensemble agent for Codenames that tries to maximize a novel CoLT rating function in order to select the best internal expert to use with the current teammate. This allows the agent to adapt its language use and clue/guessing strategy to improve coordination and performance with any unknown teammate.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new metric called the Codenames Linear Team (\colt) rating to evaluate the performance of Codenames teams. How is this metric derived and what are the advantages of using this single metric over the previous metrics of win rate and win time?

2. The Adaptive Codenames Ensemble (\ace) agent utilizes the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) bandit algorithm to select which internal expert to use on each turn. Why was UCB chosen over other bandit algorithms like Exp4? What modifications were made to the standard UCB algorithm for the \ace agent?

3. The paper demonstrates that the \colt metric leads to good performance in terms of win rate and win time when optimized directly. What is the justification for using simulated data to train the \colt model initially? How sensitive do you think the model weights are to the training data used?

4. In the without partner experiments, the \ace agent as guesser performed close to the best average agent, while as spymaster it outperformed the best average agent. Why do you think there is this difference in relative performance based on the role?

5. How many games does it take in practice, based on the results in Table 5, for the \ace agent to adapt to a teammate when a good partner is present versus when no good partner is available? What explains this difference in adaptation time?

6. The set of base agents used as experts utilize the same basic framework but differ in their word embeddings. What motivated the choice of word embeddings included? What potential issues could arise from having multiple related experts (like the GloVe agents) in the ensemble?

7. The adaptive approach relies entirely on the bandit algorithm and \colt metric to determine teammate compatibility. Do you think any other signals or heuristics could be incorporated to improve expert selection? What might those be?

8. If the \ace agent were to be applied with human teammates, what differences would you expect in the agent's ability to adapt over time compared to the fully AI results? Would any changes need to be made to enable human play?

9. The paper mentions ensemble construction as an area of future work. What approaches from ensemble learning could be utilized to try to create a better ensemble from a pool of experts? What metrics could be used to evaluate ensemble quality?

10. How do you think the adaptive ensemble approach could be applied to other cooperative language games besides Codenames? What elements are most critical for the approach to work effectively?
