# [Adapting to Teammates in a Cooperative Language Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00823)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Codenames is a popular cooperative word game involving two teams, where successful coordination and language understanding between teammates is crucial for good performance. 
- Existing AI agents for playing Codenames utilize a single static language model internally. This often leads to good performance with some teammates and inferior performance with others, as the agent cannot adapt its language model to be compatible with any specific teammate.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper presents the first adaptive agent for playing Codenames. It adopts an ensemble approach with the goal of determining, during gameplay with a specific teammate, which of its internal expert agents (each potentially with its own language model) is the best match for that teammate.

- They propose a novel single metric called the "Codenames Linear Team" (CoLT) rating to evaluate the overall performance of a Codenames team, whether playing solitaire or competitively. This metric is optimized by the adaptive ensemble agent.

- The ensemble agent uses the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) multi-armed bandit algorithm to select one of its internal experts to use on each turn. Feedback in terms of the CoLT rating for each expert's actions is used by UCB to determine expert selection.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of the first adaptive agent for Codenames that improves its teammate compatibility over time without any prior knowledge about teammates.

- Introduction of the CoLT rating - a novel single metric for evaluating Codenames teams that captures the inherent tradeoffs, allowing for an optimization objective and direct comparison between teams.

- Demonstration through simulation that the ensemble approach adapts to individual teammates, selecting different internal experts for different teammates. Performance is often nearly as good as the best expert partnered with that teammate.

- This represents an important step towards adaptable language-based agents for cooperative settings that can maximize performance regardless of teammate identity.
