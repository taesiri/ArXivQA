# [Inverse-Free Fast Natural Gradient Descent Method for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03473)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Second-order optimization methods like natural gradient descent (NGD) can converge faster than first-order methods like SGD by incorporating curvature information of the loss landscape. However, computing the inverse of the Fisher information matrix is computationally expensive for deep neural networks, making these methods impractical. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a fast natural gradient descent (FNGD) method that only requires computing the inverse during the first epoch. It reformulates the preconditioning formula in NGD as a weighted sum of per-sample gradients using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) formula. The weights depend only on the sample correlation matrix which is assumed to be constant across epochs. By sharing the weights across epochs, FNGD approximates NGD preconditioning as a fixed-weight sum akin to SGD.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes connection between NGD and SGD by reformulating NGD preconditioning as weighted per-sample gradient sum using SMW formula
- Reduces preconditioning complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) by rearranging computation order 
- Proposes weight sharing technique across epochs based on assumption of constant sample correlation  
- Achieves 2.05x speedup over KFAC with comparable performance on CIFAR classification
- Outperforms AdamW on machine translation while requiring almost equal training time

In summary, the paper makes NGD computationally efficient by approximating it as a fixed-weight per-sample gradient sum with shared weights across epochs. This reduces the complexity and eliminates the need to compute inverses after the first epoch. Experiments show superior efficiency over state-of-the-art second-order methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a fast natural gradient descent method that approximates the preconditioning step as a fixed-coefficient weighted sum of per-sample gradients, allowing it to achieve comparable efficiency to first-order methods while retaining the faster convergence of second-order methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a fast natural gradient descent (FNGD) method that reduces the computational complexity of natural gradient descent to be comparable to first-order methods like SGD. Specifically:

1) It reformulates the preconditioning formula in natural gradient descent as a weighted sum of per-sample gradients using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. This establishes a connection between natural gradient and SGD.

2) It shares the weighted coefficients across epochs since they only depend on the sample correlation matrix, avoiding the need to compute the inverse in each iteration. This reduces the complexity to be similar to SGD. 

3) It efficiently computes the per-sample gradients by using autograd on module outputs rather than parameters, eliminating redundant average gradient computations.

4) Experiments show FNGD can achieve comparable performance to methods like KFAC and Shampoo on image classification and machine translation, while being up to 2.05x and 5.7x faster per epoch, respectively. Its time complexity can approach that of SGD.

In summary, the key innovation is approximating the preconditioning step in natural gradient descent as a fixed-coefficient weighted sum across epochs, enabling major computational savings while maintaining accuracy.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the fast natural gradient descent (FNGD) method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper reformulates the natural gradient descent (NGD) update rule using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) formula. Can you explain the details of this reformulation and how it leads to interpreting the preconditioned gradient as a weighted sum of per-sample gradients? 

2. The weighted coefficients for the per-sample gradients depend solely on the sample correlation matrix U^TU. What is the intuition behind sharing these coefficients across training epochs? What assumptions does this sharing make about the training data?

3. The paper claims computational complexity is reduced from O(N_lM^2+N_l^2M+N_l^2) to O(M^2+N_lM) by rearranging the multiplication order. Can you walk through the mathematical details of this claim?

4. When computing per-sample gradients, the paper uses autograd on module outputs rather than parameters. How does this eliminate redundant computations? What are the memory and computational tradeoffs?

5. The damping parameter 位 balances numerical stability and approximation accuracy. Explain the proportionality relation proposed to set 位 based on the Frobenius norm of U^TU. 

6. How does the technique of incorporating 1/位 into the learning rate simplify hyperparameter tuning? What is the justification for setting 位 such that the coefficient vector approximates 1/M?

7. The relative time cost of FNGD compared to SGD is higher for deeper ResNet models than shallower ones. What causes this discrepancy and how can it be optimized?

8. For Transformer models, why is there no need for the costly patch extraction operation required in CNNs? How does this impact relative time costs?

9. The paper demonstrates significant speedups compared to KFAC and Shampoo but more modest gains over Eva. What are the algorithmic differences that account for these relative performance improvements?

10. How suitable is the proposed FNGD method for large-scale distributed training? What communication costs are incurred and how do they compare to other second-order methods?
