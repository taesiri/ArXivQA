# [Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to enable transformers to effectively model and synthesize high-resolution images. 

The key challenges are that transformers are computationally infeasible for long input sequences like images with millions of pixels, and they lack the inductive biases of CNNs that exploit local spatial correlations in images. 

The central hypothesis is that combining the effectiveness of CNN inductive biases with the expressivity of transformers will allow transformers to efficiently model global compositions of visual elements in images while relying on the CNN to capture local structure. Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) Using a convolutional VQGAN model to learn a discrete codebook of perceptual image parts. This provides a compressed representation of images that transformers can feasibly process.

2) Applying a transformer architecture to model long-range dependencies between the image parts by autoregressively predicting their composition. 

3) Adopting a sliding window approach at sampling time to generate high-resolution images.

The key insight is to leverage the complementary strengths of CNNs and transformers - exploiting CNN inductive biases to obtain context-rich image representations that enable efficient high-resolution image modeling with transformers. The experiments aim to validate whether this approach can enable transformers to effectively synthesize diverse high-resolution images.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that combining CNNs and transformers in this way will allow transformers to model global image structure and generate high-fidelity, consistent megapixel images. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability across a variety of image synthesis tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a method that enables transformers to synthesize high-resolution images efficiently. The key ideas are:

- Using a convolutional VQGAN model to learn a discrete codebook of rich visual elements. This allows compressing images into much shorter sequences of codebook indices compared to raw pixels.

- Modeling the global composition of these visual elements with a transformer architecture. By operating on the codebook indices rather than pixels, the transformer can capture long-range dependencies for high-resolution image generation. 

- Applying the transformer autoregressively in a sliding window fashion to generate arbitrary-sized images. The VQGAN provides enough context in each window for coherent global image synthesis.

- Showing this framework can be adapted to various conditional and unconditional image synthesis tasks like semantic image synthesis, pose-guided person image generation, super-resolution, etc.

In summary, the paper demonstrates how combining the efficiency of convolutional networks for local modeling and the expressivity of transformers for global modeling enables transformer-based high-resolution image generation. The key innovation is using a VQGAN to compress images into semantic codebook elements that transformers can feasibly model.
