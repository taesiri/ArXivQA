# [Multi-criteria approach for selecting an explanation from the set of   counterfactuals produced by an ensemble of explainers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13940)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Counterfactual explanations provide information about how to change feature values of an instance to obtain a desired prediction from a machine learning model. 
- There are many methods to generate counterfactuals but they optimize different, sometimes conflicting objectives like proximity, sparsity, actionability etc. Choosing the most appropriate method and explanation is challenging.
- Existing methods mostly optimize one or two objectives, defined by a weighted loss function. Manually tuning the weights is difficult. 
- Methods that generate multiple counterfactuals leave the selection to the user, causing choice overload.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a multi-stage ensemble approach that combines different counterfactual generation methods and uses multi-criteria decision analysis to select a single, preferred counterfactual.
- Stage 1: Generate counterfactuals using an ensemble of diverse base explanation methods 
- Stage 2: Filter out invalid and non-actionable counterfactuals
- Stage 3: Use dominance relation to reduce set of counterfactuals to a Pareto front subset that is not worse on any one criterion 
- Stage 4: Select counterfactual closest to Ideal Point using Manhattan distance in criteria space

Main Contributions:
- Integration of an ensemble of base explainers with multi-criteria analysis to select a compromise counterfactual based on multiple quality measures
- Experiments show the approach provides good tradeoffs between proximity, feasibility and discriminative power
- Analysis reveals no single method dominates on all criteria, justifying the ensemble approach
- Proposed method performs competitively on individual criteria and best overall across criteria
- Simulations of user preference functions show proposed method provides good tradeoffs for majority of possible criterion weights
