## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Roll With the Punches: Expansion and Shrinkage of Soft Label Selection for Semi-supervised Fine-Grained Learning":

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of semi-supervised learning (SSL) for fine-grained visual classification (SS-FGVC). In SS-FGVC, the unlabeled data is very difficult to distinguish even for humans, such as two similar species of birds. This poses major challenges for prevailing pseudo-labeling based SSL methods, as the inaccurate pseudo-labels on fine-grained unlabeled data can severely mislead the model training. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a framework called "SoC" for soft pseudo-label selection in SS-FGVC. The key ideas are:

1) Coupled Optimization Goal: Encourage the pseudo-label to (i) contain the ground-truth class (Expansion Objective); (ii) contain as few classes as possible (Shrinkage Objective).

2) Expansion: Use a k-medoids clustering algorithm on the classes based on a novel "Class Transition Tracking" technique to measure class similarity. This expands the pseudo-label to absorb more potential ground-truth classes.  

3) Shrinkage: Shrink the selected classes in the pseudo-label based on the prediction confidence. High confidence corresponds to fewer selected classes to filter out more noise. This is proved to connect to entropy minimization.

Main Contributions:
1) Propose a coupled optimization goal tailored for SS-FGVC which relaxes the requirement of accurate pseudo-labels.

2) Design a Class Transition Tracking technique to quantify inter-class similarity for clustering on class space.

3) Establish a confidence-aware scheme to control the soft label selection range based on empirical confidence.

4) Experiments show consistent and significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on SS-FGVC datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed SoC framework.
