# [AV4EV: Open-Source Modular Autonomous Electric Vehicle Platform to Make   Mobility Research Accessible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00951)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There is a gap between full-scale autonomous vehicles used in industry, which are expensive and require large specialized teams, versus small-scale RC cars used in academia, which have limited dynamics and capabilities. This makes it difficult for academic researchers to develop and validate advanced autonomous driving algorithms. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors design and build an open-source one-third scale autonomous electric go-kart platform to bridge this gap. The platform is modular, versatile, high-performance and cost-effective, enabling accessibility while retaining key autonomous driving capabilities.

Key Contributions:

1. Mechatronics Design: Modular mechatronic subsystems support manual, autonomous and teleoperation driving modes. This includes throttle, steering, braking and power distribution systems.

2. Sensing Suite: Flexible configuration of sensors like LiDAR, camera, IMU and GPS to facilitate development of perception and localization algorithms.

3. Software: Implemented GPS-based pure pursuit control and camera-based follow-the-gap algorithm with localization and raceline optimization. Integrated with Autoware for portability.

4. Resources: Comprehensive open-source materials provided including hardware design, software, tutorial videos and bill of materials to replicate the platform.

In summary, the paper presents an open, modular one-third scale autonomous go-kart platform with supportive systems to make autonomous driving research more accessible. Detailed experimentation demonstrates the capabilities, and all resources are made publicly available to stimulate collaboration.
