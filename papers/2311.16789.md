## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this survey paper:

1. This paper categorizes the evolution of language model-based dialogue systems into four stages. Can you elaborate on the key breakthroughs in language models that marked the transition between these stages? How did those breakthroughs impact the development of dialogue systems?

2. The paper discusses semantic perception and semantic reasoning as two key capabilities for comprehending the internal status of a dialogue context. What are some examples of linguistic cues that can reveal user emotions, personality traits or psychological characteristics? How can systems leverage these to generate more personalized and helpful responses?  

3. How does the paper define task-oriented vs open domain dialogue systems? What are some of the key differences in how they interact with external knowledge sources like databases or knowledge graphs during response generation?

4. The survey discusses the increasing fusion between task-oriented and open-domain systems, as well as between dialogue systems and language models. What are some examples of recent works that combine multiple dialogue types or knowledge sources? What challenges still remain in achieving seamless integration?

5. What novel prompting methods does the paper introduce for eliciting an LLM's reasoning capabilities? How do these methods work to extract useful information from dialogue contexts?
