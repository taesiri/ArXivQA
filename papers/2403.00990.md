# [Formulation Comparison for Timeline Construction using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00990)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Timeline construction from text requires identifying the chronological order of events, which is challenging as events are often not described sequentially.  
- Prior approaches have limitations: time anchoring methods fail when events anchor to the same time range; pairwise ordering methods are expensive to annotate all pairs.
- There lacks a unified framework to compare models and task formulations for timeline construction.

Proposed Solution:
- Develops TimeSET, a new timeline construction benchmark, featuring saliency-based event selection and partial ordering to enable practical annotation.

- Proposes an evaluation framework that casts TimeSET into 4 formulations (NLI, Pairwise, MRC, Timeline) to prompt LLMs, enabling cross-model and cross-formulation comparisons.  

- Benchmarks LLMs on existing event ordering datasets to gain robust insights into their capabilities.

Key Findings:
- NLI formulation with Flan-T5 shows strongest performance on TimeSET among others, while more compositional formulations perform better on average. Performance varies across models and formulations.

- Timeline construction and event ordering are still challenging for few-shot LLMs, underperforming smaller fine-tuned models. Larger LLMs perform generally better.

Main Contributions:
- New evaluation dataset TimeSET for timeline construction 

- Novel cross-model/formulation evaluation framework 

- Benchmarking of open LLMs' event ordering capabilities

The work provides a testbed and insights to facilitate future research into better timeline construction systems using LLMs.
