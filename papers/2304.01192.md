# [Navigating to Objects Specified by Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01192)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can an embodied agent reliably navigate to a specific object instance depicted in a given image, in both simulated and real-world environments?

The key aspects of this question are:

- Goal-driven navigation: The agent must navigate to a goal specified by an image, not just randomly explore.

- Instance-specific goal: The image depicts a particular object instance that the agent must locate, not just any object of that category. This requires disambiguating between similar instances.

- Reliable performance: The method must achieve effective results consistently, not just in limited cases. 

- Simulated and real-world transfer: The approach should work well both in simulation and when deployed on a real robot.

To summarize, the core problem is enabling an agent to use an image to navigate to a particular object instance, not just a category, and do this reliably in complex real-world environments. The paper proposes and evaluates a modular framework to address this challenge.
