# [Style Vectors for Steering Generative Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01618)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 show remarkable language generation capabilities, but lack control over the style and implicit information in their outputs. This limits their effectiveness for nuanced human-AI interactions. 

- Existing approaches to steer LLM outputs have limitations:
  - Prompt engineering requires manual effort and is often task-specific. 
  - Style transfer only shifts style between existing texts.
  - Fine-tuning on new data is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution: 
- Derive vector representations called "style vectors" that encode stylistic information like sentiment and emotions. These are added to LLM activations during text generation to steer the output style.

- Compare two methods to obtain style vectors:
  1) Training-based: Optimize "steering vectors" that reproduce sentences in a target style from scratch. Average these to get style vectors.
  2) Activation-based: Directly aggregate activations for sentences in a style to get its style vector.

Main Contributions:
- Show that style vectors extracted from LLM activations better encode style information than trained steering vectors. Activation-based approach also more efficient.

- Demonstrate nuanced steering of LLM outputs towards sentiments and emotions by adding different weighted style vectors. Allows smoother control than prompt engineering.

- Analysis across factual and subjective prompts shows steering is more effective for subjective prompts. For factual prompts with little room for variation, style changes are minor.

- Overall, enabling better control over LLM output style significantly advances abilities for adaptive human-AI interaction. Activation engineering offers a promising way forward.
