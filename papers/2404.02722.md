# [On-line conformalized neural networks ensembles for probabilistic   forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is critical for effective participation in liberalized energy markets. Probabilistic EPF (PEPF) is aimed at characterizing the underlying uncertainty, e.g. via prediction intervals, to support risk optimization and trading.
- Recent works have shown that distributional neural network (NN) ensembles outperform PEPF benchmarks. However, they lack required calibration capabilities, failing coverage tests at various prediction horizons. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel PEPF approach by extending NN ensembles with conformal prediction (CP) techniques and online recalibration.
- It employs asymmetric CP formulation for regression to enable flexible compensation of upper/lower prediction bands at each horizon step. This enhances local efficiency beyond marginal CP coverage.
- An adversarial setup with quantile tracking and coverage error integration is used to address limitations in CP under non-exchangeable conditions (e.g. concept drift).
- Both deep quantile regression and parametric distributional NNs are explored to estimate the quantiles for calibration. Quantiles are aggregated via uniform vincentization for sharper bounds. 

Main Contributions:
- The method contributes towards improved calibration and sample efficiency in NN-based PEPF. Experiments on German and Italian day-ahead markets show gains over state-of-the-art like QRA, deep QR and distributional NNs.
- It provides one of the first detailed empirical analyses of integrating flexible CP techniques in PEPF based on modern NN ensembles.
- The online recalibration framework with adversarial coverage control introduces a principled approach to tackle reliability limitations under practical non-stationary conditions.

In summary, the paper makes valuable contributions in enhancing probabilistic forecasting capabilities of NN models for the important task of electricity price prediction under volatility. The proposed techniques help characterize and bound uncertainties more reliably to support trading and risk management.
