# [SEVA: Leveraging sketches to evaluate alignment between human and   machine visual abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Visual abstraction is key to how humans understand the world, enabling creation of external visual representations that convey meaning, from detailed illustrations to simple sketches. 
- Developing computational models with human-like capacities for visual abstraction is an important goal, but progress requires (1) sketch datasets with systematic variation in abstraction level, and (2) protocols to evaluate model alignment with human sketch understanding patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced SEVA, a new sketch dataset containing ~90K human sketches of 128 objects, with 4 levels of abstraction based on drawing time constraints (4s, 8s, 16s, 32s).

- Proposed model evaluation protocol focused on alignment with human sketch recognition behavior using 3 metrics: (1) top-1 classification accuracy (2) entropy of response distribution (3) semantic neighbor preference.  

- Evaluated suite of 17 state-of-the-art vision models on sketch recognition using SEVA, and explored potential of CLIP-based generative model, CLIPasso, on sketch production.

Key Findings:
- More detailed human sketches were less semantically ambiguous, eliciting tighter response distributions from both humans and models.

- Models displayed distinct sketch recognition patterns, with some better aligned to human accuracy, uncertainty and semantic preferences. 

- However, substantial gaps remain between even the best models and human consistency baselines on all metrics.  

- CLIPasso approximated recognizability of human sketches, especially at higher detail levels, but diverged in meaning at higher abstraction.

Main Contributions:
- Released large-scale human sketch dataset with controlled variation in abstraction
- Provided extensive human baseline sketch recognition data 
- Established multi-faceted protocol for benchmarking model alignment to human visual abstraction
- Demonstrated feasibility of this protocol and provided initial findings on state-of-the-art model performance
