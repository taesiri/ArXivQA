# [Edge Computing based Human-Robot Cognitive Fusion: A Medical Case Study   in the Autism Spectrum Disorder Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00776)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional cloud-based healthcare systems lack real-time monitoring, emergency services, comprehensive analysis, and have high latency. Robot-assisted therapy (RAT) for conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also faces challenges in adapting to patients' changing needs and integrating human experts' guidance. 

Solution:
The paper proposes an edge cognitive computing architecture combining human experts and edge intelligent robots to enable seamless remote diagnosis, round-the-clock monitoring, emergency response, and therapy updates for patients like those with ASD.  

The architecture has a cloud layer for data analysis and resource optimization, an edge layer with intelligent robots for data collection, therapy delivery and emergency response, and an IoT layer with medical and ambient sensors. The edge robot executes a RAT scheme based on the analysis of patient cognitive data.

For ASD, the RAT uses four stages of humor development as cognitive models to improve patients' communication and social skills - funny behaviors, pretend play, knock-knock jokes, and sarcastic jokes. These are represented as behavior trees. The robot guides the patient through these stages under guidance from human experts.

Main Contributions:

- Architecture for edge cognitive computing in healthcare integrating human experts, edge robots, cloud servers and IoT devices

- Edge intelligent robot design that can collect and analyze patient data, deliver therapy, and respond to emergencies

- Robot-assisted therapy for ASD patients using cognitive models based on four stages of humor development to improve social and communication skills


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an edge computing architecture integrating human experts and robots to provide remote diagnosis, monitoring, emergency response, and adaptive therapy for patients like those with autism spectrum disorder.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel architecture of edge cognitive computing that integrates human experts and edge intelligent robots to collaborate in the same framework for next generation medical and healthcare systems. This architecture can achieve remote diagnosis, round-the-clock monitoring, emergency warning, therapy updating, etc.

2. Proposing a cognitive robotic model based on cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients using robot-assisted therapy (RAT). This model creates four cognitive models through the robot to help ASD patients gradually boost their cognitive stages and master social and communication skills.

So in summary, the main contributions are:
1) The architecture for an edge cognitive computing system for healthcare involving both human experts and edge intelligent robots. 
2) A cognitive robotic model using RAT based on CBT to help treat ASD patients by improving their social and communication skills.
