# [Towards the Inferrence of Structural Similarity of Combinatorial   Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02720)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework to infer structural similarity between combinatorial fitness landscapes using local optima networks (LONs) and graph data mining techniques. LONs are constructed by sampling local optima and transitions between them using an iterated local search algorithm. Both node-level and graph-level features are extracted from the LONs to characterize the landscapes. The framework conducts statistical, visual, and quantitative analysis of LONs across problem instances of different dimensions within a problem class, and also across different problem classes. Results on number partitioning, maximum satisfiability, and knapsack problems show high similarity between instances of neighboring dimensions. Landscape visualizations and similarity measurements further confirm the existence of structural similarity. Additional experiments demonstrate a correlation between landscape similarity and algorithm performance, indicating that structurally similar landscapes require similar computational cost for a given metaheuristic to solve. Overall, the paper provides both qualitative and quantitative evidence for latent structural similarity in combinatorial fitness landscapes, enabled by representing landscapes as LONs and analyzing them as complex networks. The proposed techniques offer new perspectives on studying and comparing black-box optimization problems.
