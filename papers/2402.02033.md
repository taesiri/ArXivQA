# [Benchmark for CEC 2024 Competition on Multiparty Multiobjective   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on multiparty multiobjective optimization problems (MPMOPs) which involve multiple decision makers with conflicting objectives. These problems are important in applications like UAV path planning but have received limited attention compared to conventional multiobjective optimization.  

- There is a need for tailored modeling approaches and benchmark problems to promote research in this area.

Solution:
- The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite for the CEC 2024 Competition on Multiparty Multiobjective Optimization. 

- The benchmark has two parts: 
   1) 11 problems with common Pareto optimal solutions sourced from literature to allow algorithm assessment. 
   2) 6 new biparty multiobjective UAV path planning (BPMO-UAVPP) problems with unknown optimal solutions.

- The BPMO-UAVPP problems have an efficiency decision maker (objectives: path length, energy use etc.) and safety decision maker (objectives: risk, noise).

Evaluation Criteria:
- Algorithms on the first benchmark are evaluated using the Multiparty Inverted Generational Distance (MPIGD) metric to measure closeness to known Pareto front. 

- Algorithms on the second benchmark with unknown solutions are evaluated using the Multiparty Hypervolume (MPHV) metric.

- The average algorithm ranking across all problems will serve as a performance benchmark.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a comprehensive, two-part benchmark suite to promote research on the important but under-studied area of multiparty multiobjective optimization.

- Includes new biparty UAV path planning problems with conflicting efficiency and safety objectives reflecting real-world complexity.

- Defines evaluation criteria tailored for multiparty problems based on MPIGD and MPHV metrics to serve as algorithm performance benchmark.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a benchmark suite for the CEC 2024 Competition on Multiparty Multiobjective Optimization, comprising 11 problems with common Pareto optimal solutions to assess algorithm performance as well as 6 real-world biparty multiobjective UAV path planning problems with unknown optima, using the multiparty inverted generational distance (MPIGD) and multiparty hypervolume (MPHV) metrics respectively to evaluate algorithms based on their ability to approximate or find Pareto front solutions suited to the different objectives of multiple decision makers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a benchmark suite for the CEC 2024 Competition on Multiparty Multiobjective Optimization. The main contributions are:

1) It introduces two sets of benchmark problems for evaluating algorithms for multiparty multiobjective optimization: 

(a) 11 problems with common Pareto optimal solutions adapted from existing dynamic multiobjective optimization benchmarks. These provide a basis for algorithm assessment.

(b) 6 new biparty multiobjective UAV path planning (BPMO-UAVPP) problems with unknown optimal solutions. These aim to encourage the development of modeling approaches tailored for multiparty scenarios.

2) It defines evaluation criteria, including the multiparty inverted generational distance (MPIGD) metric for the first set of problems and the multiparty hypervolume (MPHV) metric for the second set. The average algorithm ranking across all problems will serve as a performance benchmark.

3) It provides details on problem formulations, constraints, parameters and experimental settings to facilitate a standardized benchmarking platform for researching multiparty multiobjective optimization algorithms.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark suite to promote advances in this relatively less studied area of multiparty multiobjective optimization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-part benchmark suite for evaluating algorithms on multiparty multiobjective optimization problems (MPMOPs). What is the key distinction between the two parts of the benchmark suite and what purpose does this distinction serve?

2. The first part of the benchmark suite consists of 11 problems with common Pareto optimal solutions sourced from literature. What is the rationale behind using problems with known Pareto optimal solutions in evaluating algorithm performance? 

3. The second part of the benchmark suite comprises six biparty multiobjective UAV path planning (BPMO-UAVPP) problems with unknown optimal solutions. What new challenges do these problems present compared to the first part? How does the choice of performance metrics address these challenges?

4. The paper suggests using the multiparty inverted generational distance (MPIGD) metric to evaluate algorithm performance on the first part of the benchmark suite. What are the advantages and potential limitations of using MPIGD versus other metrics?

5. For the second part of the benchmark suite, multiparty hypervolume (MPHV) is proposed as the performance metric. What properties of MPHV make it suitable for problems with unknown Pareto fronts? What are some limitations?

6. The BPMO-UAVPP problem formulation includes four objectives under the efficiency decision-maker. Discuss the interactions and potential conflicts between these different efficiency objectives during optimization.  

7. The safety decision-maker balances three risk factors - fatality, property damage, and noise pollution. In what situations might these factors align versus conflict for the safety decision-maker?

8. What constraints are imposed on the UAV path planning problem? How might these constraints impact convergence to the Pareto optimal front for the biparty objectives?

9. The paper notes the flexibility of the benchmark suite for expansion. Propose one additional test case for the BPMO-UAVPP benchmark and outline relevant objectives and constraints.  

10. The performance metrics used in the paper equally weight the multiple decision-makers. Discuss the implications of this choice and how alternate weighting schemes could be integrated.
