# [ZeroAvatar: Zero-shot 3D Avatar Generation from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16411)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we generate high-fidelity 3D avatars from single images in a zero-shot manner by leveraging pretrained generative models?The key hypothesis appears to be: By incorporating an explicit 3D human body prior (SMPL model) along with a depth-conditioned sampling strategy and UV-guided texture regularization, we can significantly improve the geometry and appearance of zero-shot optimized 3D avatars compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, the paper proposes a zero-shot 3D avatar generation method called ZeroAvatar that introduces a parametric human body model and other regularization strategies into the optimization process to address limitations in preserving complex human geometry faced by previous zero-shot 3D generation techniques. The central hypothesis is that by incorporating these explicit inductive biases related to human structure and appearance, ZeroAvatar can achieve superior fidelity and realism compared to current state-of-the-art in image-conditioned zero-shot 3D optimization.
