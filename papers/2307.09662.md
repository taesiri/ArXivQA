# [Object-aware Gaze Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09662)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform gaze target detection in an explainable manner by modeling the relationship between people's heads and gazed objects in the scene. The key hypotheses are:1) Modeling head-object interactions and relationships will improve gaze target detection performance compared to just using holistic scene features or cropped head images.2) Detecting, localizing, and classifying gazed objects in addition to predicting gaze heatmaps will enable more explainable gaze analysis. 3) A Transformer-based architecture can effectively model head-object relationships and simultaneously perform gaze heatmap regression and objected detection/classification for explainable gaze target analysis.In summary, the main goal is to develop a gaze target detection method that not only accurately predicts where people are looking but also explains the predictions by identifying which objects people are looking at. This is in contrast to prior work which focuses only on predicting gaze heatmaps without explicitly modeling object interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel object-oriented gaze target detection method based on a Transformer architecture. 2. The model can automatically detect heads and objects in the scene and build associations between each head and the gazed object/head. This allows for explainable gaze analysis by predicting the gaze target area, gaze pixel point, class of gazed object, and bounding box of gazed object. 3. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard gaze target detection benchmarks like GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget. It improves AUC by up to 2.91%, reduces gaze distance by 50%, and increases out-of-frame AP by 9% compared to prior work.4. The model also shows 11-13% improvement in AP for gazed object classification and localization compared to using an off-the-shelf object detector. 5. The proposed gaze cone predictor and gaze object transformer modules are shown to be important components through ablation studies.6. The method performs well even in cases of high variance across multiple gaze annotations for the same image.7. Code is made publicly available to facilitate further research.In summary, the key contribution is a new Transformer-based architecture for object-aware gaze target detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides more explainable gaze analysis by detecting relevant objects like heads and modeling their relationships. The object-oriented design and components like the gaze cone predictor and transformer are critical to the method's success.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a Transformer-based architecture for gaze target detection that detects objects (including heads) to build associations between heads and gazed objects, enabling the prediction of the gaze area, gaze pixel point, gazed object class and location, and whether the gaze point is out of frame, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on gaze target detection:- Most prior work uses a two-branch model architecture, with one branch processing the scene image and the other processing head crops. This paper proposes a novel Transformer-based architecture that detects objects in the scene and models relationships between heads and objects. - Previous methods require manually annotated head crops during both training and inference. This limits their practical applicability. The proposed method detects heads automatically, removing this requirement.- Prior work focuses only on predicting the gaze target location. This paper additionally classifies the object being looked at and localizes it, enabling more explainable predictions. - Many recent methods incorporate multiple modalities like depth maps or temporal information. This paper achieves state-of-the-art results using only RGB images as input.- The proposed Transformer architecture allows simultaneous gaze prediction for multiple people in a scene. Most prior work is limited to detecting the gaze of a single pre-specified person.- The ablation studies demonstrate the importance of key components like the object masking and gaze cone modeling. This provides insights into gaze behavior analysis using object interactions.In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in gaze target detection through a new Transformer-based architecture that enables explainable multi-person gaze analysis using only RGB images, outperforming prior work relying on complex multi-modal pipelines. The design and analysis shed light on modeling gaze as a relationship between people and objects.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Investigating gaze target detection within the open-set object detection paradigms. The current method relies on a fixed set of object classes. An open-set approach could handle novel/unseen objects in the wild.- Improving the efficiency and convergence of the Transformer-based model. The authors note their model currently requires long training epochs due to the nature of Transformers. Exploring ways to speed up training could be useful.- Incorporating eye position and gaze direction more explicitly. The authors mention accurately predicting gaze vectors likely requires modeling eyes more directly. Integrating eye feature extraction into the model architecture could be worthwhile.- Exploring temporal models for video gaze target detection. The current work focuses on images. Expanding to leverage temporal video information could improve performance.- Studying broader applications of the explainable gaze analysis provided by the model. The authors developed their model to detect objects being gazed at for improved explainability. Applying this capability to areas like human-robot interaction or psychology could be impactful.- Considering privacy protection and policies when deploying the model in real-world usage. Since the model processes human faces, privacy issues should be reviewed.In summary, the main future directions are improving the model efficiency, generalization, and explainability, expanding to videos, exploring applications, and considering privacy when deploying the system. The overall goal seems to be developing the technology further to handle real-world gaze analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a Transformer-based architecture for explainable gaze target detection that can detect the gaze targets of multiple people in an image. The model first uses an Object Detector Transformer to detect all objects, including heads, in the scene. Then for each detected head, a Gaze Cone Predictor estimates a 3D gaze vector which is used to build a gaze cone representing the person's field of view. The objects inside this cone are more likely to be gazed at. A Gaze Object Transformer then models relationships between heads and objects and outputs a heatmap predicting the gaze target area and point for each person. The network also classifies the object being looked at and localizes it with a bounding box to provide an explainable gaze analysis. Evaluated on gaze datasets, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on gaze target detection metrics and gazed object classification/localization while handling multiple people and without requiring manual head crops like prior works. The gaze cone modeling and Gaze Object Transformer are shown to be important components through ablation studies.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a Transformer-based architecture for explainable gaze target detection. The method detects objects (including heads) in an input scene image using an Object Detector Transformer. For each detected head, a gaze vector is predicted and used to build a gaze cone representing the person's field of view. This allows filtering of irrelevant objects. A Gaze Object Transformer then models relationships between heads and objects to produce a heatmap centered on the gaze point. The architecture can detect gaze targets for multiple people simultaneously. It also localizes and classifies the gazed object for each person, enabling an explainable analysis of who is looking where and at what. Evaluations on benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art performance on gaze target detection metrics. The method also outperforms baselines on gazed object classification and localization. Ablations validate the contributions of key components like the Gaze Cone Predictor and Gaze Object Transformer.In summary, the paper introduces a new object-oriented and Transformer-based model for simultaneously detecting the gaze targets of multiple people in a scene. It goes beyond prior works by also determining the class and location of gazed objects, enabling explainable gaze analysis. The proposed architecture achieves top results on standard benchmarks and ablation studies confirm the importance of its main technical contributions. The work represents an advance in explainable automated gaze understanding for human interaction analysis.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a Transformer-based architecture for object-aware gaze target detection. Given an input image, the model first uses an Object Detector Transformer to detect all objects, including heads, in the scene. For each detected head, a gaze vector is predicted using a Gaze Cone Predictor module. This gaze vector is used to build a gaze cone representing the person's field of view. Objects inside this cone are likely gaze targets. An object score matrix is computed based on the gaze cones and object locations. This matrix is used to bias the attention in a Gaze Object Transformer module, which models interactions between heads and objects and ultimately predicts a gaze heatmap for each person. If no object falls inside a person's gaze cone, the heatmap is predicted directly from their head features using a skip connection. The model is trained end-to-end using losses for object detection, gaze vector regression, heatmap prediction, and out-of-frame gaze classification. Key components include the Gaze Cone Predictor to focus attention on relevant objects and the Gaze Object Transformer to model head-object interactions for gaze target detection.
