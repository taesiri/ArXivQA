# [eCIL-MU: Embedding based Class Incremental Learning and Machine   Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02457)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Class incremental learning (CIL) allows models to sequentially learn new classes over time while retaining knowledge of old classes. However, old categories may need to be removed (e.g. due to changes in data or privacy regulations). 
- Existing machine unlearning (MU) methods that remove class influence are often slow and repeatedly modifying the model risks catastrophic forgetting. 
- It is challenging to achieve both CIL and MU simultaneously within the same model framework.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a framework called eCIL-MU that integrates both class incremental learning and machine unlearning capabilities. 
- An embedding model maps input data into latent vector representations that are stored in vector databases for both learned classes (DB-CIL) and classes to be unlearned (DB-MU). 
- Vectors from DB-CIL are transferred to DB-MU for unlearning classes based on a cosine similarity measure to identify related vectors.
- During inference, a vector filter checks if inputs match DB-MU to determine if they should be unlearned or use the standard CIL-MU model.
- For unlearned classes, four strategies are explored to predict alternative outputs rather than the true labels.

Contributions:
- Combining CIL and MU within a single framework by modifying data instead of the model itself, avoiding destructive updates.
- Use of vector databases and migration based on similarity enables acceleration via partial overlap of CIL and MU processes.
- Analysis of four output strategies for unlearned classes shows nearest class shifting maintains model robustness against catastrophic forgetting.
- Experiments validate unlearning effectiveness and significant speed ups compared to baseline methods.

In summary, the eCIL-MU framework leverages embedding techniques and vector databases to efficiently integrate class incremental learning and machine unlearning in a non-destructive manner while preserving model performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an embedding-based framework for class incremental learning and machine unlearning (eCIL-MU) that achieves effective unlearning and acceleration by mapping data to vector representations, storing them in databases, and transferring vectors between databases for learned and unlearned classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the eCIL-MU framework by integrating class incremental learning (CIL) and class-level machine unlearning (MU). This allows learning new classes while removing outdated ones. 

2. Modifying data rather than the CIL-MU model itself, leading to a non-destructive unlearning approach. Specifically, an embedding technique is used to map training data into vectors, which are then stored and unlearned from vector databases.

3. Devising separate vector databases within the CIL-MU model to store vectors for both learned and unlearned classes. Vectors are transferred between these databases based on cosine similarity, exploiting the overlap between CIL and MU tasks for acceleration.

4. Applying and comparing four different output strategies for unlearning classes during the inference phase. The strategy of shifting predictions to the nearest class is found to achieve non-destructive effects while also delaying catastrophic forgetting.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the integrated eCIL-MU framework and its non-destructive unlearning approach based on data modifications and vector database transfers, while also analyzing different strategies for handling unlearned classes.

The paper proposes an embedding based Class Incremental Learning and Machine Unlearning (eCIL-MU) framework that integrates CIL and class-level MU. It employs embedding techniques to map training data into vectors, stores them in vector databases, and transfers vectors between databases for CIL and MU tasks. Four output strategies are explored for unlearning classes. Experiments on CIFAR datasets demonstrate the framework's capabilities in achieving unlearning effectiveness and acceleration through exploiting overlap between CIL and MU.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around incremental learning, machine unlearning, embeddings, vector databases, privacy, and mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting.
