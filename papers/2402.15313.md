# [ArabianGPT: Native Arabic GPT-based Large Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15313)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of large language models (LLMs) focused specifically on processing native Arabic text. Existing models rely heavily on English/Latin tokens, limiting their ability to effectively handle the complex morphology and syntax of Arabic.

Solution:
- The paper proposes ArabianGPT, a suite of transformer-based LLMs explicitly designed for Arabic as part of the broader ArabianLLM initiative. Models of varying sizes are introduced, including ArabianGPT-0.1B and ArabianGPT-0.3B.

- A key innovation is AraNizer, a customized tokenizer for Arabic text segmentation attuned to the language's linguistic nuances. This enables more accurate textual analysis.

Contributions:
- The architecture and training process of ArabianGPT focuses on adapting to Arabic's syntactic and morphological complexity.

- Empirical results demonstrate significant gains from fine-tuning. For sentiment analysis, ArabianGPT-0.1B achieved 95% accuracy, up from 56% for the base model.

- Comparative analyses reveal differences in performance across benchmarks. Fine-tuning positively impacts specific tasks like question answering and summarization.

- ArabianGPT models help advance Arabic NLP by bridging the gap in native Arabic LLMs. The tailored transformer design and innovations like AraNizer pave the way for future progress.

In summary, the ArabianGPT suite spearheaded by AraNizer represents a specialized LLM approach catered to Arabic's linguistic needs, with empirical gains showing the promise of this direction.
