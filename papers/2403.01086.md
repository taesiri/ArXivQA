# [phloSAR: a Portable, High-Flow Pressure Supply and Regulator Enabling   Untethered Operation of Large Pneumatic Soft Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pneumatic actuation is useful for soft robots as it enables compliance, volume change, and lightweight. However, pneumatic soft robots (PSRs) typically require tethering to heavy, bulky air compressors which limits their mobility.
- Existing portable pneumatic solutions are limited in supply pressure, flow rate, and overall capacity which constrains their applicability to small, slow PSRs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a portable, high-flow pressure supply and regulator (phloSAR) to enable untethered operation of large, dynamic PSRs.

Key Contributions:
- Design and modeling of the phloSAR system which uses high-flow proportional valves, an integrated air reservoir, and a Venturi vacuum pump to achieve portability along with high pressure and flow capacity.
- Models to describe phloSAR dynamics including reservoir discharge over time, inflation speed, and frequency response. Models are experimentally validated.
- Guidelines for selecting phloSAR components based on the pneumatic requirements of the target soft robot. Metrics provided include number of achievable inflation-deflation cycles.  
- Demonstration of the phloSAR powering a soft robot manipulator mounted on a drone, enabling mobile operation not previously possible with the robot's pneumatic needs.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling untethered high-flow pneumatic supply with a compact, integrated system design. This expands the capability and mobility of soft robots by eliminating the need for tethered compressors. The modeling and component selection guidance provides a design framework for building custom phloSARs for different soft robots.
