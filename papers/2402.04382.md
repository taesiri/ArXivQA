# [Counterfactual Generation with Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04382)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models used in high-stakes decision making (e.g. loan approvals) are often black boxes, unable to explain their predictions.  
- When people receive unfavorable outcomes from these models, they desire satisfactory explanations to understand why the decision was made. 
- Providing such explanations is challenging. One approach is to generate counterfactual explanations - explanations of what changes could have led to a favorable outcome.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a framework called "Counterfactual Generation with s(CASP)" (CFGS) to automatically generate counterfactual explanations. 
- The framework utilizes answer set programming (ASP) and the s(CASP) goal-directed ASP system to generate explanations by imagining alternate worlds where some facts are different, leading to favorable outcomes.
- It takes rules generated by rule-based machine learning (RBML) algorithms as input. Using ASP negation and s(CASP)'s automatic "dual rules", it constructs negated queries to find worlds where the original unfavorable outcome does not hold.
- It models causal relationships between features to generate realistic counterfactual worlds/explanations.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates generating counterfactual explanations with ASP and s(CASP) by imagining alternate possible worlds through negated queries and dual rules.
- Incorporates causal relationships between features to produce realistic counterfactual explanations.
- Framework works for rules from any RBML algorithm. Allows injecting additional domain knowledge rules.
- Measures cost of interventions required to generate counterfactuals. Allows specifying constraints on allowable feature changes.
- Evaluated on multiple datasets with rules from RBML algorithms. Shows capability to generate counterfactuals regardless of RBML algorithm used.
