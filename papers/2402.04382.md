# [Counterfactual Generation with Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04382)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models used in high-stakes decision making (e.g. loan approvals) are often black boxes, unable to explain their predictions.  
- When people receive unfavorable outcomes from these models, they desire satisfactory explanations to understand why the decision was made. 
- Providing such explanations is challenging. One approach is to generate counterfactual explanations - explanations of what changes could have led to a favorable outcome.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a framework called "Counterfactual Generation with s(CASP)" (CFGS) to automatically generate counterfactual explanations. 
- The framework utilizes answer set programming (ASP) and the s(CASP) goal-directed ASP system to generate explanations by imagining alternate worlds where some facts are different, leading to favorable outcomes.
- It takes rules generated by rule-based machine learning (RBML) algorithms as input. Using ASP negation and s(CASP)'s automatic "dual rules", it constructs negated queries to find worlds where the original unfavorable outcome does not hold.
- It models causal relationships between features to generate realistic counterfactual worlds/explanations.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates generating counterfactual explanations with ASP and s(CASP) by imagining alternate possible worlds through negated queries and dual rules.
- Incorporates causal relationships between features to produce realistic counterfactual explanations.
- Framework works for rules from any RBML algorithm. Allows injecting additional domain knowledge rules.
- Measures cost of interventions required to generate counterfactuals. Allows specifying constraints on allowable feature changes.
- Evaluated on multiple datasets with rules from RBML algorithms. Shows capability to generate counterfactuals regardless of RBML algorithm used.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Counterfactual Generation with s(CASP) (CFGS) that utilizes answer set programming and the s(CASP) goal-directed ASP system to automatically generate counterfactual explanations from rules produced by rule-based machine learning algorithms, while taking into account causal dependencies between features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The CFGS framework that shows that complex tasks such as imagining possible scenarios, which is essential in generating counterfactuals, can be modeled with s(CASP) while taking causal dependencies between features into account. The s(CASP) system allows for counterfactual situations to be imagined and reasoned about automatically by utilizing its support for negation as failure and dual rules to generate alternate worlds.

In summary, the main contribution is a framework called CFGS that demonstrates how answer set programming (ASP) and the goal-directed s(CASP) system can be used to automatically generate counterfactual explanations from machine learning models, while accounting for causal relationships between input features.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Counterfactual explanations - The paper focuses on automatically generating counterfactual explanations to explain decisions and inform how to achieve a desired outcome. Counterfactuals refer to imagined alternative scenarios where different facts hold.

- Answer set programming (ASP) - The paper utilizes ASP, specifically the goal-directed s(CASP) system, to represent knowledge and automate commonsense reasoning required for counterfactual generation. 

- Rule-based machine learning (RBML) - The framework takes as input classification rules generated by RBML algorithms like FOLD-SE and RIPPER. The counterfactuals are computed from these rules.

- Causal reasoning - The paper incorporates causal dependencies between features when generating counterfactuals, to ensure the explanations recommend realistic changes. 

- Close possible worlds - The idea behind counterfactuals is traversing from the current world to alternate, reasonably close worlds where desired outcomes hold. The paper shows how to navigate these worlds in ASP.

- Dual rules - s(CASP) automatically generates dual rules that allow negated queries to be executed, which enables imagining counterfactual situations.

In summary, the key terms cover counterfactual reasoning, answer set programming, rule-based ML, causal reasoning, possible worlds, and dual rules for negation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions taking causal dependencies between features into account when generating counterfactual explanations. Can you expand more on why considering causality is important here? What issues could arise if causal relationships are not properly modeled? 

2. One key aspect is the use of "dual rules" in s(CASP) to allow negated queries to be executed. Can you walk through an example in more detail of how a negated query leads to the generation of a counterfactual instance?

3. The methodology involves defining the domains and properties of features, incorporating causal rules, specifying decision-making rules, executing counterfactual queries in s(CASP), and restricting feature changes. Can you expand more on how each of these steps fits together in the overall framework?

4. How does the framework utilize answer set programming and the s(CASP) system specifically to facilitate commonsense reasoning needed for counterfactual generation? Can you illustrate with an example?  

5. The framework aims to find minimal interventions to go from an undesired outcome to a desired one. How specifically is the "cost" of interventions calculated? And how is this cost used to guide counterfactual generation?

6. You make a distinction between pre-intervention and post-intervention worlds. What is the significance of modeling these separate worlds? How does the framework transition between these worlds?

7. When restricting features, how does the framework deal with numerical versus categorical features differently in terms of determining if they can be intervened? 

8. One contribution highlighted is the ability to inject user-defined rules into the system when needed. In what cases might this functionality be valuable? Can you provide examples?

9. The framework is model-agnostic and can work with different rule-based ML algorithms. How does the output of the ML algorithm integrate into the overall counterfactual generation pipeline?  

10. The methodology models multiple possible worlds to find counterfactuals. Can you elaborate on the connection to possible worlds semantics and how ASP/s(CASP) facilitates this?
