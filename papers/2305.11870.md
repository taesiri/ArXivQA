# [Chupa: Carving 3D Clothed Humans from Skinned Shape Priors using 2D   Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11870)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How can we generate realistic 3D clothed human avatars by leveraging recent advances in generative image models and differentiable rendering?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) By decomposing the 3D avatar generation problem into 2D normal map generation and subsequent normal map-based 3D reconstruction, the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models can be leveraged for this task. 2) Diffusion models can be adapted to generate consistent dual normal maps (front and back views) of clothed humans conditioned on body pose. These can provide sufficient information to reconstruct a plausible 3D human mesh.3) The generated normal maps and reconstructed mesh can be further refined through a resampling process using additional diffusion models, enhancing quality while preserving consistency. 4) By incorporating text-to-image diffusion models, the pipeline can be extended to allow text-based control over human identity and attributes.In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a novel 3D human generation pipeline exploiting the complementary strengths of generative image models, differentiable rendering, and skinned shape models to address the challenging problem of creating varied, realistic digital human avatars.
