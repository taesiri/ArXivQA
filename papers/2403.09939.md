# [Quantization Effects on Neural Networks Perception: How would   quantization change the perceptual field of vision models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09939)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Neural network quantization can reduce model size and enable deployment on resource-constrained devices, but may impact model interpretability. Understanding the effects of quantization on class activation maps (CAMs) is important for ensuring efficient and interpretable models. 

Methods:
The authors evaluated 6 CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, DenseNet) on 10,000 ImageNet validation images. They quantized the models to int8, int16 and float32 precision using PyTorch's quantization aware training. They computed CAMs using GradCAM++ and compared to human visual saliency maps from SATSal using similarity, correlation and KL divergence metrics.

Key Findings:  
- Int16 quantization overall aligns better with human perception than int8/f32 based on metrics. This may be due to preserved noise at higher precision or lost information at lower precision.
- MobileNet and SqueezeNet were most robust to quantization changes. Overparameterized models like VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121 also showed robustness likely due to parameter redundancy.  
- EfficientNet suffered the most degradation, indicating it does not preserve perceptual information well under quantization.

Main Contributions:
- Rigorously evaluated effects of quantization on CNN perceptual fields across diverse architectures
- Identified nuanced sensitivities to quantization changes in terms of human perceptual alignment
- Provides guidance for choosing efficient and interpretable models for deployment based on robustness to quantization

The key insight is that quantization can alter model visual perception differently depending on the architecture. Understanding these effects is crucial for maintaining efficiency as well as interpretability for practical applications.
