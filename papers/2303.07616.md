# The Life Cycle of Knowledge in Big Language Models: A Survey

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper does not seem to have a clearly stated central research question or hypothesis. However, based on my reading, the main focus of the paper appears to be reviewing and summarizing the existing literature on the "life cycle" of knowledge in pre-trained language models. Specifically, the authors divide this life cycle into five key stages:1) Knowledge acquisition: How PLMs acquire knowledge from textual data or other structured knowledge sources during pre-training.2) Knowledge representation: How different types of knowledge are encoded and represented within the parameters of PLMs. 3) Knowledge probing: Methods for evaluating the knowledge contained in PLMs.4) Knowledge editing: Techniques for modifying incorrect or outdated knowledge in PLMs.5) Knowledge application: How the knowledge in PLMs can be utilized for downstream tasks.For each stage, the authors review relevant prior work, summarize the main challenges and limitations, and discuss potential future research directions. The paper does not appear to have a single central hypothesis that is being tested. Rather, it provides a broad survey and analysis of the existing literature on this topic from a knowledge engineering perspective. The main goal seems to be to promote a more unified understanding of knowledge in PLMs across the different stages of the knowledge life cycle.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the life cycle of knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs). The key contributions are:1. It proposes a novel perspective to view PLMs as knowledge-based systems and divides the knowledge life cycle into 5 critical periods - acquisition, representation, probing, editing, and application. 2. It provides a systematic review of existing studies for each period of the knowledge life cycle. The paper summarizes the main approaches, datasets, challenges, and limitations for knowledge acquisition, representation, probing, editing, and application in PLMs.3. Based on the unified perspective, the paper discusses connections and missing links between different periods of the knowledge life cycle. For example, understanding knowledge representation is valuable for better acquisition and editing strategies.4. The paper summarizes the main challenges and limitations of current research on each aspect of the knowledge life cycle. It also provides insights into potential future directions, such as building comprehensive benchmarks, developing debiased probing methods, designing more effective editing approaches, etc.5. The unified view of the knowledge life cycle provides a novel angle to understand the landscape of PLM research. It can help readers gain a systematic understanding of this area and shed light on promising directions for future investigation. Overall, the paper makes significant contributions to knowledge-related PLM research.In summary, the key contribution is providing a holistic overview of knowledge in PLMs throughout the entire life cycle, revealing connections between different stages, summarizing limitations of existing studies, and discussing future directions. The comprehensive survey offers a valuable resource and novel perspective for PLM knowledge research.
