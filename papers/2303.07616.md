# [The Life Cycle of Knowledge in Big Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07616)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not seem to have a clearly stated central research question or hypothesis. However, based on my reading, the main focus of the paper appears to be reviewing and summarizing the existing literature on the "life cycle" of knowledge in pre-trained language models. 

Specifically, the authors divide this life cycle into five key stages:

1) Knowledge acquisition: How PLMs acquire knowledge from textual data or other structured knowledge sources during pre-training.

2) Knowledge representation: How different types of knowledge are encoded and represented within the parameters of PLMs. 

3) Knowledge probing: Methods for evaluating the knowledge contained in PLMs.

4) Knowledge editing: Techniques for modifying incorrect or outdated knowledge in PLMs.

5) Knowledge application: How the knowledge in PLMs can be utilized for downstream tasks.

For each stage, the authors review relevant prior work, summarize the main challenges and limitations, and discuss potential future research directions. 

The paper does not appear to have a single central hypothesis that is being tested. Rather, it provides a broad survey and analysis of the existing literature on this topic from a knowledge engineering perspective. The main goal seems to be to promote a more unified understanding of knowledge in PLMs across the different stages of the knowledge life cycle.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my understanding of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

1. Broader range of target knowledge - The authors point out that most existing knowledge editing studies focus on factual knowledge, and suggest exploring methods that can edit other types of knowledge like commonsense, procedural, etc. in a generalizable way. 

2. Comprehensive evaluation - The authors suggest designing benchmarks that can more comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of knowledge editing approaches, beyond just the editing success rate. For example, evaluating effects on downstream tasks, unrelated knowledge, consistency across paraphrasing, etc.

3. More effective editing approaches - The authors suggest exploring ideas from meta-learning, continual learning etc. to develop editing methods that are more efficient, reliable and consistent. Connecting editing with knowledge representation is also mentioned.

4. Knowledge acquisition from text - Understanding the underlying mechanisms of how PLMs acquire knowledge from text, and developing more controllable/predictable algorithms for learning specific knowledge.

5. Comprehensive probing benchmarks - Developing less specialized, more comprehensive probing benchmarks to avoid inconsistent or unreliable assessment of language models' knowledge.

6. Debiased probing approaches - Addressing issues with existing prompting methods and developing more robust probing frameworks.

7. Knowledge application - For LM-as-KBs, improving consistency and reliability; For downstream tasks, exploring more tuning-free or black-box tuning paradigms.

8. Knowledge representation - Drawing ideas from cognitive science to design analysis methods; Comparing knowledge representations across knowledge types and model architectures.

In summary, the key suggestions are around developing more generalized techniques for editing, acquiring and probing knowledge, more comprehensive evaluation, and gaining a deeper understanding of knowledge representation in language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified framework to investigate the life cycle of knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs) from a knowledge engineering perspective. The life cycle is divided into five critical periods - knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, knowledge probing, knowledge editing, and knowledge application. For each period, the authors review existing studies, analyze main challenges and limitations, and discuss future directions. They argue that current research is fragmented, focusing only on specific stages of the knowledge life cycle. By providing a holistic view, this survey aims to elucidate connections between different knowledge-related tasks, discover missing links in PLM knowledge research, and gain a deeper understanding of knowledge in PLMs. The key idea is to view PLMs as knowledge-based systems and examine how knowledge circulates as it is acquired, encoded, evaluated, modified and leveraged. This unified perspective can inform better strategies for acquiring, representing, probing, editing and applying knowledge in PLMs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper surveys the life cycle of knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs). It divides the life cycle into five critical periods: knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, knowledge probing, knowledge editing, and knowledge application. 

The paper reviews existing work on each of these five periods. For knowledge acquisition, it discusses learning from both text data and structured data. For knowledge representation, it introduces gradient-based, causal, attention-based, and layer-wise analysis methods. For knowledge probing, it summarizes probing benchmarks and analyzes prompt-based and feature-based probing approaches. For knowledge editing, it describes constrained fine-tuning, memory-based, meta-learning, and locate-and-edit methods. Finally, for knowledge application, it differentiates between using PLMs as knowledge bases versus using PLMs for downstream tasks. For each period, the paper summarizes main challenges and limitations and suggests future directions. The unified perspective allows understanding connections between different knowledge tasks and utilizing these connections for further improvement.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompt-based method to probe factual knowledge in pre-trained language models. Specifically, the authors first manually construct a set of cloze-style prompts to query different types of factual knowledge, such as "The capital of France is [MASK]." Then they feed these prompts into pre-trained language models like BERT and use the models' predicted token at the masked position as the answer. To improve the models' performance, the authors further propose an automatic prompt generation approach based on gradient-guided search. It iteratively updates a prompt from a single [MASK] token by greedily selecting the token that maximizes the log-likelihood of label words on a small training set. Experiments on various factual knowledge datasets show their automatically generated prompts lead to significant performance gains compared to manually created prompts. Overall, the prompt-based probing provides an effective way to assess the factual knowledge stored in pre-trained language models' parameters.
