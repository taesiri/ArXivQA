# [STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be that an iterative process of self-generating rationales and explanations, combined with model fine-tuning, can allow a large language model to bootstrap its own reasoning abilities from just a few initial examples. 

Specifically, the authors propose a technique called "Self-Taught Reasoner" (STaR) which involves:

- Using a few initial rationale examples to prompt the model to generate step-by-step rationales and explanations to solve problems. 

- Fine-tuning the model on the generated rationales that led to correct answers.

- Adding a "rationalization" step where the model is given hints of the correct answers for problems it failed, and asked to generate rationales for those. 

- Iteratively repeating this process of rationale generation, rationalization, and fine-tuning.

The central hypothesis is that this iterative bootstrapping process will allow the model to progressively improve its own reasoning and explanation abilities over multiple rounds, starting from just a small number of initial examples. The authors test this on arithmetic, commonsense QA, and math word problems.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that models can self-improve reasoning through iterative self-generation and learning from rationales, without needing massive labeled rationale datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- Proposing a bootstrapping mechanism called STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner) that allows large language models to iteratively generate better rationales and improve performance on reasoning tasks. 

- Introducing a technique called "rationalization" where the model is provided with the correct answer as a hint and asked to generate a rationale justifying that answer. This helps expand the training data and improves the bootstrapping process.

- Evaluating STaR on symbolic reasoning (arithmetic), natural language reasoning (CommonsenseQA), and mathematical word problems (GSM8K). Experiments show STaR significantly improves performance compared to baselines without rationales or bootstrapping.

- Demonstrating that STaR allows a 6B parameter model (GPT-J) to achieve comparable performance to a much larger 175B model (GPT-3) on CommonsenseQA through iterative self-improvement.

- Proposing a general technique for large language models to leverage their existing skills to iteratively improve reasoning ability from only a small number of example rationales, without requiring large annotated training sets.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a method for large language models to bootstrap reasoning ability from just a few examples, through iteratively generating and learning from their own rationales. The key ideas are rationale generation, rationalization, and iterative self-improvement.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding of the paper, here is a summary in one sentence:

The paper proposes a bootstrapping technique called Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) that allows large language models to iteratively improve their reasoning abilities by generating and learning from their own rationales on datasets without explicit rationales.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of language model training and reasoning:

- It proposes a new method, STaR, for iteratively improving a language model's ability to generate step-by-step rationales and solve challenging reasoning tasks. This builds on prior work showing the benefits of rationale generation, but provides a new training approach.

- Most prior work has focused on training language models directly on large datasets of problems with or without rationales. STaR shows how to bootstrap reasoning from just a small number of examples. This makes it more scalable.

- The paper demonstrates strong performance improvements on arithmetic, commonsense QA, and math word problems compared to few-shot baselines. On CommonsenseQA it achieves similar accuracy to fine-tuning a much larger model directly on the full dataset. This shows the effectiveness of the approach.

- Rationalization is a novel technique introduced in this paper to provide additional training signal. Prior work has not explored generating rationales for initially incorrect answers and training on those.

- The iterative self-training loop in STaR is inspired by prior methods like expert iteration, but tailored for language model reasoning here.

- The paper connects STaR to reinforcement learning objectives related to maximizing rewards on training data. This provides a theoretical grounding.

- Overall, STaR demonstrates a new way to leverage language models' own reasoning and knowledge to improve at complex tasks. The results advance capabilities in mathematical and commonsense reasoning compared to other recent methods.

In summary, the key novelties are in the training approach and incorporation of rationalization. The empirical gains on multiple reasoning tasks help validate the efficacy of STaR compared to alternative techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing techniques to generate higher quality rationales, especially ones that better reflect the model's actual reasoning process. The authors point out limitations around evaluating the faithfulness of rationales generated by models like STaR. They suggest more research is needed into ensuring rationales accurately represent the model's reasoning.

- Studying the interaction between dataset bias and model bias when amplifying reasoning with techniques like STaR. The authors note that STaR amplifies the reasoning that leads to correct solutions on a dataset, so biases that help solve the dataset will also be amplified. More work is needed to understand this interaction.

- Applying STaR to more domains and evaluating its effectiveness. The authors demonstrate it on arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and grade school math problems. They suggest it could be a general technique applicable across many domains, which merits further exploration. 

- Developing more sophisticated prompting techniques for rationalization, beyond just providing the answer. The authors note the method for adding hints during rationalization may not generalize well, and suggest researching alternate prompting approaches.

- Thorough hyperparameter search and tuning for STaR. The authors did only limited tuning given computational constraints, but suggest more tuning could further improve results.

- Connecting STaR more formally to reinforcement learning objectives and analyzing it through that lens. The authors draw parallels to RL but leave formal theoretical study for future work.

- Developing mechanisms to filter poor reasoning in settings where chance performance is high. The authors note STaR can break down when many bad rationales still lead to chance correct answers.

- Applying STaR to larger language models. The authors found GPT-2 was unable to bootstrap reasoning, suggesting a certain model size may be needed. Trying larger models would be informative.

Those seem to be some of the main directions suggested for taking this line of research further. The core ideas could be expanded on in many ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. The key idea is to leverage the model's existing capabilities to iteratively generate training data to improve its reasoning skills. 

Specifically, STaR starts with a small set of example rationales that demonstrate step-by-step reasoning. It uses these to prompt the model to generate rationales and answers for a large dataset of problems. Rationales leading to correct answers are used as training data to fine-tune the model. This improved model is then used to generate rationales and answers again on the dataset. This loop of rationale generation, filtering, and fine-tuning is repeated, so the model's improving ability to generate rationales in turn improves the training data. 

Additionally, for problems the model cannot initially solve, it performs "rationalization" where it is given the answer and must generate an appropriate rationale. This exposes the model to more complex examples.

Experiments show STaR significantly improves performance on arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and math word problems compared to standard training. It achieves accuracy comparable to much larger models trained directly on the full datasets. Thus, STaR allows models to iteratively bootstrap their own reasoning abilities from just a few examples.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new technique called "Self-Taught Reasoner" (STaR) to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models. STaR relies on an iterative process of generating rationales, fine-tuning the model on correct rationales, and generating more rationales with the improved model. 

Specifically, STaR first prompts a large language model to generate step-by-step rationales to solve problems in a dataset, using a few example rationales as prompts. It then filters the generated rationales, keeping only those that led to correct answers. The model is fine-tuned on this filtered rationale dataset. This process is repeated, each time generating rationales with the newly fine-tuned model. A key contribution is "rationalization", where for problems the model gets wrong, it is prompted to generate a rationale given the correct answer as a hint. This exposes the model to more difficult examples. Experiments on arithmetic, commonsense QA, and grade school math show STaR substantially improves reasoning ability over baselines. The method requires no manually labeled rationales.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a technique called Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) that allows a large language model to iteratively improve its ability to generate step-by-step rationales and reasoning chains. It starts with a small set of example rationales that are provided to the model as prompts. The model then attempts to generate rationales and answers for a large dataset of problems. The generated rationales that lead to correct answers are used as training data to fine-tune the model. This process is repeated, with the improved model generating rationales on the dataset in each iteration. A key addition is "rationalization" - when the model fails to correctly answer a problem, it is given the correct answer as a hint and asked to generate a rationale justifying that answer. The rationalized examples are added to the training set. By iterating rationale generation, filtering, and fine-tuning, the model is able to bootstrap its reasoning ability from just a few examples.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to get large language models to perform more complex reasoning and improve their generalization ability, especially in domains like mathematics, commonsense reasoning, etc. 

Some key questions they are exploring:

- How can we get LLMs to generate explicit step-by-step reasoning ("rationales") to reach a conclusion, rather than just predicting the final answer directly? This kind of intermediate reasoning has been shown to improve performance.

- Current methods for getting LLMs to generate rationales rely on either creating massive training datasets of human-annotated rationales (expensive) or few-shot learning (limited performance). Is there a way to bootstrap reasoning ability from just a small number of examples?

- Can the model improve its own reasoning ability in an iterative, self-supervised way, by using its current capability to generate rationales on new data, then training on the generated rationales that led to correct answers?

So in summary, the main focus seems to be on developing methods to iteratively bootstrap an LLM's reasoning and generalization capability from small amounts of data, using a cycle of self-generated rationales and training. This allows the model to improve its reasoning without relying solely on large labeled training sets.
