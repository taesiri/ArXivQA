# [Chain of Code: Reasoning with a Language Model-Augmented Code Emulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04474)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes Chain of Code (CoC), a method that improves language model reasoning by having models write and execute code to solve problems. CoC has models generate code to break down reasoning into substeps. Then, a Python interpreter executes lines of code that it can, while for non-executable lines like those requiring common sense, the model simulates execution by predicting outputs. This interweaving of code execution and language model simulation enables leveraging the precision of code for algorithmic reasoning and the flexibility of language models for semantic reasoning. Experiments across challenging benchmarks demonstrate CoC's strong performance - it exceeds human raters on algorithmic BIG-Bench tasks and outperforms baselines like Chain of Thought overall. Qualitative examples highlight how CoC applies to diverse reasoning problems that involve both symbolic logic and semantics. The approach also generalizes to robotics applications like manipulating objects based on natural language instructions. By combining code's structure with language models' knowledge, the CoC method expands the scope of "thinking in code" for language model reasoning.
