# [EUGENE: Explainable Unsupervised Approximation of Graph Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Computing the Graph Edit Distance (GED) between two graphs is an important task with applications across domains, but it is NP-hard. Existing approaches to approximate GED have limitations:

(i) Neural methods lack interpretability as they don't provide the edit path corresponding to the predicted GED. 

(ii) Neural methods require expensive generation of ground-truth GEDs for training.

(iii) Neural methods need separate training for each dataset.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an efficient unsupervised algebraic method called EUGENE that approximates GED and provides an edit path explaining the estimated distance. EUGENE formulates the GED computation as an optimization problem over the space of permutation matrices. Since this problem is hard, EUGENE relaxes it to minimize over doubly stochastic matrices, which is convex and can be efficiently solved. The solution is refined to obtain a quasi-permutation matrix. Finally, a rounding algorithm converts the quasi-permutation matrix to a permutation matrix that represents the node alignment corresponding to the approximated GED.

Main Contributions:

- Establishes connection between two pivotal graph theory problems - Unrestricted Graph Alignment and Graph Edit Distance.

- Formulates GED computation as an optimization problem and provides an efficient approximate solution.

- Outputs an edit path explaining the approximated GED, providing interpretability.

- Avoids expensive ground truth generation and dataset-specific training unlike neural methods.

- Experiments show EUGENE matches or exceeds neural methods in accuracy, especially on large graphs, while being faster and not needing any training data.

In summary, EUGENE advances the state-of-the-art in interpretable and practical approximation of graph edit distance through an innovative algebraic optimization approach.
