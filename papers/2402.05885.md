# [EUGENE: Explainable Unsupervised Approximation of Graph Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Computing the Graph Edit Distance (GED) between two graphs is an important task with applications across domains, but it is NP-hard. Existing approaches to approximate GED have limitations:

(i) Neural methods lack interpretability as they don't provide the edit path corresponding to the predicted GED. 

(ii) Neural methods require expensive generation of ground-truth GEDs for training.

(iii) Neural methods need separate training for each dataset.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an efficient unsupervised algebraic method called EUGENE that approximates GED and provides an edit path explaining the estimated distance. EUGENE formulates the GED computation as an optimization problem over the space of permutation matrices. Since this problem is hard, EUGENE relaxes it to minimize over doubly stochastic matrices, which is convex and can be efficiently solved. The solution is refined to obtain a quasi-permutation matrix. Finally, a rounding algorithm converts the quasi-permutation matrix to a permutation matrix that represents the node alignment corresponding to the approximated GED.

Main Contributions:

- Establishes connection between two pivotal graph theory problems - Unrestricted Graph Alignment and Graph Edit Distance.

- Formulates GED computation as an optimization problem and provides an efficient approximate solution.

- Outputs an edit path explaining the approximated GED, providing interpretability.

- Avoids expensive ground truth generation and dataset-specific training unlike neural methods.

- Experiments show EUGENE matches or exceeds neural methods in accuracy, especially on large graphs, while being faster and not needing any training data.

In summary, EUGENE advances the state-of-the-art in interpretable and practical approximation of graph edit distance through an innovative algebraic optimization approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes EUGENE, an unsupervised algebraic method to efficiently approximate the graph edit distance between pairs of graphs while providing an explanatory edit path, without requiring expensive ground truth data generation or model training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It establishes a fundamental connection between two pivotal graph theory problems - Unrestricted Graph Alignment (UGA) and Graph Edit Distance (GED) - by proving that a UGA corresponds to a specific instance of GED. 

2) It formulates the GED computation problem as an optimization problem over the space of all possible node alignments, represented via permutation matrices. This formulation facilitates an unsupervised solution that does not require ground-truth data generation or dataset-specific training.

3) It presents an efficient algebraic unsupervised method called EUGENE to approximate GED. EUGENE minimizes a function over the set of doubly stochastic matrices, leading to a convex optimization problem, and refines the solution to obtain a quasi-permutation matrix. 

4) EUGENE yields a GED approximation that is explainable via a node-to-node correspondence. It also guarantees convergence through a customized parameter optimization strategy.

5) Extensive experiments demonstrate that EUGENE achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, while eliminating the need for ground truth generation and data-specific training. It shows superior performance especially on larger graphs.

In summary, the main contribution is an unsupervised, explainable GED approximation method with convergence guarantees that matches or exceeds neural supervised techniques without requiring expensive ground truth data.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Explainability: The paper aims to provide an explanatory edit path corresponding to the approximated GED cost.

- Optimization problem: The paper formulates the GED computation as an optimization problem over the space of doubly stochastic matrices.

- Convex relaxation: The hard optimization problem is relaxed into a convex one that can be efficiently solved. 

- Quasi-permutation matrix: The doubly stochastic matrix solution is refined towards a quasi-permutation matrix to enable rounding.

- Node alignment: The end solution provides a mapping of nodes across the two input graphs, explaining the edit path.

- Accuracy: The method ranks among top performers across benchmarks and beats neural approaches.

- Efficiency: Avoids expensive ground truth generation and model training, while achieving competitive accuracy.

- Scalability: Demonstrated superior performance on larger graphs compared to neural baselines.

In summary, the key ideas are around an unsupervised, explainable, and scalable approximation of graph edit distance through a convex relaxation technique.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper establishes a connection between unrestricted graph alignment and graph edit distance (GED) by showing that squared chemical distance is an instance of GED. Can you explain this proof and its implications in more detail? 

2. The paper formulates a mildly constrained version of GED (Mc-GED) and provides a closed form expression for it using modified chemical distance. Walk through the details of this formulation and discuss any assumptions made.

3. Explain the relaxation of the optimization problem to approximate Mc-GED over the space of doubly stochastic matrices instead of permutation matrices. What is the rationale behind this relaxation?

4. The paper uses a modified Adam algorithm (M-Adam) to optimize the relaxed problem. Explain how M-Adam works to guide the solution towards a quasi-permutation matrix. What convergence guarantees does it provide?

5. The paper uses two rounding algorithms - greedy and Hungarian - to convert the quasi-permutation matrix to a permutation matrix. Compare and contrast these algorithms and discuss their tradeoffs. 

6. One of the major claims of the paper is interpretability of the GED approximation and edit path generation. Walk through how the method achieves this in detail.

7. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms neural baselines on larger graphs. Analyze the reasons behind this superior performance on larger graphs.

8. The paper discusses lack of generalizability of neural methods across datasets. Explain what causes this issue and how the proposed method addresses it.

9. An ablation study is presented that compares the performance with and without refining the solution towards a quasi-permutation matrix. Analyze this result and its implications on the method's design.

10. The paper focuses on approximating GED in an unsupervised manner. Can you think of any extensions or modifications to the method that could incorporate supervised learning? What benefits or drawbacks might this have?
