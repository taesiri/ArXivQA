# [The Tactician's Web of Large-Scale Formal Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Formal verification of mathematical theorems using proof assistants like Coq requires manually creating proof terms, which is tedious and time-consuming. There is a need for automation to assist in this process.
- Existing machine learning models for automating theorem proving in Coq have limitations in how they interface with Coq and represent mathematical knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- Represents Coq's internal formal knowledge (Gallina terms, proofs, tactics) as a large semantic graph that makes implicit information explicit.
- Supports extracting this graph as a dataset, as well as interfacing directly with a running Coq process through "prediction servers" and "proving clients".
- Dataset contains over 250 million nodes encoding 520k definitions and 4.6 million proof transitions extracted from 120 Coq packages.
- Prediction servers suggest tactics for a given proof state. Can be accessed in Coq through Tactician plugin.
- Proving clients autonomously explore proof search space by executing tactics and observing results.
- Includes framework for massively parallel benchmarking of proving agents.

Main Contributions:
- Novel semantic graph representation of Coq's Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
- Representations of tactic-based proofs as sequences of proof steps manipulating graph-based proof states. 
- Communication protocols and datasets for interfacing machine learning models with Coq.
- Tactician plugin for tight integration of prediction servers and proving clients into Coq.
- Massively scalable framework for benchmarking proving agents.
- Enables creating agents that help with theorem proving in Coq and learning representations of formal mathematics.

The paper aims to provide a platform to bring machine learning and formal verification closer together, by enabling convenient experimentation and practical integration of learning agents into Coq.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a platform for interacting with the Coq proof assistant to extract graph and text representations of formal proofs and mathematical definitions, enabling machine learning models to analyze Coq developments and directly interface with Coq to assist in proving theorems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a platform for interacting with and extracting graph-based and text-based data from Coq during the compilation of mathematical theories. The key aspects include:

- A novel graph-based representation of Coq's Calculus of Inductive Constructions that faithfully captures the semantics of terms, definitions, proofs, and the global context. This representation supports bisimulation-based sharing of identical subterms.

- Representations of tactic-based proofs that can be decomposed into atomic steps and anonymized to become name-invariant. This allows tactics to be interpreted in the context of graph-based proof states.

- Modes of interaction with Coq for machine learning including offline datasets, prediction servers that suggest tactics, and proving clients that autonomously explore proofs. These facilitate developing and evaluating ML models.

- A massively parallel benchmarking framework to assess proving agents on a large corpus of Coq developments.

In summary, the platform enables extracting, interacting with, and evaluating mathematical knowledge from Coq in formats amenable for machine learning research. The integration with Coq also allows ML agents to be readily used by proof engineers.

The paper discusses representing the Calculus of Inductive Constructions used in the Coq proof assistant as a graph structure for machine learning purposes. Key aspects include encoding terms, definitions, proofs, tactics, tactic scripts, and the global context into an interconnected graph. The graph structure aims to explicitly represent information that would normally remain implicit in textual communication. Datasets extracted from Coq packages are provided based on these graph representations to facilitate machine learning research. The paper also introduces different modes of interacting with Coq for agents, including prediction servers, proving clients, and benchmarking. Experiments evaluate graph sharing, faithfulness of representations, and performance of neural models. So in summary, key terms span representation learning, interacting with Coq, and using the acquired data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes representing the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC) as a graph. What were some of the key design decisions and tradeoffs made when translating CIC terms into graphs? For example, how was the choice made to collapse the type hierarchy or make the translation name-invariant?

2. The paper argues that the graph representation is theoretically the most optimal for machine learning purposes compared to text or abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, what are some of the practical disadvantages or limitations of using a graph representation over text?

3. When defining the bisimulation equivalence relation between graph representations of terms, what complications arise from needing to respect Î±-equivalence of binders? How does the use of back-edges in the variable gadget help address this?

4. The paper describes a complex process for decomposing tactic expressions into atomic tactics to create valid proof trees. What assumptions need to be made about the semantics of tactics and the tactic engine for this decomposition process to work properly? When might these assumptions be violated?  

5. How does the meta-graph structure track the evolution of the global context over time and handle complications introduced by Coq's section and module system? What risks does this introduce for machine learning when creating train/test splits?

6. The identity hash is used to enable sharing of bisimilar graph fragments. What use cases does the paper propose for exploiting this identity information? How might an agent take advantage of a shared graph representation?

7. What are some of the limitations of only extracting kernel-level terms and not fully representing extra-kernel features like implicit arguments or type classes? How might this affect agents trained on the data?

8. For representing tactical proofs, what tradeoffs were made in the level of fidelity of the representation? What behaviors of the tactic language Ltac are not faithfully captured? 

9. The paper decomposes complex tactic expressions into atomic pieces under certain assumptions. What risks are introduced by this tactic decomposition in terms of properly representing the original proof script semantics?

10. When providing the text representations of proofs and definitions, choices have to be made regarding Coq's printing settings. What impact might this have on text-based agents? How robust will agents be to variations in printing?
