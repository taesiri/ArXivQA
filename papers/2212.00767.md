# [Exploiting Proximity-Aware Tasks for Embodied Social Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00767)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we design navigation policies for embodied agents that can safely and efficiently navigate environments with moving humans?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Explicitly modeling human-agent interactions and proximity through auxiliary "proximity-aware" tasks can help agents learn socially-compliant navigation behaviors. 

2) Combining proximity-modeling with general purpose self-supervised tasks can further improve navigation performance.

3) Fine-grained analysis of agent-human encounters during navigation can provide insights into the social capabilities learned by different models.

The authors propose proximity-aware tasks to model the risk of collision and proximity of humans, a new encounter-based evaluation protocol, and show improved navigation performance and social behavior compared to prior methods.

In summary, the paper explores how to inject social awareness into navigation agents through multi-task learning, and analyzes the resulting policies through a novel encounter-centric evaluation scheme. The key insight is that explicitly modeling human proximity and interactions is crucial for safe, efficient social navigation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new architecture for embodied social navigation that uses Proximity-Aware Tasks to model the present and future danger for the agent's actions. The two tasks introduced are Risk Estimation and Proximity Compass.

2. An encounter-based evaluation protocol to analyze social navigation models in a more fine-grained way. Encounters between the agent and humans are classified into 4 types (frontal, intersection, blind corner, person following), and metrics are proposed to evaluate different aspects of these encounter types. 

3. A new dataset called HM3D-S that provides episodes for training and testing embodied social navigation agents. The dataset is built on top of HM3D.

In summary, the key ideas presented are:

- Using Proximity-Aware Tasks to inject social behavior and human awareness into a reinforcement learning navigation policy. 

- Evaluating social navigation not just with overall metrics but also by looking at specific types of agent-human encounters.

- Providing a new dataset tailored for the social navigation task.

The proposed model and evaluation protocol are validated through experiments on the Gibson4+ and HM3D-S datasets. The results show that the Proximity-Aware Tasks help avoid collisions and lead to smoother agent trajectories during human encounters.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a model for embodied social navigation that uses proximity-aware tasks to encode human-agent interactions and common-sense social behaviors, as well as a new encounter-based evaluation protocol and dataset to analyze performance on human-agent interactions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to prior work in embodied AI for social navigation:

- The paper focuses on social navigation in large-scale photorealistic indoor environments using only egocentric RGB-D input. This is in contrast to some prior work that uses simplified gridworld environments or relies on full map knowledge during test time.

- The proposed model incorporates novel "proximity-aware tasks" that encode social behavior into the navigation policy, unlike prior work that uses more generic multi-agent collision avoidance techniques.  

- The paper proposes a new fine-grained evaluation protocol based on agent-pedestrian encounter analysis. This provides more nuanced metrics compared to commonly used overall success rate or collisions. 

- The model is trained and evaluated on two large-scale datasets - Gibson4+ and HM3D-S. Using such realistic datasets advances the field beyond smaller toy datasets.

- Compared to prior learning-based methods like CADRL, this work does not assume collaboration between agents and focuses more on reactive navigation in social settings.

- The model combines self-supervised auxiliary tasks with proximity-aware tasks, showing benefits over just using one type of task. This demonstrates the utility of multi-task learning.

- Unlike some prior work that uses imitation learning, this paper trains agents with reinforcement learning which allows optimizing the reward tradeoffs directly.

Overall, the key novelties are the proximal-aware tasks for encoding social behavior, the encounter-based evaluation protocol, and the experiments on large-scale photorealistic indoor environments. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the SocialNav task.
