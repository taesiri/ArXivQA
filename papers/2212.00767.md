# [Exploiting Proximity-Aware Tasks for Embodied Social Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00767)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we design navigation policies for embodied agents that can safely and efficiently navigate environments with moving humans?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Explicitly modeling human-agent interactions and proximity through auxiliary "proximity-aware" tasks can help agents learn socially-compliant navigation behaviors. 

2) Combining proximity-modeling with general purpose self-supervised tasks can further improve navigation performance.

3) Fine-grained analysis of agent-human encounters during navigation can provide insights into the social capabilities learned by different models.

The authors propose proximity-aware tasks to model the risk of collision and proximity of humans, a new encounter-based evaluation protocol, and show improved navigation performance and social behavior compared to prior methods.

In summary, the paper explores how to inject social awareness into navigation agents through multi-task learning, and analyzes the resulting policies through a novel encounter-centric evaluation scheme. The key insight is that explicitly modeling human proximity and interactions is crucial for safe, efficient social navigation.
