# [Exploiting Proximity-Aware Tasks for Embodied Social Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00767)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we design navigation policies for embodied agents that can safely and efficiently navigate environments with moving humans?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Explicitly modeling human-agent interactions and proximity through auxiliary "proximity-aware" tasks can help agents learn socially-compliant navigation behaviors. 

2) Combining proximity-modeling with general purpose self-supervised tasks can further improve navigation performance.

3) Fine-grained analysis of agent-human encounters during navigation can provide insights into the social capabilities learned by different models.

The authors propose proximity-aware tasks to model the risk of collision and proximity of humans, a new encounter-based evaluation protocol, and show improved navigation performance and social behavior compared to prior methods.

In summary, the paper explores how to inject social awareness into navigation agents through multi-task learning, and analyzes the resulting policies through a novel encounter-centric evaluation scheme. The key insight is that explicitly modeling human proximity and interactions is crucial for safe, efficient social navigation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new architecture for embodied social navigation that uses Proximity-Aware Tasks to model the present and future danger for the agent's actions. The two tasks introduced are Risk Estimation and Proximity Compass.

2. An encounter-based evaluation protocol to analyze social navigation models in a more fine-grained way. Encounters between the agent and humans are classified into 4 types (frontal, intersection, blind corner, person following), and metrics are proposed to evaluate different aspects of these encounter types. 

3. A new dataset called HM3D-S that provides episodes for training and testing embodied social navigation agents. The dataset is built on top of HM3D.

In summary, the key ideas presented are:

- Using Proximity-Aware Tasks to inject social behavior and human awareness into a reinforcement learning navigation policy. 

- Evaluating social navigation not just with overall metrics but also by looking at specific types of agent-human encounters.

- Providing a new dataset tailored for the social navigation task.

The proposed model and evaluation protocol are validated through experiments on the Gibson4+ and HM3D-S datasets. The results show that the Proximity-Aware Tasks help avoid collisions and lead to smoother agent trajectories during human encounters.
