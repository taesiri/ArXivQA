# [Hybrid Square Neural ODE Causal Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17233)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Hybrid$^2$ Neural ODE Causal Modeling":

Problem:
- Hybrid models combine mechanistic ODE models with flexible neural networks to provide interpretability and causal grounding while improving model flexibility. However, as hybrid models become more flexible, they can lose the causal validity provided by the mechanistic model.
- The authors demonstrate this through experiments on modeling glucose dynamics during exercise for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). More flexible hybrid models achieve better predictive performance but perform worse at selecting the intervention with the largest treatment effect among counterfactual simulations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a hybrid^2 approach that uses a hybrid loss function combining:
  - Predictive loss to measure prediction error
  - Causal loss based on classifying the ordering of treatment effects, even if precise effects are unknown
- This loss biases learning towards causally valid hybrid models, even as model flexibility increases

Key Contributions:
- Definition of a spectrum of hybrid modeling approaches from pure mechanistic to pure blackbox
- Introduction of a hybrid^2 framework with a hybrid loss function combining predictive and causal losses
- Demonstration that tuning the hybrid loss leads to a "win-win" with good predictive performance and causal validity
- State-of-the-art glucose prediction during exercise for individuals with T1D, while retaining the ability to correctly rank counterfactual interventions
- Potentially widely applicable technique to maintain interpretability and causal validity in flexible hybrid machine learning models

The key insight is that while precise treatment effects are often unknown, qualitative knowledge about the relative ordering of effects can be encoded into a causal loss. This guides the learning towards causally coherent hybrid models, achieving both flexibility and validity.
