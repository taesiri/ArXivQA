# [Reliable, Adaptable, and Attributable Language Models with Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Parametric language models like GPT still suffer from major weaknesses including factual errors, difficulty verifying outputs, inability to opt out problematic training data, expensive adaptation, and massive model sizes. 
- Simply scaling up models does not sufficiently address these weaknesses.

Proposed Solution: 
- Advocate for retrieval-augmented language models (combine a retriever and parametric LM) to replace parametric LMs as next generation of LMs. 
- Retrieval-augmented LMs query a datastore at inference time to retrieve relevant text, reducing reliance on internalized knowledge. This makes them more reliable, adaptable, and attributable.

Current Limitations Hindering Adoption:
- Struggle to leverage helpful text beyond narrowly defined relevance.
- Shallow interaction between retriever and LM components via simple input augmentation.  
- Lack infrastructure for efficient large-scale training and inference.

Key Contributions:
- Identify weaknesses of parametric LMs and benefits of retrieval augmentation.
- Propose roadmap to advance retrieval-augmented LMs:
   - Reconsider relevance definitions and improve datastores
   - Architectures enabling deeper retriever-LM interactions
   - Standardized libraries and infrastructure for scaling
- Call for collaborative efforts across areas like systems, hardware, and algorithms to realize the potential of retrieval-augmented LMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper advocates for retrieval-augmented language models, which incorporate large-scale external text datastores during inference, as the next generation of language models to address key limitations of parametric language models regarding reliability, adaptability, and attributability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this position paper is to advocate for retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) to replace parametric LMs as the next generation of LMs. Specifically, it:

1) Highlights the limitations of current parametric LMs, including factual inaccuracies, difficulty of verification and opting out problematic sequences, expensive adaptation costs, and prohibitively large model sizes. 

2) Discusses how retrieval-augmented LMs can address many of these weaknesses through incorporating external datastores, leading to improved reliability, adaptability, and attributability.

3) Identifies current challenges hindering the wider adoption of retrieval-augmented LMs: relying only on semantic/lexical similarity for retrieval, limited interaction between retrieval and LM components, and lack of infrastructure for efficient training and inference at scale.

4) Proposes a roadmap to advance retrieval-augmented LMs to overcome these challenges, including: (i) reconsidering the notion of relevance and building better datastores, (ii) exploring architectures and training methodologies for tighter retriever-LM interactions, and (iii) developing standardized libraries and infrastructure for scaling.

In summary, the paper makes a case for why retrieval-augmented LMs hold promise as the next generation of LMs, while outlining specific research avenues to address their current limitations for broader adoption. The key contribution is the analysis and comprehensive roadmap aimed at fundamentally advancing retrieval-augmented LMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Retrieval-augmented language models: Language models that incorporate retrieval of external text from a datastore at inference time. The main focus of the paper.

- Parametric language models: Traditional language models that encode all knowledge in their parameters. The paper discusses limitations of these models.  

- Datastore: The external collection of documents that retrieval-augmented language models retrieve information from during inference.

- Knowledge-intensive tasks: Tasks like question answering where models need to leverage factual knowledge. Retrieval augmentation has shown promise on these tasks. 

- Hallucinations/factual errors: One weakness of parametric LMs is their propensity to generate factually incorrect statements not grounded in the training data.

- Adaptability: Retrieval-augmented LMs can more easily adapt to new domains or data distributions by updating the datastore, without retraining.

- Attributions: Retrieval-augmented LMs provide documents used during inference, enabling better verification of outputs.

- Relevance: The paper advocates moving beyond semantic similarity to find helpful external text for broader applications. 

- Architecture: Such as input augmentation, intermediate fusion, output interpolation.

- Training methodologies: Like independent training, sequential training, joint training.

- Infrastructure and scaling: Such as challenges of updating indexes during training, storing billions of embeddings, etc.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper advocates for advancing retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) to address the limitations of parametric LMs. What specific limitations of parametric LMs do the authors identify as most critical to address? How do retrieval-augmented LMs help mitigate those weaknesses?

2. The authors propose going "beyond semantic and lexical similarity" when defining relevance between a query and documents in the datastore. What new notions of relevance do you think should be explored to make retrieval more effective for diverse tasks? 

3. The paper discusses challenges with scaling the datastore to trillions of tokens. What specific algorithmic improvements or infrastructure developments could enable efficient storage and retrieval from such massive datastores?

4. What are some promising approaches mentioned in the paper for ensuring tighter integration and interaction between the retriever and LM components? How can we move beyond simplistic input augmentation? 

5. The authors argue for more standardized implementations and benchmarks for retrieval-augmented LMs. What key functionalities should such an open-source library support? What evaluation benchmarks would be most valuable?

6. How can we best leverage complementary strengths of retrieval and parametric components within a single model architecture while minimizing redundancy? What are some recent promising architectures in this direction?

7. The paper advocates investment into specialized hardware for retrieval-augmented LMs. What specific computational bottlenecks motivate this? How might future hardware innovations be tailored to such models?

8. What training methodologies beyond independent, sequential, and joint training should be explored for retrieval-augmented LMs? How can we optimize end-to-end training efficiency?  

9. How can retrieval-augmented LMs be adapted to non-English, multilingual scenarios? What challenges need to be addressed to handle multiple languages?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on text-based retrieval-augmented LMs. How could retrieval over images, videos, speech, etc. augment multimodal generative models? What new challenges arise in multimodal retrieval?
