# [LiFT: Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Models as   Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08958)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new unsupervised reinforcement learning framework called LiFT (unsupervised Learning with Foundation models as Teachers) that leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to guide an agent's training without any human supervision. Specifically, the LLMs propose meaningful task instructions grounded in the current environment, while the VLMs provide reward feedback indicating how well the agent completed the task. Experiments in the challenging, open-ended MineDojo environment demonstrate that agents trained with LiFT successfully acquire more semantically meaningful skills compared to prior unsupervised RL techniques. Further analysis reveals limitations in the quality of the VLM-provided rewards, suggesting avenues for future work in improving VLMs for more fine-grained understanding and feedback. Overall, the paper introduces a novel closed-loop unsupervised RL system utilizing foundation models and highlights remaining challenges in scaling such an approach.
