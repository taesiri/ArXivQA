# [LiFT: Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Models as   Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08958)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new unsupervised reinforcement learning framework called LiFT (unsupervised Learning with Foundation models as Teachers) that leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to guide an agent's training without any human supervision. Specifically, the LLMs propose meaningful task instructions grounded in the current environment, while the VLMs provide reward feedback indicating how well the agent completed the task. Experiments in the challenging, open-ended MineDojo environment demonstrate that agents trained with LiFT successfully acquire more semantically meaningful skills compared to prior unsupervised RL techniques. Further analysis reveals limitations in the quality of the VLM-provided rewards, suggesting avenues for future work in improving VLMs for more fine-grained understanding and feedback. Overall, the paper introduces a novel closed-loop unsupervised RL system utilizing foundation models and highlights remaining challenges in scaling such an approach.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Training general reinforcement learning (RL) agents that can perform a variety of helpful tasks in many environments requires costly human supervision in the form of demonstrations or reward engineering. 
- Unsupervised RL methods attempt to mitigate this by optimizing for behavior diversity, but the learned skills often lack semantic meaningfulness as the diversity metrics don't induce meaningful behaviors.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes LiFT (unsupervised Learning with Foundation models as Teachers), a framework that leverages foundation models (FMs) to guide an RL agent towards learning semantically meaningful behaviors without any human supervision.

- It uses a large language model (LLM) to propose grounded, meaningful task instructions given the objects in the environment. A vision-language model (VLM) then provides reward feedback to the agent as it attempts to follow the instructions.

- Specifically, the LLM proposes instructions like "milk a cow" if there is a cow entity present. The VLM reward is based on the similarity between the instruction text and videos of the agent's behavior. Reward stabilization techniques are used to reduce noise.

Main Contributions:

- The LiFT framework that can acquire meaningful visuomotor skills in a challenging, open-ended environment without any human supervision over tasks or rewards.

- Experiments showing LiFT agents learn meaningful skills in MineDojo that prior unsupervised RL methods fail to, and performs comparably to using human annotated instructions.

- Analysis highlighting limitations of current VLMs for precise reward computation, and strategies like policy initialization and reward post-processing to alleviate issues.

- The paper supports the promise of using foundation models to guide unsupervised RL agents, while pointing out VLM limitations that compel future work to enable more scalable and capable learning.
