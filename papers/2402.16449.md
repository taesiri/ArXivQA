# [Online Efficient Safety-Critical Control for Mobile Robots in Unknown   Dynamic Multi-Obstacle Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ensuring safe and efficient navigation for mobile robots in unknown dynamic environments with multiple obstacles is challenging. 
- Existing methods using control barrier functions (CBFs) struggle with:
   - Constructing CBFs online when obstacle quantities/states are unknown
   - Increased computation time as number of obstacles grows due to formulating multiple CBFs

Proposed Solution:
- A goal-seeking and exploration framework using LiDAR for local perception
- Local perception:
   - Clusters point clouds to identify obstacles, encapsulates them as minimum bounding ellipses (MBEs)
   - Differentiates static vs dynamic obstacles by comparing current and previous MBE states
   - Predicts dynamic obstacle movements using Kalman Filter
   - Constructs CBFs or D-CBFs for each MBE
- Introduces buffer zones around each MBE to evolve D-CBFs into Type-II D-CBFs
   - Activates D-CBF only when system state enters buffer zone
   - Allows system to prioritize safety in "exploration mode" when in buffer zone
- Combines benefits of model predictive control (MPC) in "goal-seeking mode" and control Lyapunov function (CLF)
- Ensures safety and asymptotic stabilization to goal location

Main Contributions:
- Online perception to construct D-CBFs without knowing obstacle quantities/states
- Buffer zones to reduce number of active D-CBFs, lowering computation time
- New goal-seeking and exploration framework that ensures safety and goal convergence
- Validation in simulations and real-world experiments showing efficiency for navigation in dynamic environments
