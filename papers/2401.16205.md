# [CognitiveOS: Large Multimodal Model based System to Endow Any Type of   Robot with Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing cognitive abilities for robots is challenging, especially understanding and processing the external world. Prior attempts using only text struggled with ambiguities and assumptions of static environments.
- There is a need for a system that can generalize cognitive skills and knowledge across diverse robotic platforms without needing full retraining for each robot type. This allows equipping industrial/service robots with cognition efficiently.

Proposed Solution: 
- CognitiveOS - a multi-model transformer-based system with 3 key modules:
   1) Behavior Generation: Selects optimal actions for task execution using Mistral 7B model
   2) Visual Information Analysis: Understands environment via CogAgent VLM (describe, question, search images)
   3) Long-Term Memory: Stores vector embeddings of useful information to supplement tasks

- Robot actions are standardized across platforms. The system is tested on physical (manipulator, quadruped) and virtual robots.

Key Contributions:
- First system to generalize cognitive skills across robotic platforms without full retraining. Reduces data needs.
- System adapts even to unseen robot configurations using simulated action outcomes.
- Evaluation shows higher reasoning ability than prior works, even for unseen robots.
- Enables collaborative task execution across diverse robots via communication abilities.
- Can be deployed as standardized server-based solution for industrial/service robots.

In summary, CognitiveOS pioneers cross-platform cognitive skill generalization for robots by combining language, visual and memory models within a modular architecture. Evaluations demonstrate versatile reasoning and collaboration potential across physical and virtual robots.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CognitiveOS, a system leveraging multiple transformer-based models to provide cognitive abilities for robots of various types, enabling generalization of skills and knowledge across platforms without additional tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of CognitiveOS, a system that can endow robots of various types with cognitive abilities without needing additional tuning for each platform. Specifically:

- CognitiveOS is the first system designed to provide cognitive capabilities across diverse robotic platforms, allowing skills and knowledge to generalize across different robots. This eliminates the need to develop a separate cognitive system from scratch for each robot type.

- The system is comprised of multiple transformer-based models, including a behavior generation module, a visual information analysis module, and a long-term memory module. Together, these modules allow the robot to understand tasks, analyze its environment, access relevant memories, and determine appropriate actions.

- CognitiveOS was tested on various physical platforms (quadruped robots, manipulator robots) as well as virtual robots not present in the training set. Results showed effective generalization even to unseen platforms, with especially high performance in reasoning tasks critical to cognition.

- The system supports robot-robot collaboration on tasks, allowing different robot types equipped with CognitiveOS to communicate and cooperate. Standardization of the system facilitates deployment across diverse robots in enterprise settings.

In summary, the key contribution is the development and demonstration of a unified, server-based cognitive system that can work across robotic platforms to provide advanced cognitive capabilities without needing custom tuning. This carries significance for industrial and service robotics applications.
