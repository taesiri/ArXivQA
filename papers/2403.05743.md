# [Generative Probabilistic Forecasting with Applications in Market   Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Probabilistic forecasting estimates the conditional probabilistic distribution of future time series based on past observations. It is critical for risk-based decision making in power systems operations due to increased variability and extreme events. Mainstream techniques have limitations - parametric methods lose accuracy due to model mismatch while nonparametric methods face computational and statistical challenges. Recently, generative probabilistic forecasting (GPF) methods using deep learning avoid these issues but lack theoretical justification and comparative validation on real-world data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel GPF architecture called WIAE-GPF based on the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of time series. It includes:

1) An autoencoder neural network that transforms nonparametric multivariate random processes into canonical innovation sequences that are IID uniform. 

2) A sampling method to generate future time series realizations from their conditional probability distribution based on past observations and the innovation sequence.

3) A novel deep learning algorithm to train the autoencoder that enforces the innovation sequence to match input-output conditional distributions.

Theoretical Contributions:
1) Prove innovation sequence is Bayesian sufficient for forecasting so using it incurs no loss.

2) Prove validity of WIAE-GPF by showing generated samples have true conditional distribution.

3) Establish structural convergence property - as autoencoder dimension increases, conditional distribution of WIAE-GPF outputs converges to true conditional distribution.

Experimental Contributions:
1) Apply WIAE-GPF to highly dynamic/volatile real-time market signals - LMP, LMP spreads, and ACE.

2) Extensive comparison with leading traditional and machine learning forecasters using actual NYISO and PJM market data.

3) Demonstrate superior performance of WIAE-GPF against state-of-the-art techniques under both probabilistic and point forecast metrics.
