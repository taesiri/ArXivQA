# [Analyzing the Influence of Fake News in the 2024 Elections: A   Comprehensive Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03750)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the critical issue of "fake news" - misinformation or disinformation presented as factual news stories. Specifically, it focuses on racial slurs and biases in US political speeches and discourse. Fake news can manipulate public opinion and influence democratic processes like elections. However, there is a lack of comprehensive datasets to help researchers analyze and develop solutions to combat fake news.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a meticulously curated dataset focused on identifying fake news based on racial biases in US political speeches. The key aspects include:

- Scraping ~40,000 news articles over 6 months using relevant keywords spanning topics like race, politics, climate etc.

- Carefully annotating and labeling a subset of 4,000 articles using a combination of OpenAI's NLP and manual human verification to capture various dimensions like types of biases, targeted groups etc.

- The final dataset has details like article text, publication date, source URL, labels etc. Formatted as CSV for easy usage.

Main Contributions:  
- Comprehensive labeled dataset specifically targeted at studying racial bias and fake news in US politics to advance research.

- Detailed methodology for collecting diverse news articles and annotating them based on multiple facets of bias using state-of-the-art NLP tools combined with human oversight.

- Benchmarking strategies and a range of applications in bias detection, linguistic analysis, journalism etc. demonstrating the dataset's value.

Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution by developing a much-needed, rigorously compiled dataset to promote research into detection and mitigation of fake news and bias in political discourse.
