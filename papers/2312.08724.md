# [Personalized Path Recourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08724)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Personalized Path Recourse (PPR), a novel method to generate alternative sequences of actions (recourse paths) for an agent that can lead to improved outcomes compared to the agent's original path. The key goal is to ensure the recourse path respects three crucial properties: (1) achieving a predetermined goal (e.g. higher reward); (2) maintaining similarity to the original path; and (3) exhibiting personalization to the agent's behavioral patterns based on their policy function. Personalization refers to tailoring the recourse path to the agent's tendencies and preferences reflected in their policy. The method trains a separate recourse agent using shaped rewards that account for satisfying the goal, path similarity, and personalization. Experiments across reinforcement learning and supervised learning settings on sequential decisions and time series/text data showcase PPR's ability to produce more personalized recourse paths over baselines while still achieving the specified goal. Key limitations are PPR's reliance on discrete states and actions and needing the availability of the agent's policy. Future work involves expanding PPR to handle continuous states and actions and efficiently learning an agent's policy from limited data. Overall, PPR has promising applications in areas like personalized recommendations and sequence data modification.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Personalized Path Recourse":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of generating alternative paths of actions (recourse paths) for an agent that can lead to better outcomes compared to the agent's original path, while ensuring the new path is personalized to the agent's behavior and similar to the original path. 

For example, for a student who originally pursued a career path that didn't lead to a high salary, the goal is to generate an alternative career path that could have potentially led to a higher salary, while making sure the new path aligns with the student's interests and capabilities and does not deviate too much from the original path.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel method called Personalized Path Recourse (PPR) to generate such personalized recourse paths. The key ideas are:

1) Design a reward function that encourages paths to achieve the desired goal, be personalized to the agent based on their policy, and be similar to the original path.

2) Train a personalized recourse agent using deep Q-learning to generate paths that maximize this reward.

3) Incorporate an exploration strategy to guide the agent to efficiently search for good paths.

The method can work for both reinforcement learning (where the agent's policy is known) and supervised learning (where the policy is a generator model trained on sequence data).

Main Contributions:
- Novel goal of generating complete alternative paths of actions (rather than explaining individual actions) to improve outcomes for an agent in a personalized way.

- New method PPR to solve this using deep reinforcement learning combined with tailored reward shaping and exploration techniques. 

- Demonstrated the approach in a variety of settings - grid worlds, sequence data like temperature and text, showing enhanced personalization and goal achievement over baselines.

- Discussed how the framework can be adapted to both reinforcement learning and supervised learning scenarios involving sequence decisions and data.

In summary, the paper presents a new perspective to recourse focusing on agent-centric alternative paths, and provides an effective approach to realize this vision in different contexts. The results showcase improved personalization for generating recourse sequences.
