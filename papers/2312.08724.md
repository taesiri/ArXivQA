## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Personalized Path Recourse (PPR), a novel method to generate alternative sequences of actions (recourse paths) for an agent that can lead to improved outcomes compared to the agent's original path. The key goal is to ensure the recourse path respects three crucial properties: (1) achieving a predetermined goal (e.g. higher reward); (2) maintaining similarity to the original path; and (3) exhibiting personalization to the agent's behavioral patterns based on their policy function. Personalization refers to tailoring the recourse path to the agent's tendencies and preferences reflected in their policy. The method trains a separate recourse agent using shaped rewards that account for satisfying the goal, path similarity, and personalization. Experiments across reinforcement learning and supervised learning settings on sequential decisions and time series/text data showcase PPR's ability to produce more personalized recourse paths over baselines while still achieving the specified goal. Key limitations are PPR's reliance on discrete states and actions and needing the availability of the agent's policy. Future work involves expanding PPR to handle continuous states and actions and efficiently learning an agent's policy from limited data. Overall, PPR has promising applications in areas like personalized recommendations and sequence data modification.
