# [Teacher-Student Learning on Complexity in Intelligent Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15665)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- E-commerce companies receive a large volume of customer service requests daily, with each contact taking significant time to resolve (10-15 mins). 
- Effectively routing customers to appropriate agents based on request complexity is crucial for good customer experience and business success. 
- However, defining "complexity" is challenging and subjective. Consensus labeling by agents to create training data is expensive and slow.

Proposed Solution:
- A teacher-student learning framework to predict contact complexity and route customers accordingly.
- Teacher model scores complexity based on post-contact transcripts using length, uncertainty and required skillfulness.
- Teacher predictions used to label data to train student model that predicts complexity pre-contact using customer data.
- Experiment shows routing high complexity contacts to senior agents reduces transfers, handle times etc.

Key Contributions:
- Public dataset of 500K customer-agent transcript conversations.
- Mathematical framework to characterize contact complexity using transcript properties.
- Teacher-student framework for intelligent routing without expensive labeling.
- Definition and demonstration of "Complexity AUC" metric to evaluate routing system effectiveness.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative teacher-student learning approach along with useful complexity metrics to effectively route customer contacts in e-commerce businesses. This has the potential to significantly improve customer experience and service efficiency.
