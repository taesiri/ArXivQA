# [Leveraging Large Language Models to Power Chatbots for Collecting User   Self-Reported Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05843)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can Large Language Models (LLMs) be leveraged to power chatbots that can effectively engage users and collect self-reported data through natural conversations?

The authors investigate different factors in designing prompts for LLMs to steer chatbots, such as information specification format (structured vs. descriptive) and personality modifier (with vs. without), in order to understand how these factors impact the chatbots' ability to carry on natural dialogues while reliably collecting user-provided information.

The key hypothesis appears to be that by properly designing prompts for LLMs, it is possible to create chatbots that can not only ask questions to gather specified information from users, but also exhibit social attributes and conversational abilities like empathy, follow-up questions, error recovery, etc. 

The authors evaluate this through an online user study where participants converse with LLM-powered chatbots to provide self-reports on topics like sleep, food, work and exercise. The results provide insights into effective prompt engineering and showcase the feasibility of using LLMs to bootstrap chatbots for robust user data collection.

In summary, the central research question is about exploring prompt designs for LLMs that enable chatbots to naturally converse with people to elicit self-reported information. The hypothesis is that with proper prompt engineering, LLM-powered chatbots can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to power chatbots that can have natural conversations with people to collect self-reported data on health topics. The authors built chatbots for 4 topics - sleep, food, work, and exercise - and evaluated them in an online study with 48 participants. The results showed the chatbots were able to cover 79% of desired information slots on average solely through zero-shot prompting, without any fine-tuning.

2. The paper examines how different prompt design factors impact the slot filling performance and conversational behaviors of the LLM-powered chatbots. Specifically, it assessed two factors - information specification format (structured vs descriptive) and personality modifier. The results provide insights into how to design effective prompts for steering chatbot behaviors. For example, structured formats led to more direct required questions whereas descriptive formats enabled more follow-up questions.  

3. The paper analyzes the types of conversational behaviors exhibited by the chatbots, including essential dialogue acts, empathetic responses, and problematic turns. This analysis sheds light on the abilities and limitations of LLMs in powering chatbots. Notably, the chatbots showed abilities in social behaviors like appreciating users' accomplishments and sympathizing with negative outcomes. 

4. The paper discusses opportunities provided by LLMs in easily creating chatbots with domain knowledge and social attributes as well as limitations like repetitiveness and randomness. It also offers suggestions for improving LLM-driven chatbots, such as using filters and slowing down response times.

5. The implications from this work can inform future research in leveraging LLMs for building chatbots for personalized data collection through natural conversations. The insights on prompt design can also enable non-experts to more easily build their own LLMs-powered chatbots.

In summary, the main contribution is providing empirical evidence and insights into using LLMs to power chatbots for natural data collection conversations, which can facilitate self-tracking applications. The analysis of prompt designs and chatbot behaviors also offers a starting point for future research to build more robust LLM-driven chatbots.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper explores using large language models like GPT-3 to power chatbots for collecting self-reported user data through natural conversations, evaluating different prompt designs and finding the chatbots can cover most desired topics but still exhibit some erroneous behaviors inherent to large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of using large language models (LLMs) to power chatbots:

- The focus on designing prompts to steer chatbots for collecting user self-reported data is quite novel. Most prior work using LLMs for chatbots has focused on open-domain social chatbots or goal-oriented assistants. This paper explores a new application area of health monitoring through natural conversations.

- The empirical evaluation through an online user study is a strength compared to some other papers that only conduct offline evaluations or demonstrations. The analysis of hundreds of real user-chatbot dialogues provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for this purpose. 

- The examination of different prompt design factors like persona, slot specification formats etc. is thorough compared to other work that usually only tries one approach. The paper provides a useful starting point for prompting methodology when using LLMs to make chatbots.

- The sample size of 48 participants is reasonably good for an online study with qualitative analysis. Many similar studies have less than 30 participants. Though larger samples could reveal more insights.

- The conversations are relatively short (avg 20 turns) compared to studies testing social chatbots or companions over longer term interactions. Long term usage may reveal different challenges.

- The paper focuses on subjective and conversational analysis more than objective task success metrics like slot filling accuracy. Some healthcare applications may demand rigorous accuracy requirements.

- The implications are specifically drawn for chatbots to collect personal health data. Findings may not generalize fully to chatbots for other domains like customer service though many insights still apply.

Overall, I think this is a novel contribution as one of the first attempts to design and evaluate LLM-driven chatbots for self-report data collection. The analysis provides useful insights and a good starting point for future work compared to other LLM chatbot papers. More rigorous evaluation on additional factors and metrics would strengthen it further.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate ways to improve the performance of LLM-driven chatbots, such as augmenting the prompts with few-shot learning by providing example dialogues. This may make the chatbots more robust in question-asking abilities and handling negative conversation paths.

- Explore the effects of different parameters for controlling randomness in LLM generations (e.g. temperature, frequency penalties) to provide guidance for developing better and more robust chatbots.

- Test chatbots powered by other LLMs besides GPT-3 used in this study, using the prompts proposed here as a starting point. Different LLMs may yield different performance due to variations in training data and model architectures.

- Evaluate user perceptions of LLM-driven chatbots, especially voice-based ones like smart speakers, to understand how people's mental models of chatbots change with advancements in the technology.

- Compare user experiences with LLM-driven chatbots versus other mainstream chatbot platforms to provide holistic design implications balancing data collection performance and user perception.

- Test chatbots extensively with different conversation paths and user conversation styles to identify errors, understand slot filling performance, and customize filters to mitigate problematic behaviors of LLMs like repetitions and randomness.

- Incorporate dialog state tracking techniques to support multi-stage prompting for collecting more slots of information from users.

- Explore ethical considerations of using LLM-driven chatbots for sensitive topics like healthcare, including precautions for users and detection of harmful language.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to power chatbots for collecting user self-reported data through natural conversations. The authors created chatbots for four health topics - sleep, food, work, and exercise - that aim to ask questions to fill predefined information slots. They tested how different prompt designs impact the chatbots' ability to fill slots and exhibit natural conversation behaviors. The prompts consisted of two factors - an information specification format (structured vs descriptive) and a personality modifier. In an online study, 48 participants conversed with the chatbots. On average, the chatbots achieved 79% slot filling rate. The information format affected the chatbots' question-asking behaviors - structured formats led to more direct questions while descriptive ones elicited more secondary questions. The personality modifier made chatbots exhibit more empathy. However, chatbots also had problematic repetitive or erroneous turns. Overall, the results demonstrate the feasibility of using LLMs to easily create chatbots for collecting self-reports through natural dialogues. But effectively steering chatbots requires deliberate prompt engineering.

In summary, this paper explores using large language models like GPT-3 to power chatbots that can have natural conversations with people and collect self-reported information. The authors tested different prompt designs, like specifying slots in a structured or descriptive format, and adding a personality modifier. In a study with 48 people conversing with the chatbots, they found prompts impact chatbots' abilities to ask questions and show empathy. On average, their chatbots asked questions to fill 79% of desired slots. But chatbots also had repetitive or incorrect responses. The results show prompts can steer chatbot behaviors, but designing robust prompts requires more research. Overall, the paper provides insights into leveraging large language models for chatbots to reliably collect user data through natural dialogues.
