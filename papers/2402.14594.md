# [Improving Assessment of Tutoring Practices using Retrieval-Augmented   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14594)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- One-on-one human tutoring is effective for learning, but its effectiveness depends on the competencies of the tutor. 
- Novice math tutors often prioritize content knowledge over social-emotional skills like building relationships. However, social-emotional skills are crucial for holistic student development.  
- Accurately evaluating tutor competencies, especially social-emotional skills, is challenging and usually requires expert human raters, which is expensive and infeasible at scale.

Proposed Solution:
- This preliminary study explores using large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to automatically assess tutors' social-emotional competencies from transcripts of real tutoring sessions.
- Four prompting strategies are examined - two basic zero-shot prompts, Tree of Thought prompt, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompt.
- Accuracy is evaluated by correctness and hallucination metrics annotated by a human coder. Cost analysis is also conducted.

Main Contributions:
- RAG prompt demonstrated the most accurate performance in evaluating tutors' social-emotional competencies for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
- RAG prompt also had the lowest financial costs among the prompting strategies.
- Findings indicate potential for using RAG prompt and GPT models to accurately and cost-effectively assess tutor competencies automatically.
- Can enable developing personalized tutor training programs to improve tutoring effectiveness.

In summary, this preliminary study shows promise for using GPT models with RAG prompting to provide automatic, accurate and affordable assessment of human tutors' competencies. This can ultimately enhance the quality and effectiveness of human tutoring.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This preliminary study explores using large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with different prompting strategies to automatically assess the social-emotional learning competencies of human tutors, finding that a retrieval-augmented generation prompting approach demonstrated better performance and lower cost than other strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing and evaluating different prompting strategies with GPT models to automatically assess the social-emotional learning competencies of human tutors. Specifically, the paper explored using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with two basic zero-shot prompts, a Tree of Thought prompt, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based prompt to generate assessments and feedback on tutors' use of social-emotional teaching strategies. A key finding was that the RAG prompt demonstrated more accurate performance in terms of lower levels of hallucination and higher correctness, while also having a lower financial cost compared to the other prompting strategies. The paper concludes that the RAG prompt shows promise for automatically assessing tutor competencies to guide personalized tutor training and improve tutoring effectiveness. In summary, the core contribution is utilizing state-of-the-art language models with a tailored RAG prompt for accurate and cost-effective evaluation of human tutor skills.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using GPT models for automatically assessing tutors' ability to provide social-emotional support. What are some potential challenges or limitations of using AI for evaluating human social-emotional skills? How could the authors address these?

2. The RAG prompt outperformed other strategies in accuracy and cost. In detail, how does the RAG prompt leverage both the tutoring transcripts and principles to enable more precise evaluation compared to the other prompts? 

3. The authors use Word2Vec embeddings as the basis for storing information to augment the GPT models. What are other advanced embedding techniques that could further enrich the information available to the models?

4. Only one human annotator was used to evaluate the GPT outputs on correctness and hallucination. What are some best practices on rigorously establishing inter-rater reliability when using human evaluation?

5. The paper focuses specifically on social-emotional assessment. How could the prompting strategies and overall methodology be extended to assess additional facets of tutoring like content knowledge and pedagogical skills?  

6. The financial analysis provides useful insights on prompt selection and model choice. What other economic factors should be considered for wider deployment in educational settings?

7. How do the different prompting strategies implicitly constrain or guide the GPT models? What risks arise from overly structuring the modeling task?

8. For reproducibility and comparison, what specific computing infrastructure and model parameters were used to execute the experiments with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4?

9. The RAG prompt demonstrates lower hallucination for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Does this indicate the issue arises more from the prompt engineering than model performance?  

10. How can the correlations between the five tutoring principles be accounted for? Would a composite score be more robust or scores tailored to each principle?
