# [HouseDiffusion: Vector Floorplan Generation via a Diffusion Model with   Discrete and Continuous Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13287)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to generate high-quality vector floorplans that satisfy given input constraints, while ensuring geometric consistency and enabling non-rectangular layouts. The key hypothesis is that modeling both continuous and discrete representations within a diffusion model framework will allow more precise control over the final vector outputs.

The core ideas are:

- Represent the floorplan as 1D polygonal loops (vector graphics) rather than raster images. This allows direct control over the geometry. 

- Use a diffusion model to iteratively denoise an initial random vector floorplan. The diffusion model has two heads - one for continuous coordinate regression, and one for inferring discrete/binary coordinates to enforce geometric relationships.

- Design specialized attention mechanisms in the diffusion model to ensure information sharing between related architectural elements like adjacent rooms.

- Evaluate on the RPLAN dataset, comparing against prior raster-based (HouseGAN++) and scene graph approaches in terms of diversity, compatibility with input constraints, and realism. Demonstrate superior performance, as well as new capabilities like control over number of corners.

So in summary, it introduces a diffusion modeling approach specialized for vector floorplan generation, with innovations in dual continuous/discrete modeling and graph-constrained attention, showing strong quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing work. The core hypothesis is that this modeling approach will enable high-quality, controllable vector-graphics output.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a novel approach for vector-floorplan generation via a diffusion model. The main contributions are:

1. It denoises 2D coordinates of room/door corners with two inference objectives: a single-step noise as the continuous quantity to precisely invert the continuous forward process, and the final 2D coordinate as the discrete quantity to establish geometric incident relationships like parallelism, orthogonality, and corner-sharing.

2. It represents a floorplan as 1D polygonal loops, each corresponding to a room or a door, for graph-constrained floorplan generation. 

3. It employs a Transformer architecture at the core, which controls the attention masks based on the input graph-constraint and generates vector-graphics floorplans via a discrete and continuous denoising process.

4. It achieves significant improvements in all metrics against state-of-the-art methods on the RPLAN dataset, while being capable of generating non-Manhattan structures and controlling the exact number of corners per room.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel diffusion model approach for graph-constrained vector-floorplan generation that uses both continuous and discrete denoising objectives to achieve high quality vector graphics output. The method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques by large margins.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of diffusion models for floorplan generation:

- The key novelty is using a diffusion model that performs both continuous and discrete denoising to generate vector graphics floorplans directly. Most prior work uses raster-based methods like GANs that require post-processing to vectorize. 

- It is the first paper to apply diffusion models to structured geometry generation with precise geometric relationships. Prior diffusion model work on geometry focused on 3D shapes or molecular structures without the same strict constraints.

- The method significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art HouseGAN++ on diversity, compatibility, and realism metrics on the RPLAN dataset. It also works for non-Manhattan floorplans unlike HouseGAN++.

- Architecturally, it employs a transformer model with specialized attention modules and input embeddings to enforce the structural relationships in the floorplan based on the input bubble diagram graph.

- The use of both continuous and discrete outputs is novel, as most diffusion models just predict the noise. The discrete output helps enforce geometric consistency.

- They perform extensive ablations to justify architectural choices and experiment with different denoising strategies. The experiments are far more rigorous than most prior work.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in task novelty, technical approach, superior results, and thorough experimentation compared to relevant diffusion model papers. It moves the state-of-the-art in floorplan generation forward considerably.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest several potential directions for future research, including:

- Developing methods to handle large-scale buildings. The current approach focuses on generating residential floorplans, but adapting it to handle large commercial or industrial buildings with more complex requirements would be an impactful extension.

- Exploring alternative loss functions or training techniques tailored for the geometric relationships in floorplans. The current approach uses simple regression losses, but losses that encode geometric constraints may improve performance.

- Generating 3D building models, not just 2D floorplans. The authors' vector graphics approach could potentially be extended to 3D. This would require handling challenges like modeling wall thicknesses, heights, etc.

- Interactive or iterative co-creative design with human users. Allowing human users to provide high-level guidance during floorplan generation could make the system more usable.

- Incorporating physics or engineering constraints like load-bearing walls, plumbing, etc. The current approach focuses on architectural layout, but adding functional constraints would increase practical applicability.

- Exploring alternative data representations beyond 1D polygonal loops per room. The representation used in this work is designed for the bubble diagram constraint, but other representations may have complementary strengths.

- Applying the techniques to other types of vector graphics beyond floorplans, such as icons, diagrams, etc. The discrete and continuous denoising approach may generalize.

In summary, key directions are extending the approach to larger scales and 3D models, incorporating more domain-specific constraints and applications, improving the user interactivity, and exploring alternative techniques tailored for structured geometry generation.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "HouseDiffusion: Vector Floorplan Generation via a Diffusion Model with Discrete and Continuous Denoising":

The paper presents a novel approach for vector floorplan generation using a diffusion model. The key idea is to denoise the 2D coordinates of room/door corners with two different objectives: 1) Predicting the single-step noise as a continuous quantity to precisely invert the continuous forward diffusion process. 2) Predicting the final 2D coordinate as a discrete quantity to establish geometric relationships like parallelism, orthogonality, and corner-sharing. The model uses a Transformer architecture to process the floorplan representation at each diffusion step. It employs structured attention masking based on the input graph constraint. The model is trained end-to-end to denoise both the continuous noise and the discrete coordinates using simple L2 regression losses. After diffusion iterations, the discrete coordinates become the final vector floorplan. This hybrid discrete-continuous denoising within the diffusion process allows the model to generate high-quality vector graphics floorplans.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of graph-constrained floorplan generation. Specifically, it is looking at generating vector floorplans directly from a graph constraint, rather than generating raster images which require post-processing to convert to vector formats. The key question is how to generate precise geometric relationships like parallel walls and shared corners in a vector floorplan, which is difficult with standard regression techniques.

The main contributions of the paper are:

- Representing the floorplan as a set of 1D polygonal loops, one per room/door, which allows enforcing consistency among them.

- Using a diffusion model to denoise the polygonal coordinates, with two objectives: a continuous single-step noise to invert the forward process, and a discrete final coordinate to establish geometric relationships.

- A transformer architecture to control attention based on the input graph constraint and perform the discrete/continuous denoising.

- Significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods on standard metrics as well as enabling new capabilities like non-Manhattan structures.

So in summary, it addresses the vector floorplan generation problem in a graph-constrained context, using a novel diffusion model technique to achieve precise geometries and state-of-the-art performance. The key innovation is the joint discrete/continuous denoising objectives.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach called HouseDiffusion for generating vector floorplan layouts directly from a bubble diagram input constraint. The key idea is to represent a floorplan as a set of 1D polygonal loops, one for each room or door, and generate the 2D coordinates of the loop corners. HouseDiffusion employs a Transformer architecture within a diffusion model framework to iteratively denoise the corner coordinates. A key contribution is the use of both continuous denoising to invert the diffusion process precisely, and discrete denoising to enable exact geometric relationships between components like parallel walls. The Transformer allows different structured attention patterns between components. Experiments demonstrate significant quantitative improvements in diversity, compatibility with the input constraints, and realism compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively, HouseDiffusion generates higher quality layouts, properly satisfying the input constraints. Ablation studies verify the importance of the dual continuous/discrete formulation and structured attention mechanisms. HouseDiffusion represents an advance in generating structured geometric data like floorplans through direct vector graphics generation within a diffusion model.
