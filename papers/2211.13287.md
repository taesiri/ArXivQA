# [HouseDiffusion: Vector Floorplan Generation via a Diffusion Model with   Discrete and Continuous Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13287)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is how to generate high-quality vector floorplans that satisfy given input constraints, while ensuring geometric consistency and enabling non-rectangular layouts. The key hypothesis is that modeling both continuous and discrete representations within a diffusion model framework will allow more precise control over the final vector outputs.The core ideas are:- Represent the floorplan as 1D polygonal loops (vector graphics) rather than raster images. This allows direct control over the geometry. - Use a diffusion model to iteratively denoise an initial random vector floorplan. The diffusion model has two heads - one for continuous coordinate regression, and one for inferring discrete/binary coordinates to enforce geometric relationships.- Design specialized attention mechanisms in the diffusion model to ensure information sharing between related architectural elements like adjacent rooms.- Evaluate on the RPLAN dataset, comparing against prior raster-based (HouseGAN++) and scene graph approaches in terms of diversity, compatibility with input constraints, and realism. Demonstrate superior performance, as well as new capabilities like control over number of corners.So in summary, it introduces a diffusion modeling approach specialized for vector floorplan generation, with innovations in dual continuous/discrete modeling and graph-constrained attention, showing strong quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing work. The core hypothesis is that this modeling approach will enable high-quality, controllable vector-graphics output.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a novel approach for vector-floorplan generation via a diffusion model. The main contributions are:1. It denoises 2D coordinates of room/door corners with two inference objectives: a single-step noise as the continuous quantity to precisely invert the continuous forward process, and the final 2D coordinate as the discrete quantity to establish geometric incident relationships like parallelism, orthogonality, and corner-sharing.2. It represents a floorplan as 1D polygonal loops, each corresponding to a room or a door, for graph-constrained floorplan generation. 3. It employs a Transformer architecture at the core, which controls the attention masks based on the input graph-constraint and generates vector-graphics floorplans via a discrete and continuous denoising process.4. It achieves significant improvements in all metrics against state-of-the-art methods on the RPLAN dataset, while being capable of generating non-Manhattan structures and controlling the exact number of corners per room.In summary, the main contribution is a novel diffusion model approach for graph-constrained vector-floorplan generation that uses both continuous and discrete denoising objectives to achieve high quality vector graphics output. The method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques by large margins.
