# [HouseDiffusion: Vector Floorplan Generation via a Diffusion Model with   Discrete and Continuous Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13287)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is how to generate high-quality vector floorplans that satisfy given input constraints, while ensuring geometric consistency and enabling non-rectangular layouts. The key hypothesis is that modeling both continuous and discrete representations within a diffusion model framework will allow more precise control over the final vector outputs.The core ideas are:- Represent the floorplan as 1D polygonal loops (vector graphics) rather than raster images. This allows direct control over the geometry. - Use a diffusion model to iteratively denoise an initial random vector floorplan. The diffusion model has two heads - one for continuous coordinate regression, and one for inferring discrete/binary coordinates to enforce geometric relationships.- Design specialized attention mechanisms in the diffusion model to ensure information sharing between related architectural elements like adjacent rooms.- Evaluate on the RPLAN dataset, comparing against prior raster-based (HouseGAN++) and scene graph approaches in terms of diversity, compatibility with input constraints, and realism. Demonstrate superior performance, as well as new capabilities like control over number of corners.So in summary, it introduces a diffusion modeling approach specialized for vector floorplan generation, with innovations in dual continuous/discrete modeling and graph-constrained attention, showing strong quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing work. The core hypothesis is that this modeling approach will enable high-quality, controllable vector-graphics output.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a novel approach for vector-floorplan generation via a diffusion model. The main contributions are:1. It denoises 2D coordinates of room/door corners with two inference objectives: a single-step noise as the continuous quantity to precisely invert the continuous forward process, and the final 2D coordinate as the discrete quantity to establish geometric incident relationships like parallelism, orthogonality, and corner-sharing.2. It represents a floorplan as 1D polygonal loops, each corresponding to a room or a door, for graph-constrained floorplan generation. 3. It employs a Transformer architecture at the core, which controls the attention masks based on the input graph-constraint and generates vector-graphics floorplans via a discrete and continuous denoising process.4. It achieves significant improvements in all metrics against state-of-the-art methods on the RPLAN dataset, while being capable of generating non-Manhattan structures and controlling the exact number of corners per room.In summary, the main contribution is a novel diffusion model approach for graph-constrained vector-floorplan generation that uses both continuous and discrete denoising objectives to achieve high quality vector graphics output. The method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques by large margins.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper presents a novel approach for generating vector floorplans using a diffusion model that denoises room/door corner coordinates in both continuous and discrete forms to establish precise geometric relationships while directly outputting vector graphics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of diffusion models for floorplan generation:- The key novelty is using a diffusion model that performs both continuous and discrete denoising to generate vector graphics floorplans directly. Most prior work uses raster-based methods like GANs that require post-processing to vectorize. - It is the first paper to apply diffusion models to structured geometry generation with precise geometric relationships. Prior diffusion model work on geometry focused on 3D shapes or molecular structures without the same strict constraints.- The method significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art HouseGAN++ on diversity, compatibility, and realism metrics on the RPLAN dataset. It also works for non-Manhattan floorplans unlike HouseGAN++.- Architecturally, it employs a transformer model with specialized attention modules and input embeddings to enforce the structural relationships in the floorplan based on the input bubble diagram graph.- The use of both continuous and discrete outputs is novel, as most diffusion models just predict the noise. The discrete output helps enforce geometric consistency.- They perform extensive ablations to justify architectural choices and experiment with different denoising strategies. The experiments are far more rigorous than most prior work.In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in task novelty, technical approach, superior results, and thorough experimentation compared to relevant diffusion model papers. It moves the state-of-the-art in floorplan generation forward considerably.
