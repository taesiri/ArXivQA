# [Convection-Diffusion Equation: A Theoretically Certified Framework for   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15726)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to provide a theoretical foundation to understand neural networks from a partial differential equations (PDE) perspective. Specifically, it tries to model the evolution from a base classifier to a neural network through an operator $\mathcal{T}_t$, and identifies assumptions on $\mathcal{T}_t$ so that its output $u(\vx,t) = \mathcal{T}_t(f)(\vx)$ satisfies a convection-diffusion PDE. Establishing such a PDE framework can improve the interpretability of neural networks. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper first defines operator $\mathcal{T}_t$ which converts a base classifier $f$ to a neural network model. It then makes several assumptions on $\mathcal{T}_t$ which fall into two categories:

NN assumptions: Comparison principle, Markov property, Linearity
PDE assumptions: Locality, Spatial regularity, Temporal regularity

Using these assumptions, the paper theoretically proves that $u(\vx,t)=\mathcal{T}_t(f)(\vx)$ satisfies a convection-diffusion PDE with velocity field $v(\vx,t)$ and diffusion matrix $\sigma(\vx,t)$. This PDE can model the evolution from simpler models to complex neural networks.

Based on the PDE model, the paper designs a Convection-Diffusion Network (COIN) which incorporates explicit diffusion layers after residual blocks. Experiments on node classification, few-shot learning, COVID-19 prediction and prostate cancer classification demonstrate the effectiveness of COIN.

Main Contributions:
- Provides an axiomatic formulation to model neural network evolution as a convection-diffusion process
- Theoretically proves that under reasonable assumptions, the model output satisfies a convection-diffusion PDE  
- Establishes a unified framework that covers various networks like graph diffusion models and randomized smoothing
- Proposes a new COIN model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several tasks
- Improves interpretability of neural networks through PDE perspective
