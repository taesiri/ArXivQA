# [Lumos: Learning Agents with Unified Data, Modular Design, and   Open-Source LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05657)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes Lumos, a novel framework for training language agents that employs a unified data format and modular architecture using open-source large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are: (1) Lumos breaks down complex tasks into high-level subgoals (planning module) which are converted into low-level actions (grounding module) that can be executed by APIs/tools (execution module); (2) It uses a unified data format for training the modules on diverse tasks; (3) It leverages LLMs to convert existing benchmark data into this unified format for high-quality training data; (4) Experiments show Lumos matches or exceeds GPT-based agents and generalizes well, despite using smaller open-source LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper introduces Lumos, a novel framework for training language agents using a unified data format and modular architecture based on open-source large language models (LLMs). The key components of Lumos are the planning, grounding, and execution modules. The planning module breaks down a complex task into high-level subgoals. The grounding module translates these subgoals into low-level executable actions. The execution module implements the actions using various tools and APIs. To train the modules, the authors collected high-quality annotated data by converting existing benchmark datasets into a unified format. Lumos is evaluated on complex QA, web, and math tasks. The results show it achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to larger LLM agents and GPT-based frameworks. It also outperforms other open-source agent training paradigms. Lumos demonstrates effective generalization on unseen tasks, exceeding specialized agents. Overall, the paper presents a novel modular agent framework trained on unified data that enables smaller open-source LLMs to achieve impressive performance on diverse interactive tasks.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces Lumos, a novel framework for training language agents that employs a unified data format and a modular architecture based on open-source large language models (LLMs). Lumos consists of three distinct modules - planning, grounding, and execution. The planning module breaks down a task into a series of high-level, tool-agnostic subgoals. The grounding module then makes these subgoals specific through low-level actions that can be executed by the execution module using various tools and APIs. To train these modules effectively, the authors collected and annotated high-quality data of subgoals and actions for various tasks like question answering, web tasks, and math problems. This unified data representation aids in efficient, high-quality data collection and facilitates cross-task generalization. Despite using only a 7B parameter LLAMA model, Lumos matches or exceeds the performance of GPT-3.5 turbo and GPT-4 based agents on tasks like HotpotQA and Mind2Web. It also outperforms larger 30B-70B parameter open-source agents like WizardLM and AgentLM. Ablation studies demonstrate the advantages of Lumos' modular design over integrated agent training. Overall, Lumos provides a general framework, unified data format, and modular architecture that enables smaller open-source LLMs to achieve strong performance on diverse interactive tasks. The high-quality data collection methodology also facilitates future research on open-source agents for complex tasks.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop an open-source language agent framework with unified data formats and modular design to achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex interactive tasks?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By utilizing a unified data format, modular architecture, and open-source large language models (LLMs), it is possible to create language agents that can match or exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art agents, including those built on proprietary APIs and large closed-source models like GPT-4.

Specifically, the paper introduces a framework called Lumos that consists of separate modules for planning, grounding, and execution. It uses a unified data representation to convert existing benchmark data into a format suitable for training these modules. The goal is to show that this modular framework trained on open data can enable smaller 7B-parameter LLMs to solve complex interactive tasks as effectively as much larger models and without reliance on inaccessible proprietary systems. The paper evaluates Lumos on question answering, web tasks, and math problems to test this hypothesis.

In summary, the core research question is whether modular design, unified training data, and open-source LLMs can produce competitive interactive agents - with the hypothesis being that this approach can match or exceed current closed-sourced state-of-the-art systems. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of the Lumos framework in achieving this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing a general agent framework with a modular design consisting of planning, grounding, and execution modules. This allows breaking down complex tasks into interpretable subgoals and executable actions.

- Developing two interaction formulations - Lumos-Onetime and Lumos-Iterative - to promote collaboration between the modules.

- Collecting high-quality annotated data of around 40k examples by converting existing benchmark reasoning steps into a unified format. This data is used to train the planning and grounding modules.

- Showing that Lumos agents built on smaller 7B LLM can match or exceed the performance of larger LLM agents and GPT-4 based agents on complex QA, web, and math tasks.

- Demonstrating Lumos' ability to generalize to unseen interactive tasks, outperforming larger LLM agents and even specialized agents.

The high-quality annotated data and analyses provide insights into effectively training language agents.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points of comparison between this paper and other related work on language agents:

- Data and Annotations: This paper collects and generates high-quality annotated data in a unified format for training language agent modules. Other works like ReWOO and Self-Instruct synthesize training data, which can introduce noise. This paper leverages existing benchmark data more effectively. 

- Modular Design: The proposed framework has a novel modular design with separate planning, grounding and execution modules. This differs from most prior agent frameworks that train an end-to-end agent model. The modular design facilitates generalization and transfer learning.

- Smaller Models: Unlike most recent work that relies on large proprietary LLMs like GPT-3/4, this paper focuses on empowering smaller open-source LLMs through unified data and modular training.

- Formulations: This paper proposes two new interaction formulations—Lumos-Onetime and Lumos-Iterative—for language agents. Other frameworks like ReAct use a prompting-based formulation.

- Generalization: Due to the unified data format and modular design, this method shows strong generalization ability to unseen tasks. Most prior agents are specialized for certain tasks like QA or web tasks.

- Performance: Despite using a smaller LLM, this method achieves better or comparable performance to GPT-3.5/4 agents on certain complex QA and web tasks. It also outperforms larger open-source agent models.

Overall, the key novelties are using high-quality unified annotations to train modular agent components for strong generalization, rather than end-to-end fine-tuning. The results demonstrate the viability of building competitive agents with smaller open-source LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 After reviewing the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different model architectures and training methods for the planning, grounding, and execution modules in the Lumos framework. The authors propose modularizing these skills but there is room to experiment with different implementations.

- Expanding the capabilities of open-source LLMs for language agent tasks through methods like knowledge distillation. The authors show Lumos can achieve strong performance with a smaller LLAMA model, but transferring knowledge from even more capable models like GPT-3 or PALM could further improve open-source agents.

- Creating more unified data formats and annotations to facilitate cross-task generalization and transfer learning. The authors demonstrate the benefit of their unified data format on an unseen task, but collecting annotations for even more diverse tasks could improve generalization.

- Testing the Lumos framework on a wider range of complex interactive tasks like coding, dialogue, robot control, etc. The authors evaluate on QA, web, and math tasks but the general framework could support many different applications.

- Exploring iterative formulations like Lumos-I further to build more adaptive agents that interact with users or environments. The iterative approach could enable agents that better leverage intermediate results.

- Combining the strengths of the one-shot Lumos-O and iterative Lumos-I formulations. A hybrid approach could generate an overall plan upfront but still modify actions based on intermediate results.

- Developing simulations and benchmarks to evaluate cross-task generalization abilities. The authors use a text-based game, but more complex simulators and standardized benchmarks would better measure generalization.

- Studying how to build agents that can learn and expand their own action spaces over time through exploration. Instead of just adapting to new predefined actions, agents could discover new capabilities.

In summary, the key areas are extending the modular framework, improving open-source LM agents, creating more unified data, testing on diverse tasks, iteratively adapting plans, evaluating generalization, and expanding agent action spaces.
