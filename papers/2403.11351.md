# [An SDP-based Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for Biclustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11351)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of biclustering, which involves simultaneously clustering the rows and columns of a data matrix into groups such that the rows and columns within a group display similar patterns. As a model problem for biclustering, the paper considers the $k$-densest-disjoint biclique ($k$-DDB) problem. The goal is to identify $k$ disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs (called bicliques) within a given weighted complete bipartite graph such that the sum of the densities of these bicliques is maximized. This problem is NP-hard.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a branch-and-cut algorithm tailored to the $k$-DDB problem. The main components are:

1) SDP Relaxation: A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the problem is derived. To strengthen the relaxation, valid inequalities based on hypermetric constraints are added in a cutting-plane fashion. The SDP is approximately solved at each node using an augmented Lagrangian method.

2) Valid Bounds: The output of the SDP solver is post-processed to derive valid upper bounds on the optimal value through the perturbation of the dual objective. 

3) Rounding Heuristic: A heuristic based on $k$-means clustering and maximum weight matching is used to obtain high-quality feasible solutions from the SDP relaxation. This gives lower bounds.

4) Branching Strategy: A specialized branching strategy is employed to partition the problem into smaller subproblems. Each subproblem is reformulated as an SDP over lower dimensional cones.

Main Contributions:
- First exact algorithm for the $k$-DDB problem that scales to thousands of vertices
- Cutting-plane approach to tighten SDP relaxation 
- Safe dual perturbation method to get valid bounds from approximate SDP
- Specialized heuristic leveraging the SDP solution
- Reformulation technique to reduce subproblem sizes  

The proposed branch-and-cut algorithm significantly outperforms general-purpose solvers, solving real-world instances approximately 20 times larger. The paper provides valuable insights into developing global optimization techniques for biclustering problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a branch-and-cut algorithm based on semidefinite programming to solve the NP-hard k-densest disjoint biclique problem for biclustering large graphs with up to a few thousand vertices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving the $k$-densest-disjoint biclique ($k$-DDB) problem to global optimality. The main contributions are:

1) It formulates the $k$-DDB problem as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). This formulation is shown to be equivalent to a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP).

2) It proposes an SDP-based branch-and-cut algorithm tailored for the $k$-DDB problem. The components of this algorithm include:

- An SDP relaxation strengthened with valid inequalities that are separated using a cutting plane approach. This provides a computationally efficient bounding procedure.  

- A maximum weight matching heuristic that finds high-quality feasible solutions by exploiting the SDP relaxation. This gives good lower bounds.

- A branching strategy based on must-link and cannot-link constraints that partitions large SDP relaxations into smaller dimensional ones. 

3) Extensive computational experiments show that the algorithm can solve real-world instances with thousands of vertices to proven optimality. This is around 20 times larger than instances solved by general-purpose solvers.

In summary, the main contribution is a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm for the $k$-DDB problem that leverages SDP relaxations and demonstrates exceptional scalability compared to off-the-shelf solvers.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Biclustering/co-clustering: Simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a data matrix to identify subgroups with similar behavior.

- $k$-densest-disjoint biclique ($k$-DDB) problem: Problem of finding $k$ disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs (bicliques) in a graph such that the sum of their densities is maximized. Used as a model problem for biclustering.

- Semidefinite programming (SDP): Convex optimization approach used to formulate a relaxation of the $k$-DDB problem. 

- Branch-and-cut: Optimization technique that combines branch-and-bound search with cutting planes to solve mixed-integer programs. Proposed algorithm uses SDP bounding and valid inequalities.

- Valid inequalities: Additional linear constraints that are satisfied by all feasible integer solutions. Used to tighten the SDP relaxation bound. 

- First-order/augmented Lagrangian methods: Efficient techniques to approximately solve large-scale SDP relaxations.

- Rounding heuristic: Procedure to extract a feasible biclustering solution from the SDP relaxation solution.

- Disjoint/exclusive biclusters: Biclusters where each row and column belongs to exactly one bicluster. Leads to biclusters with block-diagonal structure.

The main focus is on developing a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm to globally solve the NP-hard $k$-DDB problem using SDP relaxations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the branch-and-cut method for biclustering proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a non-convex QCQP formulation for the $k$-densest disjoint biclique ($k$-DDB) problem. What is the key difficulty in solving this formulation to global optimality and why does it require a tailored approach compared to general QCQP solvers?

2. Explain the rationale behind employing a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation within the branch-and-cut framework. In particular, discuss the tradeoffs between interior point methods and first-order augmented Lagrangian methods for solving large-scale SDP relaxations. 

3. The paper shows that the SDP relaxation is tight for input graphs generated from the planted bicluster model. Elaborate on the properties of graphs compliant with this model. Why does the basic SDP relaxation fail to be tight on real-world instances?

4. Discuss in detail the different components of the proposed valid inequalities, including pair, triangle and hypermetric inequalities. What is the complexity of separating these inequalities and how are they iteratively added and purged within the cutting-plane approach?

5. Explain the post-processing procedure outlined in Theorem 3.3 that produces valid upper bounds from approximately solved SDP relaxations. What is the key result needed to ensure the bounds are theoretically valid?  

6. The rounding heuristic involves a $k$-means clustering step followed by solving an assignment problem. Elaborate on how the solution of the SDP relaxation is exploited in this procedure to obtain high-quality feasible solutions.

7. Discuss how constraints are imposed in the branching strategy to partition the parent node into smaller subproblems that can be formulated as lower dimensional SDPs. What is the rationale behind selecting the branching variable based on the minimum violation of assignment constraints?

8. From a practical perspective, what bottlenecks emerge as the number of vertices in the input graph increases? How can the different components of the algorithm, namely the SDP bounding, cutting plane and rounding procedures, be further improved to enhance scalability?

9. Compare and contrast the biclustering approach in this paper with traditional one-way clustering methods. What are the main advantages of identifying biclusters over conventional clustering?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on the $k$-DDB criterion for biclustering. What other relevant formulations exist and what modifications would be needed to adapt the proposed branch-and-cut method to optimize different biclustering objectives?
