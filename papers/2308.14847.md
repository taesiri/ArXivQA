# [NSF: Neural Surface Fields for Human Modeling from Monocular Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14847)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: Can we learn a clothed human body model from monocular depth sequences that is flexible, coherent across frames, and computationally efficient for surface extraction?The key points are:- The goal is to learn a 3D human body model from monocular depth video that can capture detailed clothing deformations and is animatable. - Existing methods have limitations in efficiency, mesh coherence across frames, and flexibility in resolution/topology.- Implicit function based methods (like Neural Radiance Fields) require expensive per-frame surface extraction and produce incoherent meshes. - Methods relying on a template mesh are limited by its topology/resolution.- This paper proposes Neural Surface Fields (NSF) to overcome these limitations. NSF defines a continuous deformation field over a canonical surface to capture details while allowing efficient coherent surface extraction.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling pose-dependent deformations as a neural surface field over a canonical shape can enable efficient, flexible, and coherent clothed human body modeling from monocular depth. NSF is proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Neural Surface Fields (NSF), a novel method for modeling detailed 3D clothed humans from monocular depth sequences. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Proposing NSF, which is a continuous neural field defined over the surface of a canonical shape. NSF models flexible displacement fields to capture detailed clothing deformations. 2. Using NSF for avatarization from monocular depth. NSF allows recovering detailed human shapes from sparse depth data in a self-supervised manner.3. NSF enables reconstructing coherent meshes at arbitrary resolutions without retraining. This provides flexibility compared to prior works. 4. NSF avoids expensive per-frame surface extraction like marching cubes, making it much faster (40-180x) than prior implicit or point cloud based methods.5. Evaluation on various datasets shows NSF outperforms recent competitors in reconstruction accuracy, while being more efficient and flexible.In summary, the main contribution is proposing Neural Surface Fields, which is a compact and efficient representation for modeling detailed clothed human avatars from monocular depth sequences in a flexible manner. The key advantages are avoiding per-frame surface extraction, enabling arbitrary topology/resolution, and self-supervised training.
