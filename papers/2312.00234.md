# [Deep Equilibrium Based Neural Operators for Steady-State PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural operators have shown promise for solving PDEs by learning solution operators that map PDE coefficients to solutions. However, the architectural design space is still poorly understood, especially when incorporating structural knowledge about the PDE family.

- This paper focuses on steady-state PDEs which can be written as finding u such that L(a,u) = f. This includes many equations like Poisson, electrostatic, steady Navier-Stokes.

Proposed Solution:
- Show that solutions to steady-state PDEs can be expressed as fixed points of nonlinear operators. Inspired by this and classical iterative solvers, propose weight-tied architectures. 

- Introduce FNO-DEQ, a deep equilibrium variant of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) that uses implicit differentiation and root finding to approximate the fixed point solution. Views FNO-DEQ as an "infinitely unrolled" weight-tied network.

- Empirically demonstrate superior performance of FNO-DEQ over standard FNO on Darcy flow and steady Navier-Stokes equations, especially under noisy conditions. FNO-DEQ matches performance of much larger FNO networks.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate benefits of weight tying as an inductive bias for neural operator architectures applied to steady-state PDEs
- Propose FNO-DEQ architecture and show strong empirical performance over baselines
- Show FNO-DEQ is more robust to noise
- Provide theoretical justification that FNO-DEQ can universally approximate solutions to broad family of steady-state PDEs
- Create dataset of steady Navier-Stokes solutions for community benchmarking

In summary, the paper clearly identifies the problem setting, provides both theoretical grounding and empirical evidence for the advantages of proposed FNO-DEQ over baselines, and offers a dataset to facilitate further research.
