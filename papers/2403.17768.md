# [SciNews: From Scholarly Complexities to Public Narratives -- A Dataset   for Scientific News Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17768)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scientific publications are often highly complex and inaccessible to general audiences, limiting public engagement with important research discoveries. Translating academic insights into simplified news narratives can bridge this gap. 
- However, there is a lack of datasets to support the automated generation of scientific news reports from research papers. Existing corpora focus narrowly on biomedical summaries or are small in scale.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new dataset called "SciNews" to enable the automated generation of scientific news reports. 
- SciNews contains 41,872 article-news pairs across 9 scientific disciplines like physics, engineering, computer science etc.
- They perform quantitative analysis showing news articles are significantly more readable, use simpler vocabulary/syntax and have higher lexical diversity compared to academic papers.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of a new task: Automated Scientific News Report Generation (SNG)
- Release of the large-scale SciNews dataset for this task with detailed benchmarks
- Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models, finding abstractive models outperform extractive methods
- Identifying main issues in model outputs via human evaluation - hallucinations, factual inconsistencies, lack of focus
- Analysis highlighting gaps between model performance and human writing proficiency, indicating opportunities for future research

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in introducing the dataset and task formulation for automatic generation of reader-friendly news narratives from complex academic articles across scientific domains. Both the corpus and experimental results provide a valuable foundation to make scientific insights more accessible to the broader public.
