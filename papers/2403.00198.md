# [AXOLOTL: Fairness through Assisted Self-Debiasing of Large Language   Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown great capabilities in natural language processing tasks, but they also perpetuate biases present in their training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. 
- Existing debiasing methods often require extensive computational resources, may compromise model performance, rely on access to internal model parameters, or are constrained to specific tasks or attributes.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes Axolotl, a novel post-processing framework for debiasing LLM outputs through assisted self-debiasing. 
- Inspired by zero-shot learning, Axolotl has a 3-step process: (1) Identify bias orientation and issue in LLM output, (2) Suggest a "pleasant" resolution, (3) Guide model to rewrite output incorporating the resolution to self-debias.
- Treats LLM as black box, interacts via public APIs without needing internal access. Model-agnostic, task-agnostic.

Main Contributions:
- First methodology for self-debiasing LLMs without needing model access, pre-training or fine-tuning.
- Novel 3-step zero-shot learning based process for bias identification, resolution suggestion and guided self-debiasing. 
- Experiments across multiple models, tasks and bias attributes demonstrate reduced toxicity, stereotyping and regard bias in rewritten outputs.
- Computationally efficient, preserves model performance, easy integration via public APIs.

In summary, the paper offers a promising approach to mitigate biases in LLM outputs through assisted self-debiasing, with broad applicability and ease of use. The model-agnostic and zero-shot based methodology is the main highlight.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Axolotl, a novel post-processing framework that leverages self-debiasing techniques to mitigate biases in language model outputs by treating models as black boxes, identifying issues through embeddings, proposing resolutions, and guiding models to revise responses, thus improving fairness without compromising efficiency or performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel post-processing framework called Axolotl that can mitigate biases in large language model (LLM) outputs. Specifically:

- Axolotl operates in a model-agnostic and task-agnostic manner to debias LLM outputs without requiring access to the models' internal parameters or configurations. It treats the LLM as a "black box" and interacts with it via public APIs.

- It uses a 3-step process inspired by zero-shot learning to identify biases, propose resolutions, and guide the model to self-debias its outputs. 

- Axolotl aims to be computationally efficient and preserve model performance while reducing bias. It does not require expensive pre-training or fine-tuning of models.

- It can handle debiasing across multiple demographic groups and sensitive attributes like gender, race, and profession.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Axolotl as a novel, efficient post-processing framework to reduce biases in LLM outputs by leveraging guided self-debiasing, without compromising performance or needing internal access to the models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Self-debiasing - The paper introduces a model called "Axolotl" that utilizes a self-debiasing technique to mitigate biases in large language model (LLM) outputs. 

- Model-agnostic - Axolotl is designed to work in a model-agnostic way, meaning it can work with different LLMs without needing access to internal model parameters.

- Task-agnostic - Similarly, Axolotl aims to be task-agnostic, meaning it can handle different applications and use cases.

- Bias detection - The paper outlines a computational process to detect bias in LLM outputs using embedding vectors and predefined lists of "pleasant" and "unpleasant" words.

- Zero-shot learning - The debiasing process is inspired by zero-shot learning, where the model is given a textual description to guide its outputs without explicit training examples. 

- Black box interaction - A key feature of Axolotl is its ability to interact with LLMs as "black boxes" using public APIs, without requiring access to internal configurations.

- Self-assistance - The debiasing happens through a form of self-assistance, where Axolotl provides the LLM with guidance on how to rewrite its output to resolve detected biases.

In summary, the key themes are around self-debiasing, model/task flexibility, bias quantification, and black box interaction to mitigate biases in LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions treating the LLM as a "black box" and using public APIs to interact with it. Can you elaborate more on why this design choice enables broader applicability and ease of use? What are the limitations of requiring direct access to the LLM's internal parameters?

2. The three-step process of identifying bias orientation and issue, proposing a resolution, and guiding the model to self-debias is inspired by zero-shot learning. Can you explain this analogy further? How does framing the debiasing process as a zero-shot learning task facilitate self-debiasing? 

3. The paper identifies bias in an LLM response as a combination of an orientation toward a demographic group and an associated unpleasant characteristic or issue. What is the rationale behind requiring both components to determine the presence of bias? When would orientation alone not necessarily indicate harmful bias?

4. When identifying a resolution, the paper aims to find a vector that when added to the response vector, makes it orthogonal to the unpleasant vector. Can you explain in more detail the mathematical formulation behind this vector rejection concept? Why is achieving orthogonality important?

5. Since the success of the proposed method depends heavily on the quality of embedded vectors, what steps were taken to ensure the embeddings effectively captured semantic biases? How could deficiencies in the embeddings negatively impact performance?

6. While the method introduces a mechanism for debiasing, it does not assure absolute eradication of bias since it operates without altering the modelâ€™s parameters. What are some examples of inherent biases that could persist despite the post-processing corrections applied by the method?

7. The self-debiasing performance of the smaller LLM models sometimes matched or surpassed that of larger models in certain experiments. Why do you think that occurred in some cases? What factors play a role in debiasing capability besides model size?

8. The paper aimed to reduce negative regard while minimizing changes to positive regard when evaluating chat completion. Why was maintaining positive regard important for assessing effectiveness, in contrast to just reducing negative regard? What would a drastic reduction in positive regard suggest?

9. Since the method relies on online access to LLMs, what adaptations would need to be made to facilitate offline use cases without connectivity? Could the debiasing process be adapted to work with in-house LLMs directly? 

10. What steps were taken during the evaluation tasks to promote gender-neutral responses instead of simply reversing gender stereotypes to the opposite extreme? Why was achieving gender neutralization an important evaluation consideration?
