# [AXOLOTL: Fairness through Assisted Self-Debiasing of Large Language   Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown great capabilities in natural language processing tasks, but they also perpetuate biases present in their training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. 
- Existing debiasing methods often require extensive computational resources, may compromise model performance, rely on access to internal model parameters, or are constrained to specific tasks or attributes.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes Axolotl, a novel post-processing framework for debiasing LLM outputs through assisted self-debiasing. 
- Inspired by zero-shot learning, Axolotl has a 3-step process: (1) Identify bias orientation and issue in LLM output, (2) Suggest a "pleasant" resolution, (3) Guide model to rewrite output incorporating the resolution to self-debias.
- Treats LLM as black box, interacts via public APIs without needing internal access. Model-agnostic, task-agnostic.

Main Contributions:
- First methodology for self-debiasing LLMs without needing model access, pre-training or fine-tuning.
- Novel 3-step zero-shot learning based process for bias identification, resolution suggestion and guided self-debiasing. 
- Experiments across multiple models, tasks and bias attributes demonstrate reduced toxicity, stereotyping and regard bias in rewritten outputs.
- Computationally efficient, preserves model performance, easy integration via public APIs.

In summary, the paper offers a promising approach to mitigate biases in LLM outputs through assisted self-debiasing, with broad applicability and ease of use. The model-agnostic and zero-shot based methodology is the main highlight.
