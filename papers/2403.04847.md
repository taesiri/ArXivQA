# [Solving Inverse Problems with Model Mismatch using Untrained Neural   Networks within Model-based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04847)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Model-based deep learning methods like loop unrolling (LU) and deep equilibrium models (DEQ) have shown outstanding performance in solving inverse problems. However, their success relies heavily on having an accurate forward model. This assumption can be limiting in many applications due to model simplifications, calibration errors, computational constraints requiring simplified models, or lack of knowledge of certain features. The paper considers cases where only an approximation of the true forward model is available.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes two methods to address forward model mismatch by incorporating an untrained neural network residual block within LU and DEQ architectures. This residual network matches the data consistency in the measurement domain for each instance to account for model mismatch.

Key ideas:
- Formulate the problem using half-quadratic splitting to introduce an auxiliary variable and split the objective into separate terms.
- Propose an $\mathcal{A}$-adaptive LU method with iterative updates of the auxiliary variable, residual network parameters, and reconstruction. The residual network is untrained and optimized per instance.
- Prove convergence of the iterative updates under mild conditions.
- Extend to an $\mathcal{A}$-adaptive DEQ method to allow more iterations and achieve an equilibrium solution.

Main Contributions:
- Present a general framework to handle model mismatch in model-based architectures using untrained neural networks
- Introduce untrained residual networks that provide instance-specific corrections  
- Proof of convergence and empirical validation
- Demonstrate improved performance over robust training baseline on image deblurring, seismic deconvolution, and image defogging tasks
- Show more effective intermediate reconstructions 
- Establish robustness to network initialization and higher number of iterations

The proposed active strategy for correcting model mismatch outperforms passive robust training. By separately handling model fitting and signal regularization, the method leads to superior and more stable reconstructions.
