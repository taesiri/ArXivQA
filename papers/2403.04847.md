# [Solving Inverse Problems with Model Mismatch using Untrained Neural   Networks within Model-based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04847)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Model-based deep learning methods like loop unrolling (LU) and deep equilibrium models (DEQ) have shown outstanding performance in solving inverse problems. However, their success relies heavily on having an accurate forward model. This assumption can be limiting in many applications due to model simplifications, calibration errors, computational constraints requiring simplified models, or lack of knowledge of certain features. The paper considers cases where only an approximation of the true forward model is available.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes two methods to address forward model mismatch by incorporating an untrained neural network residual block within LU and DEQ architectures. This residual network matches the data consistency in the measurement domain for each instance to account for model mismatch.

Key ideas:
- Formulate the problem using half-quadratic splitting to introduce an auxiliary variable and split the objective into separate terms.
- Propose an $\mathcal{A}$-adaptive LU method with iterative updates of the auxiliary variable, residual network parameters, and reconstruction. The residual network is untrained and optimized per instance.
- Prove convergence of the iterative updates under mild conditions.
- Extend to an $\mathcal{A}$-adaptive DEQ method to allow more iterations and achieve an equilibrium solution.

Main Contributions:
- Present a general framework to handle model mismatch in model-based architectures using untrained neural networks
- Introduce untrained residual networks that provide instance-specific corrections  
- Proof of convergence and empirical validation
- Demonstrate improved performance over robust training baseline on image deblurring, seismic deconvolution, and image defogging tasks
- Show more effective intermediate reconstructions 
- Establish robustness to network initialization and higher number of iterations

The proposed active strategy for correcting model mismatch outperforms passive robust training. By separately handling model fitting and signal regularization, the method leads to superior and more stable reconstructions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes methods to address forward model mismatch in model-based deep learning architectures for solving inverse problems by incorporating an untrained neural network residual block that iteratively matches data consistency in the measurement domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents a general model-based architecture for solving inverse problems when only an approximate forward model is available. This is in contrast to most model-based methods that require precise knowledge of the forward model.

2. It introduces an untrained neural network within the model-based architecture to match the data consistency in the measurement domain and handle model mismatch. This allows the method to jointly update the reconstruction and forward model estimate.

3. It proposes two variants of this approach based on loop unrolling and deep equilibrium model architectures. Convergence is proved for the proposed methods under mild conditions.

4. Experiments on linear and nonlinear inverse problems demonstrate superior performance over baseline methods. The proposed approaches are shown to be more effective at intermediate reconstructions, robust to random initialization of the residual network, and stable with more iterations.

In summary, the key contribution is a flexible model-based architecture that can adaptively handle inaccuracies in the forward model by incorporating an untrained neural network, leading to improved reconstruction quality. The convergence analysis and experiments on varied tasks highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an untrained neural network $f_\theta$ to model the forward model mismatch. Why is $f_\theta$ kept untrained instead of being pre-trained? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

2. The update of $f_\theta$ aims to minimize the data-fidelity term with the smallest $\ell_2$ norm. Why is the $\ell_2$ norm chosen here? Would other norms like $\ell_1$ also be reasonable choices and why?  

3. Proposition 1 proves the convergence of the proposed iterative updates under certain conditions. What is the intuition behind this proof? What would happen to the convergence if those conditions were not met?

4. How does the proposed method compare to more direct ways of handling model mismatch, such as jointly updating the model parameters and the signal? What are the limitations of those approaches that motivated the proposed framework?

5. The incorporation of $f_\theta$ increases the computational complexity compared to standard loop unrolling. Are there ways to reduce this complexity while retaining effectiveness? Could approximate optimization methods be leveraged?

6. How does the performance of the method vary with the accuracy of the initial forward model estimate $\mathcal{A}_0$? At what level of inaccuracy would you expect the method to break down? 

7. The convergence proof allows the use of different step size values $\eta_k$ at each iteration $k$. Is it necessary to use a variable step size? Would a fixed step size also work? What are the tradeoffs?

8. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance over passive robust training of loop unrolling networks. What are the key algorithmic differences that lead to this improvement? 

9. The method shows improved reconstruction of intermediate iterates over standard loop unrolling. Why does explicitly handling model mismatch lead to more effective early iterates?

10. What types of regularization could be imposed on $f_\theta$ to prevent overfitting while still allowing it to correct model mismatch effectively? How might this depend on the specifics of the inverse problem?
