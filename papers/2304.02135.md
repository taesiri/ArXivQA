# [FREDOM: Fairness Domain Adaptation Approach to Semantic Scene   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02135)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: How can we improve fairness in semantic scene segmentation models under unsupervised domain adaptation?In particular, the paper proposes a new fairness domain adaptation approach called FREDOM to tackle the fairness problem in semantic segmentation. The key ideas and contributions are:- It formulates a new fairness objective function for semantic scene segmentation to minimize the difference in error rates between classes. - It proposes a fairness domain adaptation framework to impose fair treatment of class distributions and model conditional structural constraints.- It introduces a Conditional Structure Network based on Transformer self-attention to capture spatial relationships and structural dependencies between pixels.- Through ablation studies, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the different components of the proposed approach in improving model fairness.- Experiments on SYNTHIA → Cityscapes and GTA5 → Cityscapes show the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while promoting fairness compared to prior methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by explicitly modeling fairness objectives and structural constraints, the proposed approach can improve fairness of semantic segmentation models under domain adaptation. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
