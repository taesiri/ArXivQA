# [NightRain: Nighttime Video Deraining via Adaptive-Rain-Removal and   Adaptive-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00729)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NightRain: Nighttime Video Deraining via Adaptive-Rain-Removal and Adaptive-Correction":

Problem:
Existing deep learning based nighttime video deraining methods rely on synthetic data for training due to lack of real-world paired data. However, there is a significant domain gap between synthetic and real-world rain streak distribution, causing models to fail to properly remove real-world rain streaks. This leads to over-saturation and color shifts in the derained results.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes NightRain, a nighttime video deraining method with two key components - adaptive rain removal and adaptive correction.

Adaptive Rain Removal: 
Uses unlabeled real-world rain videos. A teacher model generates predictions on the rain videos based on confidence scores. High confidence predictions represent less challenging regions. These predictions and corresponding inputs are used as region-based paired real data to train a student model. This allows handling more challenging regions over iterations.

Adaptive Correction:
Uses real-world clear night videos. Feed them into the teacher model to get predictions. Differences between predictions and clear inputs represent over-saturation/color-shift errors. These are used to retrain student model to continually rectify the errors.

Main Contributions:

1. Adaptive rain removal utilizes unlabeled rain videos for real-world deraining capability, especially in challenging regions. Iterative learning addresses more complex regions.

2. Adaptive correction rectifies over-saturation and color-shift problems by continually learning from differences between predictions and clear night videos.

3. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance - improves PSNR by 13.7% over prior arts. Qualitative results also showcase noticeably better deraining without saturation/color issues.

In summary, the key novelty is using unlabeled real-world rain videos and clear night videos in an adaptive teacher-student framework to enhance deraining capability on real-world data and overcome synthetic-to-real domain gap.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel nighttime video deraining method called NightRain, which utilizes adaptive rain removal and adaptive correction processes to effectively eliminate rain streaks from real-world night videos while avoiding over-saturation and color shift issues commonly faced by existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces an adaptive-rain-removal module to enable the model to remove rain streaks from real-world nighttime rain videos, especially in low-light regions or regions affected by complex light effects. This is done by learning from high-confidence predictions to iteratively address more challenging input regions.

2. It proposes an adaptive-correction module to address over-saturation and color shift problems in the model's predictions. By learning from the differences between clear night videos and the model's predictions of them, it continually rectifies errors in the predictions. 

3. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance in removing rain streaks from nighttime videos quantitatively and qualitatively. The method is effective at removing real-world rain streaks even in the presence of complex light effects without introducing over-saturation or color shift artifacts.

In summary, the main contributions are the novel adaptive-rain-removal and adaptive-correction modules to enable effective real-world nighttime video deraining along with superior detail recovery.
