# [NightRain: Nighttime Video Deraining via Adaptive-Rain-Removal and   Adaptive-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00729)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "NightRain: Nighttime Video Deraining via Adaptive-Rain-Removal and Adaptive-Correction":

Problem:
Existing deep learning based nighttime video deraining methods rely on synthetic data for training due to lack of real-world paired data. However, there is a significant domain gap between synthetic and real-world rain streak distribution, causing models to fail to properly remove real-world rain streaks. This leads to over-saturation and color shifts in the derained results.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes NightRain, a nighttime video deraining method with two key components - adaptive rain removal and adaptive correction.

Adaptive Rain Removal: 
Uses unlabeled real-world rain videos. A teacher model generates predictions on the rain videos based on confidence scores. High confidence predictions represent less challenging regions. These predictions and corresponding inputs are used as region-based paired real data to train a student model. This allows handling more challenging regions over iterations.

Adaptive Correction:
Uses real-world clear night videos. Feed them into the teacher model to get predictions. Differences between predictions and clear inputs represent over-saturation/color-shift errors. These are used to retrain student model to continually rectify the errors.

Main Contributions:

1. Adaptive rain removal utilizes unlabeled rain videos for real-world deraining capability, especially in challenging regions. Iterative learning addresses more complex regions.

2. Adaptive correction rectifies over-saturation and color-shift problems by continually learning from differences between predictions and clear night videos.

3. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance - improves PSNR by 13.7% over prior arts. Qualitative results also showcase noticeably better deraining without saturation/color issues.

In summary, the key novelty is using unlabeled real-world rain videos and clear night videos in an adaptive teacher-student framework to enhance deraining capability on real-world data and overcome synthetic-to-real domain gap.
