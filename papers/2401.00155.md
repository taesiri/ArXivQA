# [A comprehensive framework for occluded human pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Occlusion presents a major challenge in human pose estimation. The key issues are: 1) Lack of occluded training data makes models fail to learn robust features when facing occlusion. 2) Occlusion causes confusion between target person features and interfering person/object features. 3) Occlusion leads to loss of contextual and structural information for pose inference. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a comprehensive framework called DAG with three main components to address occlusion challenges:

1) Mask Joints with Instance Paste data augmentation to simulate diverse occlusion patterns from objects and humans.  

2) Adaptive Discriminative Attention Module to distinguish target features from interference at channel and spatial levels.

3) Feature-Guided Multi-Hop Graph Convolutional Network to exploit body part relationships and feature maps to compensate for information loss and enforce pose structural constraints.

Main Contributions:

- Novel data augmentation technique to mimic real occlusion scenarios with both objects and humans.  

- Adaptive attention mechanism to selectively highlight target human features against occlusion interference.

- Multi-hop graph convolution with feature guidance to compensate for incomplete information and improve occlusion robustness.

- Extensive experiments show consistent and significant performance gains over state-of-the-arts on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness of the approach.

In summary, the paper presents a holistic framework spanning data, features and inference aspects to address occlusion challenges in human pose estimation. Both technically sound designs and empirical gains support DAG as an impactful contribution.
