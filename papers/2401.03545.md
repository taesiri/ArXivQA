# [Is there really a Citation Age Bias in NLP?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03545)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Recent work has claimed there is a growing "citation age bias" in NLP papers, where researchers are increasingly citing more recent papers and forgetting older foundational work ("citation amnesia"). This has been presented as an issue specific to the NLP community. 

- The authors question whether this trend is truly just an NLP issue or reflective of broader patterns across rapidly advancing AI fields. They also ask whether it necessarily constitutes a "bias" or results naturally from the dynamics of fast-progressing research areas.

Methodology:
- The authors analyzed the reference lists and citation age statistics of ~300,000 arXiv papers spanning 15 fields over 2013-2022. Fields covered computer science (split into AI and non-AI), physics, math, electrical engineering, economics, quantitative biology/finance, and statistics.

- Citation age was quantified by mean/median age of citations and percentage of "old" citations (10+ years older than citing paper) per paper. Trends were compared across AI vs non-AI computer science vs non-computer science fields.  

Key Findings:
- Mean/median citation age decreased dramatically over the decade for AI-related computer science subfields (NLP, CV, ML etc), dropping by ~40-60%. Non-AI CS subfields changed little (±2%) and non-CS fields increased slightly.

- Similar trends were seen for percentage of old citations - sharp drops for AI fields but no change or slight increases for other fields.

- Analyses of influential citations and submission growth rates also supported the above differential trends between dynamic AI fields and more static non-AI domains.

Conclusions:
- Decreasing citation age seems intrinsic to rapidly advancing fields rather than an NLP-specific bias. New innovations quickly supersede older knowledge in highly dynamic areas.

- Broad trends of decreasing citation age versus field growth rates suggest the changes partly reflect the natural development patterns of fast-moving research areas, rather than just forgetfulness or bias.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the age of references in about 300,000 scientific papers across 15 fields on Arxiv over 10 years (2013-2022) and finds that AI-related computer science fields have shown a drastic decrease in the average age of cited papers (roughly halving from over 12 years to under 7 years), unlike other computer science and non-computer science fields, suggesting this pattern relates to the high dynamicity of progress in AI rather than a bias specific to the NLP community.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Analyzing the age of citations (average age difference between a citing paper and the papers it cites) in the bibliographies of around 300k papers submitted to arXiv across 15 scientific fields over a 10 year period (2013-2022). 

2) Grouping the fields into 3 categories - CS AI (NLP, CV, ML etc), CS non-AI, and non-CS fields - and finding that CS AI fields have shown a drastic decrease of around 43% in average age of citations over the 10 years, while CS non-AI and non-CS fields have remained relatively stable.

3) Questioning previous claims of a "citation age bias" specifically in NLP by showing that the decreasing age of citations is common across all highly dynamic AI fields, likely due to the fast progress in these fields making older knowledge obsolete quicker. The paper argues this is an expected effect of field dynamics rather than any bias.

In summary, the paper analyzes citation age trends across scientific fields to give a broader perspective on claims of citation amnesia/age bias in AI/NLP research in particular.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Citation age bias
- Citation amnesia
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Artificial intelligence (AI) 
- Computer vision (CV)
- Machine learning (ML)
- Bibliography age
- arXiv papers
- Mean age of citations
- Percentage of old citations
- Influential citations
- Scientific fields
- Computer science (CS)
- Dynamic research fields
- Citation trends
- Temporal analysis
- Aggregate statistics

The paper analyzes citation trends across different scientific fields using 300k papers submitted to the arXiv preprint server from 2013-2022. It specifically looks at the mean and median age of citations, percentage of old citations, and age of influential citations over time. The key finding is that AI fields like NLP, CV, and ML show a decreasing age of citations, whereas other fields do not exhibit the same pattern. This "citation amnesia" may be due to the dynamic nature of AI research rather than an inherent bias. The paper questions claims about citation bias being specific to NLP by putting the analysis in a broader scientific context.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper categorizes papers into 3 broad classes: CS AI, CS non-AI, and non-CS. What is the justification provided for making this categorization? How does analyzing the age of citations for these groups allow for broader conclusions?

2. The metrics used in the analysis are mean age of citations (AoC), median AoC, and percentage of old citations. Why are multiple metrics used rather than just one? What are the potential limitations of relying only on the mean AoC?  

3. Table 1 provides detailed statistics on the number of papers analyzed in each subfield. What story do these numbers tell about the growth of research in AI vs other fields? How might this context impact the analysis of citation age?

4. Figure 3 shows the mean and median AoC grouped into the 3 paper categories. What graphical patterns demonstrate the difference in citation age trends between these groups? Why does this suggest “citation amnesia” may not just apply to NLP?

5. The analysis relies on papers submitted to Arxiv. What are some potential limitations of focusing only on Arxiv rather than a broader range of publication venues? Could this introduce any systematic biases into the analysis?

6. Table 2 shows the percentage of old citations over time. Why is a 10 year threshold used to define “old” citations? Would the conclusions change if a different threshold was used instead? 

7. Figure 4 examines the dynamics of different fields by looking at changes in submissions vs citation age. What does this comparison reveal about the relationship between field dynamicity and citation age patterns?

8. The analysis examines influential citations separately. Why analyze influential citations differently? What similarities and differences exist between normal and influential citation ages?

9. The paper argues the decreasing citation age trend is a natural response for highly dynamic fields. What is the reasoning behind this argument? Do you find this argument compelling or are alternative explanations plausible?

10. The limitations section acknowledges potential issues with using Semantic Scholar data. Could errors in the extracted reference data meaningfully impact the analysis? Why or why not?
