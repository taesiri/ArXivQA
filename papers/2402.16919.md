# [Personalized Federated Instruction Tuning via Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16919)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Federated Instruction Tuning (FIT) allows collaborative model instruction tuning across data owners without sharing private data. However, it faces two key challenges: 1) Data heterogeneity - varying data distributions and preferences among data owners mean FIT cannot adapt to personalized data of individual owners; 2) Resource heterogeneity - Clients with better computational resources are constrained since they need to maintain the same model architecture as weaker clients.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a novel Personalized Federated Instruction Tuning (PerFIT) framework to address these issues using neural architecture search. 

The key ideas are:
1) Allow each client to search for a personalized sparse architecture by expanding the trainable parameter space followed by pruning - This allows personalized tuning while preserving the parameter budget.
2) Use personalized parameter-wise aggregation to match parameters across clients with different architectures to enhance collaboration.

Specifically, the method has the following steps:
1) Clients search for personalized sparse masks through efficient iterative pruning.
2) Clients generate sparse personalized modules and conduct local fine-tuning.  
3) Clients transmit modules to the server where aggregation aligns shared parameters.
4) Server generates new global modules, personalizes them for each client using the sparse masks and redistributes to clients.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes PerFIT method to enable personalized federated instruction tuning and match client capabilities.
2) Analyzes convergence for the personalized sparse architecture search.
3) Empirically demonstrates improved performance over state-of-the-art on multiple large language models. For example, reduces perplexity by 23% on pathological non-IID data.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative personalized architecture search approach to address key limitations of existing federated instruction tuning methods for language models. Experiments validate the benefits of this method.
