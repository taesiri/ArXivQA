# [Hierarchical Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Opinion Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00435)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Online reviews are abundant but it's impractical for users to read hundreds of reviews when choosing a product or hotel. Opinion summarization aims to aggregate reviews into a readable summary reflecting the most common and differentiating opinions. Prior work struggles to be scalable, attributable, and generate coherent summaries.

Solution:
The paper proposes HIRO, a modular approach combining a discrete hierarchical index to identify informative sentences with a language model to generate fluent summaries. 

Key ideas:
1) Learn an encoder mapping sentences to paths in a semantic hierarchy. This representation groups related sentences and enables easy identification of frequent opinions.

2) At test time, index all sentences, find popular paths in the hierarchy, and retrieve corresponding sentence clusters containing prevalent opinions.

3) Pass retrieved clusters to a language model to generate coherent summaries grounded in evidential sentences.

Contributions:
- HIRO generates more coherent and accurate summaries significantly preferred by humans over prior work. It scales to thousands of reviews.

- The learned hierarchical representation is more semantically structured than previous methods. 

- A new automatic evaluation metric balances prevalence of opinions with penalizing generic statements.

- Ablations show combining discrete selection with language model generation is crucial for quality, and increasing model scale alone does not help.

In summary, HIRO advances the state-of-the-art in opinion summarization through a modular approach exploiting both the strengths of discrete representations and neural language models. The improved encoding space and automatic metric are additional notable contributions.
