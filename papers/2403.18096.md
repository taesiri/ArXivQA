# [Efficient Multi-Band Temporal Video Filter for Reducing Human-Robot   Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18096)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mobile robots use on-board sensors for navigation, but these have limited visibility. Fixed cameras can provide complementary information about human activity in the environment to help robots better plan paths and navigate to avoid humans.
- However, continuously processing video to detect human activity and objects is computationally expensive. More efficient methods are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a cascade temporal video filter that efficiently extracts both long-term (isochronal) and short-term human activity from video. 
- Long-term activity captured over many days provides information for global path planning. Short-term activity provides information for local navigation.
- The cascade filter architecture performs the filtering more efficiently (20-33% savings) than separate filters.
- Also propose a hybrid approach using efficient activity detection to gate more expensive neural network object detection. Can reduce computation by 8x and power by 6.5x.

Key Contributions:
1. A single, efficient cascade filter to identify long- and short-term human activity patterns to aid robot navigation.
2. Using the cascade filter for both global path planning and local navigation. 
3. Efficiency analysis showing computational savings of cascade filter and hybrid activity/object detection.
4. Incorporation and demonstration on the ROS robot development framework.

In summary, the paper introduces a more efficient cascade filter to detect human activity from video to help guide robot navigation. Cost and power reductions are demonstrated. The activity information is integrated into the ROS framework to influence path planning and navigation costs.
