# [News Source Credibility Assessment: A Reddit Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social media platforms like Reddit enable the widespread dissemination of fake news and misinformation. Identifying low-credibility sources on these platforms is challenging due to the volume and diversity of content creators.
- Existing fake news detection methods focus on categorizing content as true or false rather than evaluating source credibility over time.
- Assessing community susceptibility to misinformation for different topics has not been well explored. 

Proposed Solution - CREDiBERT:
- Introduces a new semi-supervised neural network model called CREDiBERT, specialized for assessing Reddit submission source credibility over time by comparing submissions about the same events.  
- Leverages Reddit's community structure to automatically curate a novel dataset of 1.3M pairs of submissions referencing identical events but from different sources.
- Adopts a Siamese neural network architecture that brings similar submissions closer and distances dissimilar ones in the latent space depending on their credibility discrepancy.
- Outperforms BERT-based classifiers by 9% in F1 score for binary credibility classification.

Proposed Solution - Post-to-Post Network:  
- Introduces weighted post-to-post network based on user interactions without requiring user profiling to further enhance results.
- Employs graph neural networks on this network to classify credibility, improving F1 score by 10%.

Main Contributions:
- CREDiBERT model that focuses specifically on source credibility classification over time.
- Method to automatically generate a large paired submission dataset using Reddit's community structure. 
- Innovative user interaction network for enhanced credibility assessment without compromising privacy.
- Evaluation of community susceptibility to misinformation across topics.
