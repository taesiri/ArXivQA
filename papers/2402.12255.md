# [Shallow Synthesis of Knowledge in GPT-Generated Texts: A Case Study in   Automatic Related Work Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is rapid growth in scientific literature, doubling every 14 years in some fields like AI/ML. In response, many AI tools have been developed to aid scholars, including for literature review and writing assistance. 
- However, there has been little formal evaluation of the quality of AI-generated scholarly text. It's important to study this because writing plays a key role in developing understanding, not just disseminating information.

Objective: 
- Present an analysis comparing human-written, GPT-generated, and GPT-assisted related work sections to quantify the ability of AI text to perform synthesis and framing seen in quality academic writing.

Methods:
- Developed ScholaCite, a tool for organizing citations and drafting related work sections using GPT-4. 
- Compared 3 conditions on 10 sample papers: (1) original human-written related work, (2) GPT-assisted, (3) GPT-generated. 
- Proposed evaluation method based on citation graph analysis, where connectivity shows integration and synthesis of cited works. Metrics: number of edges, average node degree, density, clustering coefficient.

Results:  
- Significantly higher connectivity and clustering in human-written texts compared to GPT-generated, suggesting better integration and synthesis.  
- GPT-assisted texts performed at intermediate level, closer to human metrics.

Conclusions:
- Without human intervention, GPT-4 fails to interconnect citations to the degree seen in human-written sections. 
- With guidance and oversight, GPTs may play an assisting role. 
- Future tools should not independently draft full sections to avoid oversimplified/generic discourse.

Contributions:
- ScholaCite system for GPT-assisted writing
- Citation graph analysis for evaluating quality of AI-generated scholarly text
- Insights on appropriate integration of LLMs into research writing process
