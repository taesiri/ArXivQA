## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it tackles is:How can we effectively connect large language models (LLMs) with real-world RESTful APIs to handle complex user instructions?The key points are:- The paper explores connecting LLMs with RESTful APIs, which adhere to a widely adopted standard for web service development. This allows integrating with real-world applications in a scalable way.- The paper proposes RestGPT, a framework to address the challenges of using REST APIs such as understanding API documentation, planning, and parsing responses.- RestGPT employs a coarse-to-fine online planning mechanism to decompose instructions and select APIs. It also contains specialized modules to call APIs and parse responses.- The paper introduces RestBench, a benchmark to evaluate RestGPT on realistic user instructions across two scenarios. Experiments demonstrate RestGPT's effectiveness in utilizing multiple APIs to accomplish complex tasks.In summary, the central research question is how to enable LLMs to understand and leverage real-world RESTful APIs to fulfill practical user instructions. The key contribution is the proposed RestGPT system and evaluation benchmark.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other research in this field:- The paper introduces a new method for connecting large language models with real-world RESTful APIs, which has not been extensively explored before. Most prior work has focused on incorporating tools/APIs specifically designed for LLMs rather than real-world APIs. This allows the proposed method to be more compatible with existing applications.- The coarse-to-fine online planning framework is more flexible compared to offline planning methods used in some prior work. It allows the model to dynamically adjust the plan based on API feedback, enabling it to better handle complex real-world instructions.- The proposed response parser leverages the OpenAPI schema to generate parsing code, facilitating better comprehension of API responses compared to directly prompting the LLM. This is a novel way of exploiting API documentation. - The benchmark RestBench focuses on multi-step instructions requiring orchestrating multiple APIs, unlike some existing benchmarks targeting single API usage. This allows comprehensive evaluation of the model's planning and reasoning abilities.- The experimental results demonstrate strong performance on RestBench, significantly outperforming baseline methods. The analyses also reveal superior robustness in handling varying task complexity and API numbers.Overall, the key novelty lies in the proposed method's effectiveness in connecting LLMs with real-world RESTful APIs. The coarse-to-fine planning and exploitation of API schema differentiates it from prior work. The benchmark and experiments provide evidence that the approach can accomplish complex instructions through coordinating multiple APIs. This advances the capability of LLMs to tackle practical applications.
