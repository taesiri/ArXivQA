# [HRI Curriculum for a Liberal Arts Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a course curriculum for an undergraduate Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) course at a liberal arts college. The goal is to provide an interdisciplinary perspective on HRI that integrates technology and humanities. 

The course covers 6 main themes:
1) Fundamentals of HRI: Definitions of robots and social robots, interaction modalities
2) HRI Design Principles: Key considerations for robots interacting with humans and in society 
3) HRI Technology: Programming and control of robot interactions and behaviors
4) AI for HRI: Use of artificial intelligence to enable/enhance interactions  
5) Additional HRI Topics: Theory of mind, moral implications 
6) HRI Studies: Design and analysis of HRI experiments  

A sample syllabus is provided with details on course format, assignments, schedule, and policies. Assignments include reflections, participation, finding HRI examples in everyday life, mini-projects, and a final group project. The mini-projects build skills needed for the final project, which is to design and possibly execute an HRI experiment. 

The syllabus incorporates several pedagogical strategies: active learning, formative feedback, and elements of Universal Design for Learning. The goal is to develop critical thinking skills and teach both technical knowledge and an appreciation of different cultural perspectives relevant to HRI. Overall, the course is designed to align with the ethos of a liberal arts education.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a sample syllabus for an interdisciplinary undergraduate human-robot interaction course at a liberal arts college, with a focus on integrating technical and humanities perspectives to align with the goals of a liberal arts education.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:

The paper presents a sample syllabus for an undergraduate human-robot interaction (HRI) course at a liberal arts college. The syllabus incorporates interdisciplinary perspectives, ethics, and cultural considerations into the course content and assignments. It provides details on course learning objectives, assignments, major projects, schedule/themes, and pedagogical strategies tailored for a liberal arts environment. The authors make the case that studying HRI from an interdisciplinary, humanistic lens aligns well with the broader goals of a liberal arts education. Overall, the main contribution is a comprehensive sample curriculum for teaching HRI to undergraduate students in a way that connects technology with the humanities.

In summary, the paper offers a useful example syllabus for an interdisciplinary, culturally-aware HRI course at the undergraduate level that emphasizes ethical implications and communication skills alongside technical knowledge. The sample curriculum could serve as a model for developing similar courses at other liberal arts institutions.

The paper discusses developing a human-robot interaction course for undergraduate students at a liberal arts college. It provides a sample syllabus that incorporates interdisciplinary perspectives from fields like engineering, psychology, and philosophy. The learning outcomes, assignments, and pedagogical strategies are designed to align with the goals of a liberal arts education in developing students' skills in connecting information, moral reasoning, and applying knowledge across cultures. Key terms reflect this interdisciplinary and liberal arts focus.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes having students interview international students about the strengths and weaknesses of their robot interaction design. What are some of the ethical considerations with this approach? How can the instructors mitigate any risks?

2. The paper discusses integrating large language models (LLMs) into a robot interaction project. What are some of the technical challenges students may face when working with LLMs? How might the instructors need to scaffold the learning?  

3. The syllabus includes reflections, class activities, HRI in the wild, and several projects. What is the rationale behind having this variety of assignments? How do these assignments complement each other to facilitate diverse learning outcomes?

4. The paper argues that HRI is an ideal course for a liberal arts curriculum. In what ways does the sample syllabus align with the goals of a liberal arts education? What other elements could be incorporated to further these goals?  

5. The final project involves students working in groups to design an HRI experiment. What factors should the instructors consider when forming groups to maximize diverse perspectives and equitable participation?  

6. The paper mentions using Universal Design for Learning principles in the course. How are these principles reflected in the sample syllabus? What other UDL strategies could be used?

7. One of the mini projects is focused on perspectives of robots. What guidance could instructors provide to encourage students to seek out diverse cultural viewpoints during this project?  

8. The syllabus aims to make technical components accessible to students without coding experience. What scaffolding or support systems could help struggling students while still challenging advanced ones?

9. The sample syllabus incorporates several pedagogical strategies like active learning and formative feedback. How do these strategies apply across the different projects and assignments in the course? 

10. The final project allows students to leverage work from previous mini projects. What project workflow or version control system could enable this integration of prior work? What challenges may arise?
