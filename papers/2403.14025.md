## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a course curriculum for an undergraduate Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) course at a liberal arts college. The goal is to provide an interdisciplinary perspective on HRI that integrates technology and humanities. 

The course covers 6 main themes:
1) Fundamentals of HRI: Definitions of robots and social robots, interaction modalities
2) HRI Design Principles: Key considerations for robots interacting with humans and in society 
3) HRI Technology: Programming and control of robot interactions and behaviors
4) AI for HRI: Use of artificial intelligence to enable/enhance interactions  
5) Additional HRI Topics: Theory of mind, moral implications 
6) HRI Studies: Design and analysis of HRI experiments  

A sample syllabus is provided with details on course format, assignments, schedule, and policies. Assignments include reflections, participation, finding HRI examples in everyday life, mini-projects, and a final group project. The mini-projects build skills needed for the final project, which is to design and possibly execute an HRI experiment. 

The syllabus incorporates several pedagogical strategies: active learning, formative feedback, and elements of Universal Design for Learning. The goal is to develop critical thinking skills and teach both technical knowledge and an appreciation of different cultural perspectives relevant to HRI. Overall, the course is designed to align with the ethos of a liberal arts education.
