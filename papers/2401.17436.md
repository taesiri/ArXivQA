# [Difficulty Modelling in Mobile Puzzle Games: An Empirical Study on   Different Methods to Combine Player Analytics and Simulated Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Estimating the difficulty of puzzle game levels is important for keeping players engaged, but current methods have limitations. Specifically, estimating perceived difficulty for individual players and new, unreleased levels is challenging. 

The paper has two main research questions:
1) Can we accurately estimate perceived puzzle level difficulty for individual players, including on new levels?
2) Can we estimate perceived difficulty at a cohort level, again including for new levels?

Proposed Solution: 
The authors test different machine learning methods on commercial puzzle game data to estimate difficulty as the number of attempts to solve a level. They consider "historic data" from previous players, player attributes, level attributes, and simulated playthrough data from a reinforcement learning agent.

They test Factorization Machines (FM), Random Forests (RF), and Neural Networks (NN) with different combinations of data. They evaluate on existing levels and also a "cold start" scenario with no previous play data.

Key Results:
- For individual players on existing levels, FM works best. Additional data doesn't help much.
- For new levels, NN works best for both individual and cohort difficulty, using all data types. FM struggles without historic data.  
- Playtest agent data is necessary to beat baseline performance on new levels.
- Cohort-based estimates on new levels are comparable to aggregated individual estimates.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic analysis of difficulty modeling for puzzle games using different methods and data combinations
- Demonstration that NN can overcome cold start problems and estimate perceived difficulty without historic data
- Finding that playtest agent data is key for new level difficulty estimates
- Showing cohort estimates are feasible for new levels as an alternative to individual estimates

The work provides insights into effectively modeling difficulty in evolving puzzle games for both individual players and cohorts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comparative study of different methods for modeling and predicting perceived difficulty in puzzle games, using player analytics and simulated data from a reinforcement learning agent, finding that models trained on a combination of cohort statistics and simulated data produce the most accurate difficulty estimations across scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Testing and comparing different machine learning methods (factorization machines, random forests, and neural networks) and combinations of data (historic, player, level, agent) for predicting personalized difficulty of puzzle game levels in two scenarios: levels with existing playthrough data and new "cold start" levels.

2) Finding that factorization machines work best for personalized difficulty prediction on existing levels, while neural networks work best for both personalized and average difficulty prediction on new levels. 

3) Showing the importance of using agent simulation data, in addition to player and level data, for accurate difficulty prediction compared to just using a global average.

4) Providing a comparative analysis of difficulty modeling techniques that can serve as a benchmark for future work on predicting difficulty in puzzle games to support tasks like procedural content generation and personalized difficulty adjustment.

In summary, the key contribution is a systematic study of models and data for personalized and average difficulty prediction in puzzle games, with insights on handling cold start scenarios for new content. The results can inform improved difficulty tuning to optimize player engagement and retention.

The paper presents a comparative study on different methods and combinations of data to estimate the perceived difficulty of puzzle game levels, both for individual players (personalized predictions) and on a cohort level. It tests neural networks, random forests, and factorization machines on data from a commercial puzzle game, considering scenarios with and without available historic playthrough data. Key aspects examined are the feasibility and accuracy of difficulty prediction to support game design and procedural content generation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper employs a two-step approach for difficulty modeling that first uses a reinforcement learning agent to extract gameplay data and then trains a prediction model on this data combined with other analytics. What are the rationales behind this two-step approach? What are the limitations?

2. The paper tests three different prediction methods - random forests, neural networks, and factorisation machines. Can you elaborate on the strengths and weaknesses of each method in the context of difficulty prediction? Why might factorisation machines struggle more with cold start problems?  

3. The paper categorizes the data into four types - historic, player, level, and agent data. What is the intuition behind needing different categories of data? What unique information does each category capture regarding difficulty prediction?

4. The reinforcement learning agent is trained separately on each level with a specialized reward function. What is the motivation behind this compared to having one general agent? How might the reward function design impact agent gameplay and the usefulness of extracted analytics?

5. Both personalized and cohort-based difficulty predictions are examined. What are the tradeoffs between these two types of predictions in practice? When would each approach be more suitable to employ?

6. The results show that including agent data is necessary for accurate cold start predictions. Why is simulated gameplay important when no prior player data exists? What biases might an agent have compared to human players?  

7. For personalized predictions, factorisation machines work best on existing content but struggle on new levels. Explain why this difference in performance. How could the cold start problem for factorisation methods potentially be alleviated?

8. The accuracy of the proposed framework is discussed in context of practical usage by level designers. What measures of accuracy are most meaningful? How could the predictions be made more actionable? 

9. The paper examines predicting raw attempt numbers. What are other potential difficulty metrics that could be predicted instead? Would transforming the target variable improve model performance?

10. How could the data splits used in the experiments be altered to better simulate a live environment? What would a true cold start scenario look like as new content gets tested and released?
