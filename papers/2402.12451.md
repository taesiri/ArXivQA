# [The (R)Evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been significant interest in extending them to multimodal domains by incorporating visual modalities. This has led to the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that can process both visual and textual data as inputs and outputs. However, constructing effective MLLMs requires solving challenges around model architecture, training methodologies, evaluation benchmarks, and more. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in visual MLLMs. It reviews various architectural designs, including choices of language models, visual encoders like CLIP and EVA, and adapter modules like linear projections, Q-Former, and cross-attention layers. It discusses single-stage versus two-stage training strategies and analyzes datasets used for instruction tuning. The paper also explores capabilities of MLLMs across tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, visual dialog, and emerging areas like visual grounding, image generation/editing, video understanding, and domain-specific applications. A detailed analysis is provided in terms of model performance across standard and MLLM-specific evaluation benchmarks.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic taxonomy of architectural components, training methodologies, tasks and capabilities of visual MLLMs
- Review of over 40 recent MLLMs summarizing their key details in tables
- Analysis of commonly used training datasets and evaluation benchmarks
- Quantitative comparison of model performance on 14 key benchmarks
- Identification of open challenges around hallucination correction, safety, and compute requirements
- Discussion of promising future directions in this rapidly evolving field

In summary, this paper offers a holistic overview of the current landscape of multimodal LLMs focused on vision-and-language abilities, providing a strong foundation for future research in this exciting field.
