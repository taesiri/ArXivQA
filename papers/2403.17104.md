# [Attribute First, then Generate: Locally-attributable Grounded Text   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large language models (LLMs) still generate factual errors ("hallucinations") compared to source texts, hurting credibility. 
- Existing methods for "attributed text generation" cite full documents/paragraphs, requiring extensive human verification work.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "locally-attributable text generation" with concise, precise attributions to sub-sentence spans.
- Propose "Attribute First, then Generate" approach with 3 steps:
   1) Content selection: Choose relevant details/spans from sources
   2) Sentence planning: Group spans into clusters for sentence fusion 
   3) Sentence generation: Generate sentences based on clusters
- Attributes emerge from initial span selection, guiding output generation.

Main Contributions:  
- First to propose concise, localized attributions in both input and output.
- Decomposes generation into intuitive steps where attribution emerges from content selection.
- Evaluated on summarization and question answering tasks.
- Matches or improves generation quality over baselines.
- Leads to significantly shorter attributions, reducing human verification time by ~50%.
- Opens direction for future work on concise, localized attributions to enhance trustworthiness.

In summary, this paper addresses the problem of coarse attributions in existing models and proposes a novel attributed text generation approach focused on concise, precise attributions integrated throughout the generation process. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the promise of this localization paradigm for efficiently verifying and correcting factual errors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel approach for grounded text generation that provides fine-grained, localized attributions by first selecting relevant content from the input documents, then planning this content into sentence clusters, and finally generating output sentences adhering to these plans, ensuring attribution by design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method for attributable text generation called "Attribute First, Then Generate". The key ideas are:

1) Decomposing the text generation process into separate steps of content selection, sentence planning, and sentence-by-sentence generation. 

2) Using the content selection step to identify relevant source text snippets that will later serve as fine-grained attributions for the generated text.

3) Conditioning the entire downstream generation process on these pre-selected snippets to ensure close adherence of the output text to the attributions.

4) Evaluating the approach on multi-document summarization and long-form question answering tasks, showing it can produce high-quality and accurately-attributed outputs with significantly more concise/localized citations compared to prior attribution methods.

In summary, the paper introduces a new paradigm for accountable text generation that prioritizes fine-grained, sentence-level attributions to facilitate efficient verification, while maintaining strong performance on the generation task itself. The localized attribution is the main novel contribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Locally-attributable text generation - The paper introduces this concept to refer to grounded text generation where attributions are provided at a very granular, localized level, pointing to specific snippets rather than whole documents.

- Attribute First, then Generate - This is the name of the novel attribution-driven text generation approach proposed in the paper. It involves first selecting relevant content, then planning/structuring it, and finally generating output sentences conditioned on the attributed content.

- Concise attributions - The paper emphasizes attributions that are precise and concise, targeting only the minimal set of most relevant snippets needed to support the generated text.

- Multi-document summarization (MDS) - One of the two main tasks used to demonstrate the proposed approach, involving summarizing the content from multiple input documents.

- Long-form question answering (LFQA) - The second main task used to showcase the approach, generating detailed responses to questions based on input documents. 

- Content selection, sentence planning, sentence generation - The three main steps of the Attribute First, then Generate framework.

- In-context learning, fine-tuning - Two main strategies explored for implementing the approach, using prompt-based few-shot learning and supervised fine-tuning of components.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes decomposing the text generation process into three steps: content selection, sentence planning, and sentence-by-sentence generation. What is the rationale behind structuring the process this way? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks?

2. The content selection step involves extracting relevant snippets from the source texts to serve as the foundation for the output. What criteria and techniques does the paper use to identify salient content for tasks like summarization and question answering? How could this selection process be improved?

3. The paper uses specialized prompts and demonstrations to guide large language models through the process in an in-context learning setup. What is the motivation behind this decision and what are some of the prompt design considerations outlined? How does this compare to directly fine-tuning models?

4. The sentence planning component clusters the selected content into sentence-level groupings to facilitate attribution and coherent sentence fusion. What formatting conventions and constraints does the paper impose during this step? What room is there to enhance the clustering mechanisms?  

5. During the final generation step, what conditioning information is provided to models in the paper in order to improve output coherence while adhering to attributions? Are there potentially other signals that could further enhance fluency and faithfulness?

6. The paper introduces a Chain-of-Thought variation that interleaves the planning and generation steps. What motivates this design and how does neatly integrate attribution? What are its tradeoffs compared to the non-Chain-of-Thought approach?

7. Beyond the specific tasks analyzed, to what degree is the overall framework proposed in the paper adaptable to other text generation domains? What components would need to be customized?

8. The paper demonstrates gains on attribution granularity but what analysis is provided regarding the impact on computational efficiency? What is the theoretical time and space complexity of the approach and is there room for optimization?  

9. While automatic metrics show promising results, what are the specific findings from the paper's human evaluations? What potential gaps exist between human and automated assessments of attribution quality?

10. What limitations does the paper acknowledge regarding the approach and what potential negative societal impacts may warrant further investigation before wide-scale deployment of such attribution mechanisms?
