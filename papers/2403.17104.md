# [Attribute First, then Generate: Locally-attributable Grounded Text   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large language models (LLMs) still generate factual errors ("hallucinations") compared to source texts, hurting credibility. 
- Existing methods for "attributed text generation" cite full documents/paragraphs, requiring extensive human verification work.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "locally-attributable text generation" with concise, precise attributions to sub-sentence spans.
- Propose "Attribute First, then Generate" approach with 3 steps:
   1) Content selection: Choose relevant details/spans from sources
   2) Sentence planning: Group spans into clusters for sentence fusion 
   3) Sentence generation: Generate sentences based on clusters
- Attributes emerge from initial span selection, guiding output generation.

Main Contributions:  
- First to propose concise, localized attributions in both input and output.
- Decomposes generation into intuitive steps where attribution emerges from content selection.
- Evaluated on summarization and question answering tasks.
- Matches or improves generation quality over baselines.
- Leads to significantly shorter attributions, reducing human verification time by ~50%.
- Opens direction for future work on concise, localized attributions to enhance trustworthiness.

In summary, this paper addresses the problem of coarse attributions in existing models and proposes a novel attributed text generation approach focused on concise, precise attributions integrated throughout the generation process. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the promise of this localization paradigm for efficiently verifying and correcting factual errors.
