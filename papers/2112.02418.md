# [YourTTS: Towards Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker TTS and Zero-Shot Voice   Conversion for everyone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02418)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses seem to be:

- Can a multilingual approach enable zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and voice conversion in a target language using only a single speaker dataset from that language? 

- Can a model trained on multiple languages achieve state-of-the-art results in zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and voice conversion for English?

- Can a model pretrained on multiple speakers and languages be effectively adapted to new speakers with very little speech data (less than 1 minute)?

Specifically, the authors propose a multilingual TTS model called YourTTS that builds on prior work like VITS. Their key contributions seem to be:

1) Showing that their model can achieve promising zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and voice conversion in a new language after training on just a single speaker dataset in that language. 

2) Demonstrating state-of-the-art results on zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and voice conversion for English by training on speakers from multiple languages.

3) Introducing speaker adaptation techniques requiring less than 1 minute of speech that can effectively adapt their pretrained multilingual model to new voices.

Overall, their main research questions revolve around leveraging multilingual training data and transfer learning techniques to enable effective zero-shot multi-speaker synthesis and voice conversion, even for low-resource languages with limited data. The paper aims to show the potential of their proposed YourTTS model in this context.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper presents a multilingual approach to zero-shot multi-speaker TTS, which is a novel contribution. Most prior work on zero-shot TTS has focused on a single language, usually English. The idea of leveraging multiple languages to improve generalization to new voices is interesting.

- The proposed method builds on recent advances in zero-shot TTS like the VITS model, but makes modifications for multilingual training. Using an H/ASP speaker encoder and raw text input rather than phonemes are notable changes compared to prior models.

- The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and voice conversion for English VCTK. This advances the state-of-the-art for this standard benchmark dataset.

- Showing the ability to do zero-shot TTS and voice conversion in Portuguese with just one speaker is an important result. This could enable extending these capabilities to lower resource languages.

- The speaker adaptation results with less than 1 minute of speech are promising and could make these models more practical for new voices. Most prior work requires more enrollment data.

- One limitation compared to some prior work is less focus on controllable prosody. The stochastic duration predictor may produce less natural rhythms at times. 

- The proposed model still requires a fairly large diversity of voices for solid generalization. Performance drops noticeably when reducing the number of speakers.

Overall, this paper demonstrates solid improvements to zero-shot TTS, especially for the multilingual use case. The results are state-of-the-art for seen speakers on VCTK, and generalization is good but still limited for voices very different from the training data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improvements to the duration predictor of the YourTTS model to make it more stable and generate more natural durations. The authors mention the duration predictor currently has some instability issues for certain speakers/sentences.

- Training the model on more languages beyond just English, Portuguese, and French. Expanding to more languages would allow testing the multilingual capabilities further.

- Exploring the use of this model for data augmentation in training automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, especially in low-resource languages. The authors suggest the model could be used to synthesize more varied training data.

- Using phoneme inputs instead of raw text. The authors note some mispronunciation issues occurred, especially in Portuguese, due to not using phonetic transcriptions. Switching to phonemic input could help alleviate this.

- Further improvements to speaker adaptation with very limited target speaker data. While the model shows promising adaptation capabilities with <1 minute of speech, the authors note even better quality may be achieved with more data such as >45 seconds.

- Analysis of gender effects in voice conversion. The authors found voice conversion was significantly affected by gender for Portuguese due to lack of female voices in training data. More analysis in this area is suggested.

In summary, the main future directions are enhancing the model capabilities in multilingual training, stability, pronunciation, speaker adaptation, and analyzing gender effects in voice conversion. Expanding the model to more languages and scenarios is a key goal.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) called YourTTS. The method builds on the VITS model and adds novel modifications for zero-shot multi-speaker and multilingual training.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes a new approach called YourTTS for zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech synthesis and voice conversion. The model builds on VITS but includes several novel modifications for multilingual training. A transformer-based text encoder is used with added language embeddings for multilingual capability. The decoder uses affine coupling layers and WaveNet residual blocks. HiFi-GAN is used as the vocoder and connected to the model using a variational autoencoder for end-to-end training. Speaker embeddings are conditioned throughout the model for zero-shot capability. Stochastic duration prediction enables diverse rhythms. 

The model achieves state-of-the-art results on the VCTK dataset for both zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and voice conversion. It shows promising capability for zero-shot TTS and voice conversion in a new language using just a single speaker dataset in that language. This could enable development of such systems in low-resource languages. The model can also be fine-tuned for new speakers using very little adaptation data, down to 20 seconds, and still produce good similarity and naturalness. Some limitations include instability in duration prediction and mispronunciations in certain languages. Overall, YourTTS demonstrates strong capabilities for zero-shot multispeaker and multilingual speech synthesis and voice conversion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes YourTTS, a multilingual text-to-speech model based on VITS that incorporates several novel modifications for zero-shot multi-speaker and multilingual training. The model uses a transformer-based text encoder with added language embeddings, a flow-based decoder conditioned on external speaker embeddings, and a HiFi-GAN vocoder connected via a variational autoencoder. For zero-shot capabilities, speaker embeddings from a pre-trained model are provided during synthesis. The model is trained end-to-end on speech from multiple languages, using weighted sampling for language balancing. Several experiments are presented training on English (VCTK), Portuguese and French speech, both individually and jointly. The method is evaluated for zero-shot multi-speaker TTS and voice conversion capabilities using objective metrics (SECS, MOS, Sim-MOS) on held-out test sets. Additional experiments demonstrate speaker adaptation with very limited target speaker data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is how to enable zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech synthesis and zero-shot voice conversion for a diverse range of speakers, including those not seen during training. 

Some key questions the paper seems to be tackling:

- How can we build a TTS model that can generate natural sounding speech in the voices of new speakers, without needing to directly train on data from those speakers? This is known as "zero-shot multi-speaker TTS".

- How can we do zero-shot multi-speaker TTS not just for speakers of the languages seen during training, but even for new languages with limited data? 

- How can we enable "zero-shot voice conversion" - converting speech from one speaker to sound like another new speaker not seen during training?

- How can the model rapidly adapt to new speakers with very different voices or recording conditions using just small amounts of adaptation data?

- How can all this be achieved in a multilingual model trained on multiple languages simultaneously?

So in summary, the key focus seems to be on overcoming the limitation that TTS and voice conversion models typically require data from target speakers, by developing techniques for zero-shot generalization to new speakers, languages and recording conditions. The proposed model "YourTTS" aims to tackle these challenges.
