# [Snap Video: Scaled Spatiotemporal Transformers for Text-to-Video   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14797)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current video generation models are adaptations of image models and thus do not properly handle the temporal dimension of videos. This leads to motion artifacts, flickering, and lack of long-term coherence. 
- Widely used UNet architectures require processing each frame independently, limiting scalability and joint spatio-temporal modeling.

Method:
- Propose a video-centric reformulation of EDM diffusion framework that handles redundant info across frames and higher input resolution. Maintains original SNR across frames.
- Introduce a highly scalable transformer architecture based on FITs that jointly models videos in space and time via a learned compressed representation. Allows scaling to billions of params.

Contributions:
- Video-focused diffusion model avoids modality mismatch between images and videos. Matches image/video training.
- FIT architecture trains 3.3x faster and infers 4.5x faster than UNets while achieving better performance.
- Scale model to 3.9B parameters, enables high quality output. State-of-the-art on UCF101 and MSR-VTT.
- User studies show method produces more coherent motion and better text-video alignment than recent methods.

In summary, this paper presents a video-first model for text-to-video generation that through architectural and modeling improvements, achieves new state-of-the-art performance for temporally coherent and scalable synthesis aligned with text prompts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new text-to-video generation method called Snap Video that uses a scaled spatiotemporal transformer architecture to achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of training speed, scalability, temporal consistency, motion modeling capabilities, and alignment between text prompts and synthesized videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing modifications to the EDM diffusion framework to make it more suitable for high-resolution video generation, by accounting for redundancies between video frames and treating images as high frame rate videos. 

2. Introducing a new scalable transformer architecture based on FITs that can efficiently model videos by jointly representing the spatial and temporal dimensions in a compressed latent space. This architecture trains much faster than prior video generation models based on U-Nets.

3. Scaling up this architecture to billions of parameters and showing it can generate high quality, temporally consistent videos with complex motion better than prior state-of-the-art methods.

4. Performing comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrating the proposed method, named Snap Video, achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like UCF-101 and MSR-VTT, especially on metrics related to motion quality.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a video-first framework including modifications to the diffusion process and a new scalable transformer architecture that can generate higher quality and more temporally consistent videos compared to prior arts.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose modifying the EDM diffusion framework to better handle high-resolution videos. What is the key modification they make and what is the motivation behind it? How does it help maintain the optimal signal-to-noise ratio?

7. What modifications were made to the vanilla FIT architecture to better handle high-resolution video modeling? How do these modifications aim to improve temporal consistency and motion complexity?

8. The diffusion framework is designed to maintain optimal signal-to-noise ratios when handling videos. Walk through the analysis in Figure 1 and explain how averaging frames can change this ratio.
