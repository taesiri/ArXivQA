# [Jurassic is (almost) All You Need: Few-Shot Meaning-to-Text Generation   for Open-Domain Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08094)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can few-shot prompt-based learning create high-quality, semantically-controlled natural language generators (NLGs) for open-domain dialogue systems? 2) Can few-shot prompting allow language models like GPT-Neo and Jurassic-1 to generate conversational responses directly from meaning representations (MRs) that generalize well to new domains and unseen entities/relations?3) How does the quality and coverage of neural NLGs created via prompt-based learning compare to existing template-based NLGs for movies, music, sports, TV, and video games in the Alexa Prize dialogue system Athena?4) Can few-shot prompting control the dialogue acts realized in generated responses, when the meaning representations specify dialogue acts like in the Viggo dataset?5) How well do automatic metrics like BLEURT correlate with human evaluations of coherence and semantic accuracy for prompt-based NLGs?The central hypothesis appears to be that few-shot prompt-based learning can reliably create high-quality NLGs for open-domain dialogue systems, that generalize across domains and meaning representations. The experiments seem designed to test this hypothesis by evaluating both automatic and human metrics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing and evaluating neural natural language generation models for open-domain dialogue systems using few-shot prompt-based learning. Specifically:- The authors create two new neural NLG models, Athena-GPT-Neo and Athena-Jurassic, by fine-tuning large pre-trained language models (GPT-Neo and Jurassic-1) using few-shot prompting on datasets derived from an existing dialogue system called Athena.- They experiment with different prompting strategies, including varying the number of shots (2, 3, 10), prompt formats (QA vs sequence-to-sequence), and meaning representations (KG triples vs dialogue acts). - The models are evaluated both automatically using BLEURT and via human evaluation on coherence, semantic accuracy, and other metrics. - Key results show that with 10-shot prompting, both models produce coherent outputs, but Athena-Jurassic performs significantly better on human metrics. Also, Athena-Jurassic generalizes remarkably well even with just 2-shot prompting on unseen entities and relations.- The authors demonstrate that few-shot prompt-based learning can create high-quality, semantically controlled NLG models that generalize across domains, which could be useful for dialogue systems.In summary, the main contribution is using few-shot prompting to create neural NLG models for open-domain dialogue that can generate natural, accurate, and conversational responses directly from meaning representations. The results suggest this approach could help improve the coverage and quality of data-to-text generation in dialogue systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper experiments with few-shot prompt-based learning using GPT-Neo and Jurassic-1 to create neural natural language generators for open-domain dialogue systems, showing that models like Jurassic-1 can produce high-quality, semantically-controlled responses directly from meaning representations with minimal tuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper on few-shot meaning-to-text generation to other recent work in natural language generation:- The paper focuses on applying few-shot learning to build neural language generators for open-domain dialogue systems. This contrasts with much recent work on fine-tuning large pre-trained language models, which requires more training data and compute. The few-shot approach allows creating models for new domains more efficiently.- The authors test two state-of-the-art large language models, GPT-Neo and Jurassic-1, for few-shot learning. This continues a trend in NLP of leveraging advances in pre-trained language models for downstream tasks like dialogue generation.- The paper examines few-shot learning both within and across domains, using WikiData knowledge graph triples and dialogue acts as meaning representations. Testing cross-domain generalization is still relatively rare in dialogue research.- The authors compare multiple prompt formats for conditioning the language models, finding differences in what works best for GPT-Neo vs Jurassic-1. This highlights the impact of prompt engineering, which is an active area of investigation.- The human evaluation and analysis of outputs looks at nuanced metrics like coherence, accuracy, and different types of hallucinations. This provides a more fine-grained view than just BLEU or perplexity scores. - To my knowledge, this is the first work showing successful few-shot learning for controllable neural generation directly from meaning representations like dialogue acts and knowledge graph triples. This could open up new possibilities for rapidly creating dialogue systems.Overall, the paper makes excellent contributions in systematically exploring few-shot learning for dialogue generation, comparing models, generalizing across domains, analyzing outputs, and demonstrating promising results on a challenging task. The results look very positive for the potential of using few-shot prompting to efficiently build high-quality conversational AI systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Evaluate the cross-domain results with human metrics, since the paper mainly focused on within-domain experiments. This could provide insight into how well the models generalize across domains with few-shot prompting.- Experiment with more challenging test sets using novel entities and relations, as was done in the 2-shot experiments. This could further test the models' ability to generalize.- Try other recently proposed automatic evaluation metrics beyond BLEURT to see if they correlate better with human judgments of quality. Many new metrics evaluate outputs in dialogue context.- Explore additional prompting variations with the WikiData and Viggo datasets that were not fully tested yet, such as different numbers of shots or mixing domains in the prompts.- Apply the approach to other NLG problems like improving fluency, reducing repetition, and controlling personality or style. The models showed promise for semantic control.- Evaluate whether real-time response generation is feasible with these models to determine if they could be deployed in live systems.- Improve the Viggo results to match the high performance achieved on the WikiData domains, since the dialogue act control was not as strong.In summary, the main suggestions are to further test generalization, explore additional prompting regimes, apply the approach to other NLG challenges, and improve the dialogue act control results. The authors see promise in using few-shot prompting for high-quality semantic control in open-domain dialogue systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores using few-shot prompt-based learning to create natural language generators for open-domain dialogue systems. The authors experiment with using the models GPT-Neo and Jurassic-1 to generate responses for movies, music, TV, sports, and video games topics, based on input meaning representations consisting of WikiData knowledge graph triples or dialogue acts. They compare few-shot prompting within and across domains and with different prompt set sizes, formats, and meaning representations. The models are evaluated using BLEURT and human metrics. Results show that with 10-shot prompting, Jurassic-1 generates significantly better outputs in terms of coherence and accuracy. Experiments also demonstrate that Jurassic-1 generalizes better to new domains with just 2-shot prompting. Overall, the study demonstrates that few-shot prompt-based learning can produce high-quality, semantically-controlled responses for open-domain dialogue systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents experiments with few-shot prompt-based learning to create new neural models for semantically-controlled natural language generation. The goal is to improve the quality and coverage of meaning-to-text response generators in Athena, an open-domain dialog system. The authors create Athena-GPT-Neo and Athena-Jurassic using GPT-Neo and Jurassic-1 models. They perform few-shot prompting experiments on two datasets: Athena's knowledge graph response generators for movies, music, TV, and sports; and the Viggo video game corpus. The prompts consist of meaning representations paired with responses. The results show that with 10-shot prompting, both models produce coherent outputs, but Athena-Jurassic performs significantly better on coherence and semantic accuracy. Experiments with 2-shot cross-domain prompting reveal a large performance drop for Athena-GPT-Neo. Experiments on controlling dialogue acts with Viggo show that both models can learn this with 10-shot prompting, but Athena-Jurassic again has higher coherence. The authors conclude that their approach demonstrates that few-shot prompting can create high-quality semantically controlled natural language generation models that generalize to new domains.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper explores using few-shot prompt-based learning to create new neural natural language generation (NLG) models for generating responses in an open-domain dialogue system. The authors utilize two large language models, GPT-Neo and Jurassic-1, and tune them on small sets of 2, 3 or 10 examples that pair meaning representations (MRs) with desired responses. The MRs come from two sources: knowledge graph triples about movies, music, sports, and TV, and dialogue acts with slot values for video games. They test prompt tuning both within and across domains, and with semantic MRs versus more abstract dialogue acts. The models are evaluated both automatically with BLEURT and via human judgments of coherence, accuracy, and hallucinations. The results show that with 10-shot prompting, both models can generate coherent and accurate responses, but Jurassic-1 significantly outperforms GPT-Neo on human metrics. The method demonstrates that prompt-based tuning enables few-shot learning of high quality neural NLG models that can generalize across domains.
