# [GALAXY: A Generative Pre-trained Model for Task-Oriented Dialog with   Semi-Supervised Learning and Explicit Policy Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14592)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How to effectively inject explicit dialog policy knowledge into pre-trained conversational models, in order to improve their performance on downstream task-oriented dialog tasks?

Specifically, the paper proposes a new pre-training approach called GALAXY that incorporates dialog act prediction as an auxiliary task during pre-training, to explicitly model dialog policy. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Designs a unified dialog act taxonomy and collects a new labeled dataset UniDA for pre-training.

- Proposes a semi-supervised pre-training paradigm that combines consistency regularization on unlabeled data and supervision from dialog act prediction on labeled data. This allows incorporating policy knowledge from limited labeled data while leveraging large unlabeled corpora. 

- Implements a gating mechanism to automatically select high-quality unlabeled dialog samples for consistency training.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on several task-oriented dialog benchmarks like MultiWOZ 2.0/2.1. Shows stronger few-shot ability than previous models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that incorporating explicit dialog policy modeling via semi-supervised pre-training can improve the performance of conversational models on downstream task-oriented dialog applications. The GALAXY model with the proposed pre-training approach is presented as a method to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog model that can explicitly learn dialog policy from limited labeled dialogs and large-scale unlabeled dialog corpora via semi-supervised learning. 

2. It designs a unified dialog act (DA) taxonomy and collects a new labeled dataset UniDA for dialog policy modeling in the pre-training stage.

3. It introduces a consistency regularization loss on unlabeled dialog data to facilitate better representation learning. A gating mechanism is also proposed to weigh suitable unlabeled samples.

4. Experiments show GALAXY achieves new state-of-the-art results on several task-oriented dialog benchmarks like MultiWOZ 2.0 and 2.1. It also has stronger few-shot ability than previous models under low-resource settings.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog model for task-oriented dialog that explicitly learns dialog policy via semi-supervised learning on a labeled dialog dataset UniDA and large-scale unlabeled dialog corpus UnDial, and achieves state-of-the-art results on several task-oriented dialog benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of task-oriented dialog systems and pre-trained conversational models:

- This paper proposes a new semi-supervised pre-training approach that explicitly models dialog policy by incorporating a dialog act (DA) prediction task. Most prior work on pre-trained conversational models focuses on improving dialog understanding and generation capabilities, without explicitly modeling dialog policy. 

- The proposed model, GALAXY, learns dialog policy from both limited labeled dialog data and large amounts of unlabeled dialog data via a consistency regularization approach. This allows it to leverage DA annotations without requiring full supervision. Other semi-supervised dialog policy learning methods rely more heavily on user simulators or latent variable models.

- The paper collects and releases two new dialog datasets - UniDA (labeled) and UnDial (unlabeled) to facilitate research on semi-supervised dialog policy learning for pre-training. Many prior works use existing datasets like Reddit, but do not tailor datasets specifically for this task.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on MultiWOZ, In-Car, and other benchmarks by explicitly incorporating policy modeling into pre-training. Most prior pre-trained conversational models do not focus on optimizing policy-related metrics.

- Analysis shows GALAXY has stronger few-shot ability than prior models, reducing the reliance on large labeled datasets. Other pre-trained models exhibit decent few-shot learning for dialog language tasks but less analysis on few-shot policy learning.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel pre-training paradigm tailored for task-oriented dialog that focuses on policy modeling, leverages semi-supervised learning, and shows improved few-shot capability over prior work. The new datasets could serve as useful resources for future research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more sophisticated pre-training objectives that can better model core abilities like understanding, planning, and generation in dialog systems. The authors suggest exploring new self-supervised objectives tailored for dialog as well as leveraging more available labels like dialog acts.

- Exploring different model architectures and representations for dialog modeling, such as hierarchical or graph-based models to capture discourse relations and long-term contexts. 

- Scaling up the pre-training with even larger datasets and models. The authors suggest pre-training could benefit from billions of dialogs with larger transformer models.

- Utilizing external knowledge more effectively during pre-training, such as through knowledge graphs or unstructured knowledge retrieved from the web.

- Multi-task learning and multi-objective training paradigms that combine various dialog-related tasks like understanding, generation, retrieval etc. in a single pre-training framework.

- Continued benchmarking on existing and more challenging/realistic dialog datasets to better evaluate model capabilities. The authors suggest collecting human evaluations and task-oriented dialog datasets in new domains.

- Exploring methods like adversarial training and data augmentation to make models more robust and reduce overfitting.

In summary, the main future directions are developing better pre-training objectives and representations tailored for dialog, scaling up pre-training data and models, incorporating external knowledge, multi-task learning, evaluation benchmarking, and improving model robustness.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog model that learns dialog policy explicitly during pre-training via semi-supervised learning. The authors first build a unified dialog act taxonomy and collect a new labeled dataset UniDA as well as a large unlabeled dialog corpus UnDial. Then they introduce a dialog act prediction task to model dialog policy and use consistency regularization to learn better representations from unlabeled data. Specifically, they minimize the bidirectional KL-divergence between model predictions made on dropout-perturbed samples to regularize the model. They also implement a gating mechanism to select suitable unlabeled samples. 

Experiments show that GALAXY substantially improves task-oriented dialog systems and achieves new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks including MultiWOZ 2.0, MultiWOZ 2.1 and In-Car. For example, it improves the combined score on MultiWOZ 2.0 by 5.3 points. GALAXY also demonstrates stronger few-shot ability than previous models under low-resource settings.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog model that incorporates explicit dialog policy learning during pre-training via a semi-supervised learning approach. The authors first build a unified dialog act (DA) taxonomy and a labeled dataset UniDA based on aligning and unifying annotations from multiple existing datasets. They also collect a large unlabeled dialog dataset UnDial. For pre-training, GALAXY is initialized with UniLM and trained on both UniDA and UnDial. A DA prediction task is added as a supervised objective on UniDA to learn dialog policy. For UnDial, a consistency regularization term is used to minimize the KL divergence between outputs from the model with different dropout noise, which helps learn useful representations from unlabeled data. A gating mechanism is also proposed to weigh the unlabeled samples based on their suitability for DA prediction. After pre-training, GALAXY is fine-tuned on downstream dialog tasks. The semi-supervised pre-training approach allows GALAXY to leverage both labeled DA annotations and unlabeled dialogs to learn improved representations that integrate explicit dialog policy knowledge.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper titled "GALAXY: A Generative Pre-trained Model for Task-Oriented Dialog with Semi-Supervised Learning and Explicit Policy Injection" addresses the problem of how to effectively incorporate dialog policy knowledge into pre-trained conversational models (PCMs) for task-oriented dialog systems. 

The key questions and goals of this paper are:

- How to exploit dialog policy, often formulated as dialog act (DA) prediction, in the pre-training stage to learn better representations for downstream task-oriented dialog tasks? 

- How to utilize limited labeled DA data and large amounts of unlabeled dialog data to pre-train the model via semi-supervised learning?

- How to design a model that can explicitly capture dialog policy while maintaining strong abilities for dialog understanding and generation?

- The goal is to develop a pre-trained model called GALAXY that incorporates dialog policy information to achieve better performance on task-oriented dialog systems with limited supervision.

In summary, the paper aims to address the lack of explicit dialog policy modeling in current PCM pre-training methods by proposing a novel model GALAXY that learns policy via DA prediction and semi-supervised learning on both labeled and unlabeled dialog data.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog model that learns dialog policy explicitly during pre-training via semi-supervised learning. The model introduces a unified dialog act taxonomy with 20 labels and collects a labeled dataset UniDA (975K utterances) as well as a large unlabeled dataset UnDial (35M utterances).
