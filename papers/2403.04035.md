# [Personalizing explanations of AI-driven hints to users cognitive   abilities: an empirical evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explanations can improve users' understanding and trust in AI systems, but their effectiveness depends on individual user characteristics (UCs). 
- Prior work showed students with low Need for Cognition (N4C) and Conscientiousness don't naturally engage with explanations from an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), yet could benefit if they did.

Proposed Solution:
- Personalize explanations from the Adaptive CSP (ACSP) ITS applet to encourage more interaction for low N4C and Conscientiousness (LNLC) students. 
- Present first explanation page automatically with hints (upfront delivery).
- Add confirmation box that warns students not to exit explanations too quickly.

Contributions:
- Implemented and evaluated personalized explanations based on UCs, extending very limited prior work.
- Focused on interactive, multi-page explanations for a complex, cognitively demanding task (learning).
- Showed personalized explanations significantly increased LNLC students' interaction with explanations, understanding of hints, and learning gains.
- Identified areas for improvement: reduce distraction of upfront delivery, increase usefulness of confirmation box.
- Provided further evidence for benefits of personalized Explainable AI based on UCs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates personalizing the explanations of hints generated by an intelligent tutoring system to encourage increased interaction for students with low need for cognition and conscientiousness, finding the personalization significantly increases these students' interaction with, understanding of, and learning from the explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting and evaluating a personalized explanation interface for an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) called the ACSP applet. Specifically:

- The paper personalizes the explanations provided by the ACSP applet to justify the hints it generates. The personalization targets students with low levels of Need for Cognition (N4C) and Conscientiousness.

- The goal of the personalization is to increase these students' engagement with the explanations, as prior work found they do not naturally engage with them but could benefit if they do. 

- The personalization involves delivering the first explanation page upfront with each hint (instead of waiting for users to click a button) and using confirmation prompts to warn students if they try to exit the explanations too quickly.

- Through a user study, the paper shows the personalized explanations significantly increase target users' interaction with explanations, understanding of hints, and learning gains.

- The paper contributes further evidence on the importance of personalized explainable AI, involving interactive and complex explanations provided during a cognitively demanding task like learning.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting and empirically evaluating a personalized explanation interface for an ITS that increases target users' engagement, understanding, and learning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Explainable AI (XAI)
- Personalized explanations
- Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) 
- User characteristics (UCs)
- Need for Cognition (N4C)
- Conscientiousness  
- Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)
- User study 
- Interaction with explanations
- Learning gains
- Perceived understanding of hints

The paper investigates personalizing the explanations provided by an ITS called the ACSP applet to justify the hints it generates. The personalization targets students with low N4C and Conscientiousness and aims to increase their engagement with the explanations. A user study is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this personalization in terms of measures like interaction with explanations, learning gains, and perceived understanding of hints. So these are some of the central keywords and terminology related to this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes personalizing explanations for students with low levels of which two traits, and why were these two traits chosen? What were the prior findings that motivated targeting students with low levels of these traits?

2. What two main modifications were made to the original explanation interface in order to increase user interaction with the explanations? Can you describe these modifications in detail? 

3. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of the personalized explanation interface using both objective performance measures and subjective perception measures. What were the specific objective and subjective measures used?

4. When analyzing the effects of the personalized explanation interface on interaction, the paper looks at access to the first explanation page separately from access to subsequent pages. Why was this done, given the differences in how the first page was accessed between the control and experimental groups?

5. The confirmation box added to the personalized explanation interface was found not to be very effective. What reasons for this result were uncovered upon further analysis? How could the confirmation box be improved to address these issues?

6. Although users of the personalized explanation interface showed increased learning gains, their subjective ratings for the explanations were worse than the control group on some dimensions. What were the specific dimensions rated worse, and what reasons behind these poor ratings were uncovered in the post-study interviews?  

7. The paper hypothesizes a possible relationship between amount of user engagement with the explanations and resulting learning gains. What analysis was done to investigate this potential relationship and what were the results? How could this relationship be further studied?

8. What longer term goals for improving and extending the personalized explanation interface are discussed at the end of the paper? What specific next steps are mentioned?

9. Could the personalized explanation delivery method proposed negatively impact some users? What issues were uncovered that could contribute to user distraction or confusion? How might these issues be addressed?

10. How does this work build upon and extend previous works on personalized explainable AI? What makes the context and explanations studied here more complex than in some prior works?
