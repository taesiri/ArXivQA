## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Globally Stable Neural Imitation Policies":

Problem: 
Imitation learning methods can accurately replicate expert demonstrations but often exhibit unpredictability when facing perturbations, raising safety concerns. Prior methods ensure stability through Lyapunov or contraction theories but have limitations in scalability, computational complexity, non-convex optimization, and sample efficiency.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Stable Neural Dynamical Systems (SNDS) to efficiently train scalable and globally stable neural policies for imitation learning. SNDS represents policies with a neural dynamical system and a Lyapunov function to ensure stability. It uses a feedforward neural network for the policy and an input convex neural network for the Lyapunov function. The policy network is projected to satisfy Lyapunov stability conditions. A differentiable loss function is proposed to align policy rollouts with expert demonstrations while limiting computational complexity.

Main Contributions:
- Design of a stable-by-design neural representation for globally stable nonlinear policies based on expert demonstrations
- Formal stability analysis using Lyapunov theory and convex neural networks
- Formulation of a differentiable trajectory alignment loss function using forward Euler's method
- Empirical evaluation showing SNDS's effectiveness for complex trajectories in high-dimensional spaces, in simulation and on a real robot manipulator  

In summary, the paper presents SNDS, a method to learn scalable and globally stable neural policies through imitation learning. By representing policies with neural networks and guaranteeing stability through Lyapunov conditions, SNDS addresses key challenges of accuracy, safety, scalability and computational complexity compared to prior imitation learning techniques.
