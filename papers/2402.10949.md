# [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10949)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance improvements from small changes to prompts, but tuning prompts by hand is inefficient. This paper explores whether trivial "positive thinking" prompt additions can boost LLM math performance, and whether automatic prompt optimization outperforms manual tuning.

Methods
- Tested 60 prompt variations with 3 LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B) on the GSM8K math dataset, with and without Chain of Thought prompting. Prompts combined "positive thinking" openers, task descriptions, and closers.
- Compared best "positive thinking" prompts to prompts auto-generated by DSPy optimizers for each LLM and question subset (10, 25, 50, 100 questions).
- Used exact match accuracy as main evaluation metric.

Results
- With Chain of Thought, "positive thinking" prompts outperformed no prompt baseline. Without Chain of Thought, models exhibited prompt invariance.
- Llama2-70B performed best with no prompt at all when not using Chain of Thought.
- Auto-optimized prompts outperformed best "positive thinking" prompts in nearly all cases, especially for larger Llama2 models.
- Auto-optimized prompts exhibited peculiar, unexpected wording but still achieved top performance.

Conclusions
- No universal "positive thinking" prompt exists to improve all LLMs. Performance improvements don't generalize across models.
- Automated optimization is substantially more effective for prompt tuning than manual iteration.
- Surprisingly eccentric optimized prompts can unlock unexpected performance gains.

The paper underscores the sensitivity of LLMs to small prompt changes and advocates for automated optimization over manual prompt engineering.
