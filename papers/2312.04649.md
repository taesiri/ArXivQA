# [PyThaiNLP: Thai Natural Language Processing in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04649)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Thai language lacked a comprehensive open-source natural language processing (NLP) toolkit compared to high-resource languages like English and Chinese. Existing tools were limited in scope, access, documentation and maintenance. This affected reproducibility and forced researchers to spend time building basic components instead of advancing the field.

Proposed Solution - PyThaiNLP:  
- PyThaiNLP is introduced as a free and open-source Python-based NLP library for Thai language released in 2016. 
- It provides a wide range of functionalities spanning from tokenization, POS tagging, NER, spell checking to machine translation and speech recognition.
- The library also releases datasets and pre-trained models like word embeddings and transformer models to support Thai NLP tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Created an open-source one-stop toolkit covering most Thai NLP capabilities, inspired by English NLTK.
- Released models and datasets including a RoBERTa-based model, English-Thai translation dataset, NER dataset etc.
- Fostered an engaged community of over 16,000 Thai NLP researchers and practitioners contributing to the project. 
- Showcased real-world use cases in major Thai firms where PyThaiNLP increased efficiency and business metrics across banking, telecom, retail and insurance sectors.
- Set foundations for democratizing and advancing Thai NLP through open-source code, models and community building. Next steps involve domain-specific resources, benchmarks and tighter integration with language-agnostic NLP libraries.
