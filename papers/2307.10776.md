# [Urban Radiance Field Representation with Deformable Neural Mesh   Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10776)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that a neural radiance field representation based on deformable neural mesh primitives can achieve high quality view synthesis for large outdoor urban scenes in an efficient manner. 

Some key points:

- The paper proposes representing complex outdoor scenes using a collection of deformable neural mesh primitives (DNMPs). Each DNMP captures the geometry and radiance of a local region.

- The geometry of each DNMP is controlled by a low-dimensional latent code, which is optimized to deform the mesh and capture the local 3D structure. This allows efficiently optimizing the geometry.

- The radiance is captured by features associated with each mesh vertex, which can be rendered efficiently via rasterization. 

- The scene is hierarchically represented with DNMPs at multiple scales to handle noise and missing regions in the input 3D reconstruction.

- Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis results on urban datasets much more efficiently than vanilla NeRF and other baselines.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed DNMP representation can achieve high quality radiance field modeling and rendering for large outdoor scenes in an efficient manner compared to prior work. The key ideas are using a primitive-based representation, learning geometry via mesh deformation, and leveraging rasterization for efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel neural scene representation called Deformable Neural Mesh Primitive (DNMP) for efficient rendering of large-scale scenes like urban environments. 

2. DNMP combines the efficiency of classic mesh representation with the powerful neural representation capability. Each DNMP models the geometry and radiance information of a local 3D region.

3. To represent an entire scene, it voxelizes the scene based on 3D reconstruction and assigns a DNMP to each voxel to parameterize its local geometry and appearance. 

4. To enable robust geometry optimization, the mesh vertex positions of each DNMP are decoded from a compact latent space learned by an autoencoder on various local 3D structures.

5. It proposes a hierarchical DNMP representation to handle incomplete reconstructions. The scene is voxelized at multiple resolutions and blended together during rendering.

6. For rendering, rasterization is used to interpolate vertex features and sample surface points. An MLP predicts radiance and opacity per sample which are blended to produce pixel colors.

7. Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis on urban datasets with faster speed and lower memory than NeRF variants. Scene editing is also enabled.

In summary, the key innovation is the DNMP representation that combines meshes and neural features for efficient large-scale scene modeling and rendering. The compact latent shape space and hierarchical representation also improve robustness.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in 3D scene representation and rendering:

- It proposes representing scenes with Deformable Neural Mesh Primitives (DNMPs), a new type of primitive combining meshes and neural features. This is a novel idea compared to prior work like NeRF which uses only continuous implicit functions. 

- The DNMP representation aims to achieve efficiency and scalability to large outdoor scenes. This goal is shared by some other recent works like Block-NeRF and Instant-NGP, but the DNMP approach provides an alternative strategy.

- For shape optimization, it leverages a learned latent space to constrain and regularize the deformation of primitives. This is different from prior deformable mesh papers like Pixel2Mesh which directly optimize vertex positions.

- It combines ideas from recent neural rendering (vertex features, hierarchical rendering) and neural meshes/primitives to achieve strong novel view synthesis results. The performance seems competitive or better than other specialized outdoor rendering methods.

- A key distinction is the focus on explicit surface modeling with DNMPs rather than purely implicit functions. This could provide advantages for efficiency, editing, and view extrapolation compared to NeRF-based approaches.

- Compared to point-based rendering methods like Neural Point Light Field, this introduces primitive connectivity and rasterization for more robust feature aggregation.

Overall, the paper integrates ideas from multiple areas to present a new primitive representation for neural rendering. The results demonstrate this is a promising direction compared to existing approaches, with advantages for efficiency, quality, and scalability in large outdoor scenes.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the method to dynamic scenes with moving objects. The current method assumes a static scene. The authors suggest extending it to handle dynamic scenes with moving objects like cars and pedestrians. This could allow the method to be applied more broadly.

- Exploring other primitive types beyond triangular meshes. The authors use deformable triangular mesh primitives in this work. They suggest exploring other types of primitives like cuboids, spheres, etc. Different primitives may be better suited for representing different scene structures.

- Improving view dependence modeling. The method currently uses a relatively simple view dependence modeling based on ray direction and surface normal. The authors suggest exploring more complex view dependence models to handle effects like reflections and refractions.

- Scaling up to larger scenes. The experiments are on relatively small scene sizes. Scaling up the method to represent larger outdoor environments like entire cities is an important direction. This will likely require techniques to handle the increased memory and computation requirements.

- Applications like VR/AR. The authors mention the explicit surface representation has potential for downstream applications like virtual and augmented reality. Exploring how to apply the method in these areas could be impactful future work.

- Combining with other scene representations. The method could be combined with other scene representations like voxel grids or octrees to harness their complementary strengths. Hybrid approaches could help push state-of-the-art further.

In summary, the key future directions relate to extending the method to dynamic scenes, exploring other primitives, improving view dependence, scaling up, applications to VR/AR, and combining the technique with complementary scene representations. The authors lay out these areas as promising avenues for developing the approach further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient radiance field representation for large-scale environments by combining efficient mesh-based rendering with powerful neural representations. Specifically, the method develops Deformable Neural Mesh Primitives (DNMPs) and represents the entire radiance field in a bottom-up manner with such primitives. Each DNMP models the geometry and radiance of a local voxelized region using a set of connected deformable mesh vertices paired with radiance features. The shape of each DNMP is constrained by decoding from a compact latent space learned on various local shapes. For rendering, rasterization is used to interpolate vertex features, which are input to an MLP to produce radiance and opacity. To handle incomplete reconstructions, a hierarchical representation with different DNMP scales is used. Experiments on urban datasets show the method achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis quality efficiently. The compact explicit representation also enables scene editing operations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Deformable Neural Mesh Primitives (DNMPs) for efficient and high-quality rendering of large-scale urban scenes. DNMPs combine the efficiency of classic mesh representations with the powerful radiance modeling capability of neural networks. Each DNMP consists of a set of connected deformable mesh vertices paired with radiance features. The vertex positions define the shape while the features encode radiance information. To constrain the degrees of freedom, DNMP shapes are decoded from a compact latent space learned by an autoencoder on a database of local 3D structures. 

For rendering, the target scene is voxelized based on a 3D reconstruction, and each voxel is assigned a DNMP to represent local geometry and appearance. DNMP shape latent codes are optimized based on estimated depth maps to fit the true geometry. To handle reconstruction noise, the scene is hierarchically voxelized at multiple resolutions with correspondingly sized DNMPs. For each ray, radiance features are interpolated from intersected DNMP faces via rasterization and fed to an MLP for volume rendering. Compared to NeRF methods, this approach achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with significantly improved efficiency by leveraging surface-aligned rasterization and avoiding sampling empty space. Scene editing is also naturally enabled by modifying DNMP features and shapes.
