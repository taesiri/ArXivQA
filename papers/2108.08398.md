# [A good body is all you need: avoiding catastrophic interference via   agent architecture search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08398)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether the physical architecture/design of a robot can help overcome catastrophic interference during policy learning across multiple environments. Specifically, the authors investigate whether the sensor distribution on a robot can induce policy parameter landscapes that are more conducive to discovering generalized policies that work across environments. The key hypothesis is that optimizing sensor placement and policy jointly will result in better sample efficiency compared to just optimizing the policy alone.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that optimizing a robot's physical structure along with its control policy can help overcome catastrophic interference during reinforcement learning across multiple environments. Specifically, the paper demonstrates that:

- The distribution of sensors on a robot's body impacts the overlap of optimal policies across environments, which correlates with resistance to catastrophic interference. This is quantified through two proposed metrics.

- These metrics correlate with actual sample efficiency during policy training with various optimization methods. 

- Simultaneously co-optimizing sensor placement and policy outperforms just optimizing the policy alone.

- Co-optimization discovers robot designs that exhibit sensor homeostasis across environments, which helps explain their ability to overcome catastrophic interference. 

Overall, the key insight is that a robot's physical design plays an important role in inducing loss landscapes that are more or less susceptible to catastrophic interference. By co-optimizing structure and policy, robots can be found that experience different environments similarly and thus learn efficiently across them.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper shows that optimizing a robot's physical design and control policy together results in robots that are more resistant to catastrophic interference during multi-task training compared to optimizing the control policy alone.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on catastrophic interference and robot design:

- The key novelty is looking at how the physical design/morphology of a robot can influence catastrophic interference, rather than just changes to the neural architecture or training process. Most prior work has focused on the latter. This paper makes a convincing case that physical design is an important and overlooked factor.

- The metrics proposed to quantify the degree of catastrophic interference based on the overlap of successful weight parameters is intuitive and seems valid. This provides a way to predict which designs will be prone to interference before training even begins.

- The experiments showing that the proposed metrics do indeed correlate with sample efficiency across various training algorithms help validate the usefulness of the metrics.

- Co-optimizing the policy and physical design demonstrates a promising way to find robot designs resistant to interference. The gains over just policy optimization alone are significant.

- The sensor homeostasis analysis provides initial mechanistic insight into why some robot designs help overcome interference. The environments are aliased to be more similar sensorially.

- The minimal simulated robot and task environments allow for exhaustive sweeps over design and policy spaces. This supports analytical tools like the metrics and homeostasis measurements. Testing on more complex robots and tasks remains future work.

Overall, the key strengths seem to be the novel focus on morphology, the proposed metrics, and the insights from being able to exhaustively analyze a minimal simulated system. The results convincingly demonstrate the influence of physical design on catastrophic interference. This could open up a useful new direction for overcoming this key challenge.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigating the degree to which design influences learnability in more complex robots, task environments and behaviors. The current work used a simple robot and task, so the authors suggest extending this approach to more complex settings.

- Using gradient-based methods for robot design optimization rather than just evolutionary methods. The authors suggest this could make agent design and policy optimization more compute and carbon efficient. 

- Including homeostasis in future loss functions to further improve sample efficiency in multi-domain policy and agent design training. The results showed designs evolved towards homeostasis without it being directly rewarded, so directly optimizing for it could be beneficial.

- Building physical instances of optimized simulated robot designs to test them in the real world. The current work is purely simulated, so fabricating the co-optimized designs and testing them on real robotic hardware is suggested.

- Exploring how other elements of physical robot design beyond just sensor placement impact catastrophic interference and multi-task learning, such as geometry, materials, and actuator placement.

- Developing methods to reduce the potential for surprising/unwanted behaviors when optimizing robot morphology and control, i.e. addressing the perverse instantiation issue that arises from increased morphospace.

So in summary, the main suggestions are to scale up the complexity, move from simulation to reality, expand the design parameters optimized, and develop techniques to improve the safety/reliability of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how a robot's physical design impacts its ability to learn control policies that work across multiple environments, a challenge known as catastrophic interference. The authors define metrics to measure how conducive a robot design is to overcoming interference, based on the overlap of specialized policies across environments. They show these metrics correlate with training sample efficiency across various algorithms. The authors then demonstrate simultaneous co-optimization of design and policy parameters leads to more efficient learning than policy optimization alone, and the optimized designs exhibit sensor homeostasis - experiencing different environments similarly. This provides evidence that physical robot design significantly impacts the learnability of policies resilient to interference across environments.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates how the physical design of a robot, specifically the placement of its sensors, can impact catastrophic interference during policy training across multiple environments. The authors define metrics to quantify the overlap between optimal policies for individual environments, arguing this predicts resistance to interference. They sweep sensor placements on a simulated robot and find designs that score highly on their metrics require fewer samples to train phototaxis policies across environments. The metrics correlate with sample efficiency for multiple algorithms. Co-optimizing sensor placement and policy parameters is significantly more efficient than policy search alone, converging on designs with sensor homeostasis.  

In summary, this paper provides evidence that robot morphology can exacerbate or suppress catastrophic interference by changing the overlap between specialized policies for different environments. The authors propose metrics to predict this and find support across training algorithms. Simultaneously optimizing design and policy is shown to efficiently discover interference resistant designs, which converge on sensor homeostasis. This suggests physical design should be considered alongside neural architecture and training methods when addressing catastrophic interference.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper explores how the physical design of a robot, specifically the placement of its sensors, can impact catastrophic interference during policy training across multiple environments. The authors define metrics to measure the distribution of specialized and generalist policies for a given robot design. They then evaluate a large set of possible robot designs using these metrics. The designs are tested on a phototaxis task across four environments using simulation. The authors find that the metric scores correlate with sample efficiency across several policy search methods, indicating they are good predictors of catastrophic interference. The paper shows that robot designs facilitating learning can be found via simultaneous co-optimization of the robot structure and policy. Co-optimization is found to be more sample efficient than policy optimization alone. The co-optimized designs exhibit sensor homeostasis, leading to the conclusion that properties like homeostasis may help robot bodies facilitate multi-environment policy search.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of catastrophic interference in reinforcement learning for robotics. Specifically, it is investigating how the physical design/structure of a robot can influence catastrophic interference when training policies across multiple environments.

The key questions the paper seems to be exploring are:

- How does a robot's physical design (e.g. sensor placement) affect the landscape of possible policies and susceptibility to catastrophic interference? 

- Can metrics be defined to quantify how conducive a robot design is to overcoming catastrophic interference?

- Do these metrics actually correlate with sample efficiency and performance when training policies on different robot designs?

- Can co-optimizing over robot structure and policy parameters lead to better performance than just optimizing the policy alone?

- What mechanism allows some robot designs to overcome catastrophic interference better than others?

So in summary, the main focus is on understanding and exploiting the relationship between robot morphology and catastrophic interference in reinforcement learning across multiple environments. The key idea is that an appropriate robot design can induce policy landscapes that alleviate catastrophic interference.
