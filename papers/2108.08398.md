# [A good body is all you need: avoiding catastrophic interference via   agent architecture search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08398)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether the physical architecture/design of a robot can help overcome catastrophic interference during policy learning across multiple environments. Specifically, the authors investigate whether the sensor distribution on a robot can induce policy parameter landscapes that are more conducive to discovering generalized policies that work across environments. The key hypothesis is that optimizing sensor placement and policy jointly will result in better sample efficiency compared to just optimizing the policy alone.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is showing that optimizing a robot's physical structure along with its control policy can help overcome catastrophic interference during reinforcement learning across multiple environments. Specifically, the paper demonstrates that:- The distribution of sensors on a robot's body impacts the overlap of optimal policies across environments, which correlates with resistance to catastrophic interference. This is quantified through two proposed metrics.- These metrics correlate with actual sample efficiency during policy training with various optimization methods. - Simultaneously co-optimizing sensor placement and policy outperforms just optimizing the policy alone.- Co-optimization discovers robot designs that exhibit sensor homeostasis across environments, which helps explain their ability to overcome catastrophic interference. Overall, the key insight is that a robot's physical design plays an important role in inducing loss landscapes that are more or less susceptible to catastrophic interference. By co-optimizing structure and policy, robots can be found that experience different environments similarly and thus learn efficiently across them.
