# [A good body is all you need: avoiding catastrophic interference via   agent architecture search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08398)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether the physical architecture/design of a robot can help overcome catastrophic interference during policy learning across multiple environments. Specifically, the authors investigate whether the sensor distribution on a robot can induce policy parameter landscapes that are more conducive to discovering generalized policies that work across environments. The key hypothesis is that optimizing sensor placement and policy jointly will result in better sample efficiency compared to just optimizing the policy alone.
