# [Long and Short-Term Constraints Driven Safe Reinforcement Learning for   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have shown promise for decision-making in autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, traditional RL methods suffer from safety issues during training due to uncontrolled exploration of unsafe states. Existing safe RL methods use constraints on expected cumulative cost to reduce long-term risk, but still allow short-term safety violations. This is unacceptable for AD systems, which require safety guarantees at every moment.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel safe RL method with Long and Short-Term Constraints (LSTC) to restrict exploration to safe regions and ensure safety at all times. 

The long-term constraint reduces cumulative risk over the entire driving episode, similar to prior safe RL methods. 

The key novelty is the short-term constraint, which uses a learned safety checker network to validate if an action leads to safe states over a future time horizon. This restricts moment-by-moment exploration space and prevents short-term safety violations.

To solve the constrained optimization problem with dual constraints, the method uses Lagrange relaxation and alternately updates the policy and Lagrange multipliers. The multipliers act as penalty coefficients when constraints are violated, guiding learning towards feasible policies.

Contributions:
- Proposes concept of long and short term constraints for safe RL, ensuring both cumulative and momentary safety for AD  
- Develops safe RL algorithm with dual constraint optimization using Lagrange relaxation to solve constrained policy optimization
- Achieves higher driving success rate and lower cost compared to prior safe RL methods in continuous control AD tasks
- Demonstrates safer exploration and faster convergence during training due to stringent short-term safety constraints

The key impact is an AD focused safe RL algorithm that provides strong safety guarantees by restricting the learned policy to only safe operating regions even during initial training exploration. This addresses a major limitation of applying RL to safety-critical AD systems.
