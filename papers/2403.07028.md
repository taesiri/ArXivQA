# [An Efficient Learning-based Solver Comparable to Metaheuristics for the   Capacitated Arc Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP), which aims to find the minimum-cost tour that traverses all required edges in a graph while satisfying capacity constraints. Solving CARP is challenging for neural network (NN) based methods compared to traditional metaheuristics due to the lack of (1) edge directionality modeling, and (2) effective learning schemes tailored for the complex CARP.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a learning-based solver that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art memetic algorithms for CARP while maintaining superior efficiency. The key ideas are:

1) A direction-aware attention model (DaAM) that computes embeddings for directed arcs instead of undirected edges. This enables concise one-stage decision making without separating edge sequence determination and direction decision. 

2) A supervised reinforcement learning scheme involving supervised pre-training to obtain a robust initial policy, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning using proximal policy optimization with self-critical training. This is designed particularly for the complex CARP.  

3) A path optimizer using dynamic programming to re-determine optimal return positions for vehicles in the generated path.

Main Contributions:
- First NN-based method to directly model directed arcs instead of undirected edges for CARP, enabling effective one-stage decision making.  
- A tailored supervised reinforcement learning pipeline for learning to effectively solve complex CARP problems.
- Achieves decision quality comparable to state-of-the-art metaheuristics for CARP for the first time among learning based methods, with superior efficiency.

 This paper proposes a neural network-based solver for the capacitated arc routing problem that achieves solution quality comparable to state-of-the-art metaheuristics while maintaining superior efficiency through directed arc modeling, supervised reinforcement learning, and path optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a neural network-based solver for the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art metaheuristics. The main contributions are:

1) A direction-aware attention model (DaAM) that encodes edge directionality directly into embeddings to enable one-stage decision making for arc selection. This avoids having to separately determine edge directions.

2) A supervised reinforcement learning scheme involving supervised pre-training to establish a robust initial policy, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning. This helps deal with the complexity of CARP more effectively than standard deep reinforcement learning.  

3) A path optimization method based on dynamic programming to adjust the depot return positions within the path generated by DaAM to further improve quality.

Through these contributions, the proposed solver surpasses heuristic methods and achieves near state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency compared to metaheuristics. This is the first neural network-based method to compete at this level for CARP.
