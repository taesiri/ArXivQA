# [An Efficient Learning-based Solver Comparable to Metaheuristics for the   Capacitated Arc Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP), which aims to find the minimum-cost tour that traverses all required edges in a graph while satisfying capacity constraints. Solving CARP is challenging for neural network (NN) based methods compared to traditional metaheuristics due to the lack of (1) edge directionality modeling, and (2) effective learning schemes tailored for the complex CARP.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a learning-based solver that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art memetic algorithms for CARP while maintaining superior efficiency. The key ideas are:

1) A direction-aware attention model (DaAM) that computes embeddings for directed arcs instead of undirected edges. This enables concise one-stage decision making without separating edge sequence determination and direction decision. 

2) A supervised reinforcement learning scheme involving supervised pre-training to obtain a robust initial policy, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning using proximal policy optimization with self-critical training. This is designed particularly for the complex CARP.  

3) A path optimizer using dynamic programming to re-determine optimal return positions for vehicles in the generated path.

Main Contributions:
- First NN-based method to directly model directed arcs instead of undirected edges for CARP, enabling effective one-stage decision making.  
- A tailored supervised reinforcement learning pipeline for learning to effectively solve complex CARP problems.
- Achieves decision quality comparable to state-of-the-art metaheuristics for CARP for the first time among learning based methods, with superior efficiency.
