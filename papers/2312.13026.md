# [FusDom: Combining In-Domain and Out-of-Domain Knowledge for Continuous   Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13026)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) models achieve state-of-the-art performance on speech tasks but suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on domains different from their pre-training domain. 
- Continued pre-training on target domains helps adapt models but often leads to forgetting knowledge acquired during initial SSL pre-training.
- Forgetting past knowledge leads to sub-optimal automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance on both current and previous domains.

Proposed Solution: 
- FusDom - A new continued pre-training methodology that learns representations robust and adaptive to target domains yet not forgetful of past knowledge.
- Employs two identical SSL models - a teacher and student. The teacher is frozen while only the student is updated during continued pre-training.
- A novel pre-training head with cross-attention between teacher and student representations. Teacher representations act as queries while student representations act as keys and values.  
- Effectively, student solves pre-text task aware of teacher's prior knowledge representations.
- After continued pre-training, student model fine-tuned for ASR using CTC or as feature extractor for encoder-decoder.

Main Contributions:
- FusDom facilitates continuous SSL on multiple distinct new domains without forgetting knowledge about past domains.
- Achieves optimal ASR performance on current and previous domains seen during pre-training. 
- Outperforms baselines by relative WER reductions of 6-16% on target domains while retaining performance on past domains.
- Provides a simple and effective solution to catastrophic forgetting in continued SSL pre-training paradigm.

In summary, FusDom leverages past acquired knowledge to facilitate continued SSL pre-training on non-IID data without forgetting previously seen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant ASR gains over baselines thereby proving efficacy of proposed approach.
