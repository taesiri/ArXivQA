# [Bias correction of wind power forecasts with SCADA data and continuous   learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Wind power plays a critical role in renewable energy transition, but its variability and uncertainty impedes growth. Wind power forecasting is important for power management, trading, maintenance etc.
- Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models provide wind forecasts but contain inherent biases and errors. Correcting these forecasts can mitigate wind power challenges. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors evaluate four machine learning models - gradient boosting regression (GB), neural network (NN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) - to correct the biases and improve 48-hour wind power forecasts from a NWP model.

- The models are trained on 2 years of wind power and NWP data from 65 turbines to output corrected power forecasts. A power curve based baseline model using raw NWP data represented biased forecasts.

Contributions:
- All models significantly reduced bias and improved forecasts over baseline, with CNN achieving best performance - lowering NRMSE down to 22% from 35% for baseline.

- Model architecture changes played minor role in performance; future work should focus on changes to model pipeline by incorporating additional features.

- A continuous learning strategy is introduced to periodically update models with new data. This outperformed training models only on new or old data, supporting model updating.

In summary, the paper demonstrates four machine learning approaches to successfully correct biases and enhance numerical weather model wind power forecasts. The best model reduced errors by over 35% from the biased baseline. A continuous learning strategy is also shown to improve model performance when new data becomes available.
