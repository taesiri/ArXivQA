# [Learning to Reason and Memorize with Self-Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00833)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we enable language models to perform explicit multi-step reasoning and state tracking by allowing them to take "self-notes" that interleave with the input context?

The key ideas and hypotheses behind this research question are:

- Vanilla language models struggle with multi-step reasoning and state tracking due to their fixed per-token computation and lack of explicit memory. 

- Allowing models to take "self-notes" - to deviate from the input context and write notes to themselves - can act as both explicit reasoning steps and memory for state tracking.

- Interleaving these self-notes with the context allows reasoning while reading, keeping inferences closer to relevant context. It also acts as a recurrent memory, overcoming transformers' limitations as feedforward networks.

- This approach can improve reasoning, state tracking, and generalization to longer sequences, in contrast to prior work like scratchpads that postpone reasoning until after reading the full context.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that allowing language models to take inline self-notes will improve their reasoning and memory capabilities compared to models without any explicit note-taking. The paper aims to test this hypothesis across several reasoning and state tracking tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "Self-Notes" that allows language models to take notes and do reasoning while reading a context, rather than only after reading the full context like in prior work. The Self-Notes method allows the model to deviate from the input context at any time to generate explicit reasoning tokens, which can act as both intermediate reasoning steps and memory for state tracking. This approach is shown through experiments to help the model generalize better to longer and more complicated test instances than seen during training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called "Self-Notes" that allows language models to take notes while reading text, enabling multi-step reasoning and overcoming limited context memory.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work:

- The idea of allowing models to take "self-notes" is similar to prior work on rationales, scratchpads, and chain-of-thought prompting. However, this paper proposes an "online" variant that allows note-taking interleaved with the context, rather than only at the end.

- The paper argues that taking notes inline allows reasoning steps to stay closer to the relevant context, and also acts as a memory since notes get fed back into the model. This differentiates the approach from post-context scratchpads/rationales.

- The paper focuses on studying the properties and abilities of the transformer architecture itself, rather than relying on very large models where chain-of-thought is an emergent capability.

- The experiments aim to test multi-step reasoning and state tracking abilities. Related work has studied length extrapolation, but often in a language modeling setting. The tasks here are more reasoning-focused.

- For training, the paper proposes supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods. Related work on rationales and scratchpads relies more on supervision.

- The unsupervised method trains the model to ask questions about its own samples. This is a novel approach compared to prior unsupervised rationale work.

Overall, the key novelty seems to be allowing the model to take notes interleaved with the context, rather than separated. The paper argues this allows better reasoning, memory, and length generalization. The experiments aim to demonstrate these benefits over baseline transformers and scratchpad approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Using reinforcement learning to discover optimal self-notes instead of relying on supervised labels. This would reduce the amount of supervision needed. 

- Testing whether very large models can learn to ask good self-note questions without any supervision, due to their emergent capabilities.

- Combining the self-notes method with a scratchpad, to get the benefits of both inline reasoning while reading the context as well as backward reasoning from the question.

- Training larger models with self-notes. The experiments in the paper were done with the 124M parameter GPT-2 model. The authors suggest training larger models as future work.

- Testing the approach on more tasks, including dialog tasks where online reasoning and memory are critical. The tasks explored in the paper were primarily synthetic reasoning tasks.

- Exploring different prompting techniques for eliciting good self-notes from the model.

In summary, the main future directions mentioned are around reducing supervision, testing the scales at which the method works, combining it with other techniques like scratchpads, and evaluating on more diverse tasks requiring online reasoning and memory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called "Self-Notes" that allows language models to take notes while reading text, in order to improve their ability to do multi-step reasoning and track state over long contexts. Unlike prior work like scratchpads that allow models to reason after reading the full context, Self-Notes lets models generate explicit reasoning tokens that interleave with the input context. This allows the model to recall information and perform reasoning on the fly as it processes the context. The model is trained to generate notes by providing ground truth notes in the training data. At test time, the model can deviate from the input context to take notes when needed. Experiments on reasoning and state tracking tasks show Self-Notes can generalize better to longer test instances than both vanilla language models and scratchpad models. The paper also explores semi-supervised and unsupervised training methods for Self-Notes. Overall, the interleaved nature of Self-Notes allows better multi-step reasoning and state tracking compared to postponing reasoning until after the full context.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called "Self-Notes" that allows language models to take notes while reading a context, in order to improve their ability to do multi-step reasoning and state tracking. The key idea is that the model can deviate from the input context at any time to write explicit reasoning steps or track state. This is different from prior methods like scratchpads or chain-of-thought prompting, where reasoning happens after the full context is processed. 

The Self-Notes method was tested on several synthetic and real-world datasets that require multi-step reasoning or state tracking, including a new proposed Toy Story task, algorithmic tasks, boolean logic tasks, and chess games. Across these datasets, Self-Notes outperformed baseline transformer models without explicit note-taking, as well as models with scratchpads. The paper also proposes semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for training Self-Notes. Overall, the results validate that allowing models to interleave reasoning tokens with the input context enables better multi-step reasoning and state tracking compared to doing reasoning after the full context is seen.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called "Self-Notes" that allows language models to take explicit notes while processing an input context, in order to improve multi-step reasoning and state tracking. During training, the model is provided with ground truth notes inserted within the context passages. At test time, the model can generate a special token to start writing a note, generate the note content, and then generate an end token to continue with the original context. This allows the model to write down intermediate reasoning steps and state changes on-the-fly as it processes the context. The notes act as both explicit reasoning chains and memory that gets fed back into the model. Experiments on multi-step reasoning tasks and program evaluation tasks demonstrate that Self-Notes improves performance compared to vanilla transformers and scratchpad methods, especially on longer test instances and for state tracking. The method is validated on a 124M parameter GPT-2 model.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problems and questions it is aiming to address are:

- Large language models like transformers struggle with multi-step reasoning and state tracking/memory, which limits their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks. 

- Prior work using rationales or scratchpads forces models to do reasoning after reading the full context. The paper argues reasoning should happen while reading the context.

- How can we allow language models to perform explicit reasoning and state tracking on the fly as they process input text, rather than just at the end?

- Can interleaving reasoning tokens within the input context improve multi-step reasoning and memory compared to doing reasoning separately after the full context?

- How can we train language models to learn to take useful "self-notes" - i.e. generate reasoning tokens interleaved in the context without full supervision?

- Does taking self-notes in this way improve generalization to longer contexts and more reasoning steps compared to models without self-notes?

So in summary, the key focus is on improving language models' capabilities for multi-step reasoning and memory by allowing them to interleave explicit reasoning tokens within the context they are processing. The paper aims to show this "self-notes" approach outperforms models that do reasoning separately after the full context.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called "Self-Notes" that allows language models to perform better reasoning and state tracking. The key idea is to allow the model to deviate from the input context at any time to explicitly write down its own thoughts and inferences in the form of notes. These Self-Notes act as both intermediate reasoning steps and a form of working memory, overcoming limitations of standard language models. The model can ask and answer sub-questions in the notes, make inferences, and track state changes. Unlike previous "scratchpad" methods that postpone reasoning until the end, Self-Notes interleave with the context. The authors demonstrate improved performance across many reasoning tasks, under supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and few-shot prompted settings. Overall, Self-Notes enhances language models' reasoning and memory capabilities by allowing them to think out loud as they process the context, similar to how humans read. The simple method has broad applicability to improving sequential reasoning in language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the \selfnotes{} method proposed in this paper:

1. The \selfnotes{} method allows models to generate reasoning notes that interleave the input context. How does this differ from previous "scratchpad" or "chain-of-thought" methods that generate reasoning after the full context is seen? What are the potential advantages of interleaving reasoning with the context?

2. The paper proposes four different paradigms for learning to generate useful \selfnotes{}: supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and few-shot prompted. Can you explain the differences between these four learning setups and when each one might be most suitable? 

3. \selfnotes{} are proposed as a way to enhance both multi-step reasoning and state tracking memory in language models. Can you explain how generating intermediate reasoning notes can help with multi-step reasoning? And how does explicitly writing variable states help with state tracking?

4. The ablation studies aim to tease apart whether the gains from \selfnotes{} are due to the additional compute from extra tokens, or the actual content of the notes. What do the "dummy token" experiments reveal about this? Why is intelligently placing dummy tokens better than naively adding them?

5. How does the idea of \selfnotes{} relate to how humans read and reason? What parallels can be drawn between a model taking notes while reading, and how students take notes in class or while studying?

6. Could the idea of \selfnotes{} be applied in other modalities like vision QA where a model might need to explicitly write down intermediate reasoning steps? What changes would need to be made to adapt \selfnotes{} to vision tasks?

7. The unsupervised and few-shot prompted \selfnotes{} methods do not require reasoning labels during training. Can you explain how the model is able to learn what questions to ask itself and useful notes to take in these setups?

8. The paper highlights being able to reason while reading as an important capability for intelligence. Do you think \selfnotes{} get us closer to that goal? What other capabilities would an intelligent agent need?

9. The results show that \selfnotes{} outperform baselines across a diverse set of reasoning tasks. Are there any tasks or settings where you think \selfnotes{} may struggle? When might it be better to just have post-context reasoning?

10. The idea of Self-Notes is intuitive yet powerful. What other simple but impactful modifications could be made to transformer models to unlock new capabilities? Are there any other "low-hanging fruits" left?
