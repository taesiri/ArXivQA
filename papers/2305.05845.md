# [Sketching the Future (STF): Applying Conditional Control Techniques to   Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05845)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: Can a novel approach that combines zero-shot text-to-video generation with conditional control techniques improve the output quality and controllability of text-to-video models?The key points are:- Text-to-video generation is challenging due to lack of training data and difficulty controlling output with just text prompts. - The authors propose a new method called "Sketching the Future" (STF) that takes sketched frames as additional input to better guide video generation.- STF combines zero-shot text-to-video (Text2Video Zero) with conditional control (ControlNet).- The hypothesis is that by adding sketched frames as conditional input, STF can improve the quality and control over text-to-video generation compared to Text2Video Zero alone.- Experiments aim to demonstrate STF's ability to produce videos that more accurately match the desired motion specified through the sketched frames, which Text2Video Zero struggles with using just text prompts.In summary, the central research question is whether the proposed STF approach can enhance text-to-video generation by incorporating sketched frames as conditional control input. The hypothesis is that STF will improve output quality and controllability compared to baseline Text2Video Zero.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called STF (Sketching the Future) that combines zero-shot text-to-video generation with conditional control techniques to improve the output of text-to-video models. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing an approach to take multiple sketched frames as input along with a text prompt, and generate a video output that matches the flow and motion conveyed across the sketched frames.- Building upon the Text-to-Video Zero architecture and incorporating ControlNet to enable conditional control based on the input sketched frames. - Interpolating additional frames between the input sketches and using them along with the text prompt in Text-to-Video Zero conditioned on the sketched frames via ControlNet.- Demonstrating through experiments that this approach can generate more accurate and high-quality video content compared to just using Text-to-Video Zero with text prompts.- Providing a comprehensive set of resources including a demo video, project website, GitHub repo, and Colab for users to explore the method.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating an effective way to combine zero-shot text-to-video generation with sketch-based conditional control to achieve better video generation results. The method provides more control over the output to match user's intended vision.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces an innovative approach to text-to-video generation by combining zero-shot generation with conditional control techniques. Here is an analysis of how it compares to other related work:- Compared to traditional text-to-video methods that require large datasets, this approach is more flexible and efficient by leveraging existing text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion in a zero-shot manner. Other zero-shot video generation papers like Text2Video-Zero and Make-A-Video also take a similar approach, but this paper uniquely incorporates control techniques on top.- The use of ControlNet as a conditional control method is novel in the context of text-to-video generation. Other papers have explored conditioning video generation on various inputs, but ControlNet provides an end-to-end trainable way to achieve robust control even with small datasets.- The idea of using multiple sketched frames as control inputs is innovative. Other conditional video generation papers like Video Diffusion Models use segmentation maps or keypoints, but sketch-based control has not been extensively explored before. The interpolation between sketches is also a simple but effective technique.- For evaluation, this paper relies on qualitative examples rather than quantitative metrics. Some other text-to-video papers do report metrics like FID, but qualitative assessment is also valuable for a creative task like conditional video generation. More rigorous quantitative evaluation could be considered in future work. - The application domains considered, like conditional video generation and video editing, align with other recent text-to-video papers. But the sketch-based control proposed in this paper could open up new creative applications that leverage drawing/sketching interfaces.Overall, this paper pushes text-to-video generation capabilities further by judiciously combining existing techniques like zero-shot generation and ControlNet with a novel sketch-based control approach. The qualitative results demonstrate the promise of this method for controllable video creation. More extensive evaluation on diverse control inputs and video datasets could build upon this solid foundation in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring the integration of additional input modalities beyond sketched frames, such as audio or text, to provide even more control over the generated video content.- Investigating methods for automatically generating the sketched frames from textual descriptions or other inputs, which could streamline the overall video generation process.- Improving the quality of the generated videos by refining the interpolation process between sketched frames and optimizing the control mechanism.- Evaluating the performance of the proposed STF approach on a wider range of tasks and scenarios, including more complex and dynamic scenes, to further demonstrate its versatility.- Extending the approach to other related tasks such as conditional and content-specialized video generation, video editing guided by instructions, etc.- Developing techniques to make the approach more scalable, such as exploring ways to train it on large datasets efficiently.- Exploring the societal impacts of the technology and developing ethical guidelines for its responsible use, to mitigate risks like disinformation. - Combining the approach with other modalities like audio, dialogue, captions etc. to extend its capabilities.- Evaluating the approach quantitatively using metrics like Fr√©chet Video Distance to benchmark performance.- Exploring ways to further improve video consistency, flow, and realism using techniques like optical flow, interpolation, and GANs.In summary, the main suggested directions are around enhancing the flexibility, scalability, and controllability of the approach, improving the video quality, evaluating it extensively on diverse tasks, studying societal impacts, and combining it with other modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel method called Sketching the Future (STF) that improves text-to-video generation by combining zero-shot techniques with conditional control. The approach builds on prior work in text-to-image diffusion models and the Text2Video-Zero architecture. STF takes multiple sketched frames as input and generates video output that matches the flow of the sketches. It first interpolates frames between the input sketches and then runs Text2Video-Zero using the interpolated frames as control input. This allows STF to leverage the benefits of both zero-shot text-to-video generation and the robust control of conditional techniques like ControlNet. Experiments demonstrate STF's ability to produce high-quality, consistent videos that accurately reflect the intended motion, overcoming limitations of text-to-video methods that struggle with motion specifics. The proposed technique has significant potential to impact creative industries, accessibility, and education by enabling flexible video generation with minimal data and resources.
