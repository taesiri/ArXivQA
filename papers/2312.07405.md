# [ICL Markup: Structuring In-Context Learning using Soft-Token Tags](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07405)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method to structure in-context learning (ICL) prompts using a set of soft-token tags, inspired by markup languages like HTML. The goal is to reduce the number of arbitrary prompt engineering decisions and improve robustness. The authors introduce tags like <classification>, <options>, <demo>, <input>, and <label> to standardize parts of an ICL prompt. These tags are added to the model vocabulary as trainable parameters. They are learned in a parameter-efficient "warm-up" fine-tuning phase on related tasks, then can be used in templates for new unseen tasks without additional tuning. Experiments on intent detection, news classification, and legal text datasets show that this ICL Markup approach can reduce performance variability compared to prompt engineering. It also tends to increase few-shot classification accuracy. On a Huffington Post benchmark, ICL Markup helps the Flan-T5-XL model achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. The method also shows promising results on challenging open-world intent detection. Overall, the proposed markup language paradigm offers a way to get more consistent and effective performance from in-context learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes structuring in-context learning prompt templates using dedicated soft-token tags learned in a parameter-efficient "warm-up" phase, which improves model performance and reduces variability compared to hand-written prompt engineering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to structure in-context learning (ICL) prompt templates using dedicated soft-token tags, inspired by markup languages like HTML. Specifically:

- They introduce a set of soft-token tags (\ttag{classification}, \ttag{options}, etc.) that are added to the language model's vocabulary. These tags are learned during a parameter-efficient "warm-up" fine-tuning process on related tasks.

- The tags can then be used in prompt templates for new unseen tasks, removing many arbitrary prompt engineering decisions. The tags provide a standardized syntax to compose prompts.

- Experiments show this "ICL Markup" approach can improve performance on unseen tasks like few-shot intent detection and text classification, compared to typical prompt engineering. It also makes ICL performance more robust.

So in summary, the main contribution is using a set of learned soft-token tags to structure ICL prompts, which is shown empirically to improve robustness and effectiveness over prompt engineering alone.

The paper proposes using a markup language inspired set of soft-token tags to structure in-context learning prompt templates. This reduces arbitrary choices in prompt design and makes ICL easier to apply. The tags are learned during a parameter-efficient "warm-up" fine-tuning stage. Experiments show this approach, referred to as ICL Markup, improves performance and robustness over regular prompt engineering for tasks like few-shot intent detection and text classification. The method is a form of meta-learning for in-context learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How exactly does the proposed ICL Markup approach reduce the number of arbitrary choices involved in constructing an ICL prompt template? Does it completely eliminate arbitrary choices or only reduce them? 

2. The paper states that ICL Markup is a form of meta-learning for ICL. Can you explain in more detail the relationship between ICL Markup and meta-learning? How is the "warm-up" fine-tuning process a way of meta-learning?

3. The choice of how to initialize the soft tokens (random vs "annealing") seems to have a significant impact on model performance, especially when a "none of the above" option is included. Can you speculate on why this is the case? What are the tradeoffs?

4. The paper evaluates performance on shifts in label space, input styles, and task objectives between training and evaluation. Which type of shift do you think is most challenging for the approach? Why?

5. The use of an MMR retriever for demonstration selection is an interesting aspect of the pipeline proposed. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to a simpler nearest neighbor retrieval?

6. How well do you expect the proposed approach to scale up to much larger language models and much more complex tasks? What challenges do you foresee?

7. The method does not update any model parameters at test time. Do you think a hybrid approach that allows some parameter updating could be beneficial? What are the potential tradeoffs there?  

8. The paper compares performance to prompt tuning methods that do update parameters at test time. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of avoiding test time tuning?

9. What other structured markup languages, besides HTML, could inspire similar ideas for standardizing and simplifying prompt engineering?

10. The method aims to improve robustness of ICL, but evaluating robustness itself seems challenging. What metrics or experiments could better evaluate the robustness of ICL methods?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) is very flexible and powerful, but lacks robustness due to sensitivity to arbitrary choices in prompt design. This makes it difficult to apply consistently.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a markup language-inspired set of soft token tags (e.g. <input>, <label>) to structure ICL prompts and templates. These reduce arbitrary choices.
- Learn weights for tags in a parameter-efficient "warm-up" fine-tuning phase on related tasks. The learned tags can then be used for ICL on new unseen tasks without further tuning.

Key Contributions:
- Propose using dedicated soft tokens as ICL tags to create reusable templates, reducing arbitrary decisions. This is a form of meta-learning for ICL.
- Show tags can be learned efficiently from related tasks then transferred to new unseen tasks via ICL, improving accuracy and reducing variability.
- On few-shot text classification tasks, ICL tags yield state-of-the-art accuracy on a news dataset and improve intent detection.
- For open-world intent detection, tags improve accuracy and out-of-scope detection over strong baselines.
- Demonstrate potential for ICL tags learned on one family of tasks (e.g. intent detection) to provide some value on unrelated tasks (e.g. legal text classification).

In summary, the paper introduces structured ICL markup tags as a promising approach to improve prompt engineering. Experiments show accuracy gains, reduced variability, and potential for transfer learning.
