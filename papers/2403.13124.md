# [Cooperative Modular Manipulation with Numerous Cable-Driven Robots for   Assistive Construction and Gap Crossing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13124)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current military gap crossing operations for building temporary bridges require dangerous, time-consuming manual labor and heavy specialized equipment. This introduces logistical challenges and limits flexibility. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a cooperative, modular cable-driven robot system called Co3MaNDR to address these limitations. 

- Co3MaNDR consists of multiple separate robot modules that connect cables to a central payload and coordinate to control the tensions in the cables. By controlling the cable tensions, they can manipulate the position and orientation of the payload.

- The cable tensions are controlled using an optimization-based controller that enables scaling to arbitrary numbers of modules and payloads. 

- The robot modules use proprietary actuators designed for high bandwidth force control to approximate ideal force sources.

Key Contributions:

- Introduces an innovative application of cable-driven robot technology using concepts from force-controlled legged robots to achieve a cooperative, modular system for large payload manipulation. 

- Validates a cable tension controller based on quadratic programming optimization that coordinates and scales to arbitrary numbers of robot modules.

- Demonstrates a 4 robot module system manipulating a 60 lb payload, reducing the forces needing to be applied manually by over 85% on average.

- Shows experimental evidence that adding more modules reduces the torque requirements per module, confirming scalability.

- Establishes feasibility of using high bandwidth force control with cable robots to enable human guidance of heavy payloads and force amplification.

- Overall enables safer, faster temporary bridge construction without reliance on heavy machinery. Lays groundwork to expand cable robot capabilities to unstable, unstructured environments.
