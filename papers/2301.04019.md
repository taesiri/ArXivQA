# [FGAHOI: Fine-Grained Anchors for Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04019)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel transformer-based model called FGAHOI for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. HOI detection aims to locate human and object instances in images along with recognizing the interactions between them, which is more challenging than regular object detection due to greater spatial spans, scale variety, and complex relational reasoning required. Most methods are susceptible to distractions from noisy image backgrounds during HOI detection. To address this, FGAHOI leverages input image features to generate fine-grained anchors guiding the decoder to focus on pivotal areas and aiding critical semantic information extraction, protecting detection from background noise. The key components proposed include a multi-scale sampling mechanism extracting hierarchical spatial features from humans, objects, and their interaction regions; a hierarchical spatial-aware merging module aligning the features and query embeddings spatially; a task-aware merging module aligning them based on interaction tasks. A new stage-wise training strategy is also introduced clarifying direction during training to maximize cost savings. Further, two metrics quantifying uneven human-object area distributions and long visual modeling distances are proposed alongside a novel HOI-SDC dataset targeting those challenges for model evaluation. Extensive comparative experiments on HICO-DET, HOI-SDC, and V-COCO datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by FGAHOI, validating the effectiveness of its components through ablation studies.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

1. It proposes a novel transformer-based human-object interaction detector (FGAHOI) which leverages input features to generate fine-grained anchors. These anchors help protect the detection from noisy backgrounds.

2. It proposes a new training strategy where each component of the model is trained sequentially. This clarifies the training direction at each stage to maximize training cost savings. 

3. It proposes two new metrics and a new dataset (HOI-SDC) for evaluating two key challenges in HOI detection: uneven size distribution of human/object pairs and long distance between pairs. 

4. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (HICO-DET, HOI-SDC, V-COCO) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FGAHOI model, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

In summary, the main contributions are: a new HOI detection model (FGAHOI), a staged training strategy, new evaluation metrics/dataset for HOI challenges, and superior performance over prior arts.
