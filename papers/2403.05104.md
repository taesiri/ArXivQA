# [How Culture Shapes What People Want From AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current AI systems and human-AI interaction models lack rigorous consideration of cultural differences in what people want from AI. Most AI research and development happens in Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultural contexts. As a result, current visions of ideal AI likely reflect cultural assumptions rooted in independent models of the self predominant in Western cultures. There is an urgent need to expand AI visions using cultural models from more diverse cultural groups.  

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose that people draw on pre-existing cultural models of the relationship between the self and environment when imagining ideal AI. People from interdependent cultures see the environment as an active influence, leading them to prefer AI systems with greater autonomy and influence capacities. People from independent cultures see the self as controlling environments, leading them to prefer AI systems over which they have control.

The authors test cultural differences in desired human-AI interactions between European Americans (independent model), Chinese (interdependent model) and African Americans (both models) using two survey studies.

Key Findings:
1) Chinese respondents preferred the environment to influence people more, whereas European Americans preferred people to influence the environment more. African Americans fell in between.  

2) Compared to European Americans, Chinese regarded controlling AI as less important but connecting with AI as more important. They also preferred AI to have greater capacities to influence (autonomy, spontaneity, emotions).  

3) African Americans resembled European Americans in valuing control over AI but resembled Chinese in valuing connecting with AI. Their preferences for AI influence capacities fell between the other groups.

Contributions:
1) Provides cultural psychological frameworks and empirical tools to study how culture shapes AI preferences 

2) Challenges control-focused assumptions predominant in current human-AI interaction models

3) Expands conceptions of ideal AI characteristics by highlighting preferences for greater AI autonomy and influence capacities   

4) Calls for developing culturally-responsive AI systems that serve diverse populations

In sum, the paper makes important theoretical and empirical contributions towards understanding and accommodating cultural diversity in AI research and development.
