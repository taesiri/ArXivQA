# [Testing Hateful Speeches against Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12418)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How do deep neural network-based AI systems perform with respect to conforming to natural language policy requirements, specifically in the context of online content moderation?

The authors focus on evaluating AI-based content moderation systems against Facebook's community standards guidelines for hate speech detection. They aim to examine whether these AI systems are consistently able to detect hate speech as specified in the different policies outlined in Facebook's guidelines. 

The key steps and research questions addressed are:

RQ1: How to examine deep neural network-based systems against natural language policies? 

The authors use crowdsourcing to manually build a dataset (HateModerate) of hate speech examples that match each policy in Facebook's guidelines.

RQ2: How do deep neural network-based systems perform against natural language policies?

The authors test state-of-the-art content moderation APIs on the HateModerate dataset and analyze their failure rates across different policies. 

RQ3: What is the promise for automatically matching test cases to policy requirements?

The authors fine-tune language models to automatically match hate speech examples to policies and examine the classification accuracy.

So in summary, the central focus is evaluating conformity of AI moderation systems to natural language policy requirements, using hate speech moderation as a case study. The key contribution is the analysis methodology and findings around AI systems' ability to correctly implement real-world policies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a framework to examine the behavior of deep learning-based content moderation systems against natural language policy requirements. 

2. Using crowdsourcing to build a dataset (HateModerate) of hate speech examples matching each of the 41 content moderation policies from Facebook.

3. Evaluating state-of-the-art content moderation APIs from major tech companies on the dataset and finding high failure rates for certain policies. 

4. Exploring the promise of automatically matching new examples to policies by finetuning large language models, achieving 78.4% accuracy.

In summary, this paper focuses on testing AI-based content moderation systems against policies, proposes both manual and automated approaches to build test suites matching policies, and reveals the deficiencies of existing systems on certain policies through evaluation. The framework could potentially be extended to test AI systems in other domains against natural language requirements as well.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to examine the behavior of AI-based content moderation systems against natural language moderation policies, by first collecting labeled test cases matching the policies through crowdsourcing, then evaluating state-of-the-art moderation APIs on these test cases to identify failure cases, and finally exploring automated matching of examples to policies using large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is an analysis comparing this paper to other related works on testing AI systems against requirements:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing a framework to test AI systems against natural language requirements, focusing on the application of content moderation. The paper has three main steps:

1) Manually building a test dataset (HateModerate) to cover different natural language requirements (Facebook's content moderation policies).

2) Testing state-of-the-art AI moderation models on the test dataset and analyzing their failure rates across different policies. 

3) Exploring automated methods to map new examples to requirements.

This work is novel in directly examining AI system behaviors against textual requirements. Prior work like CheckList [1] and TestAug [2] developed test collections for NLP systems based on requirement templates rather than real-world policies. Works like RESAM [3] elicited requirements for anomaly detection models rather than moderation. 

The crowdsourcing approach to build the test dataset based on real-world requirements is also novel. Prior hate speech datasets either lacked requirement-level labels [4,5] or used simplistic assumptions about requirements [6]. Analyzing model behaviors on such precisely-labeled data is an important contribution.

The automated mapping in Step 3 is less mature compared to the other contributions, but still provides useful benchmarks on the feasibility of automating this process.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress towards the under-explored problem of testing AI systems against textual requirements, especially for the important application area of content moderation. The combination of crowdsourced data collection, model testing, and automation is a promising framework that can enable more rigorous and thorough testing of AI behaviors in the future.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the coverage of test cases in each policy. The authors note that HateModerate may lack sufficient coverage of some datasets and policies. They suggest adding more examples from other hate speech datasets to improve coverage. They also propose defining metrics to measure test case coverage for requirements.

- Discovering more policy requirements that are not already covered in Facebook's existing policies. The authors suggest identifying new requirements by analyzing forum discussions. 

- Improving the accuracy of automatically matching examples to policies in Step 3. The classification accuracy is currently around 78%, so there is room for improvement. Ideas include adding more examples that are often confused, increasing the length of the policy description in the output, and exploring human-AI collaboration.

- Studying the impacts of context on hate speech perception. The authors note they have not considered context, which can impact whether something is viewed as hateful. They suggest studying human perception of hate speech in context.

- Extending the framework to other categories of content moderation besides hate speech, such as nudity, misinformation, etc. The authors believe their overall workflow could be applied to test models against policies for other content moderation categories.

In summary, the main future directions are improving coverage of test cases, discovering new requirements, boosting automated policy matching accuracy, incorporating context and human studies, and extending the framework to other content moderation categories. The authors lay out several promising ways to build on their work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper examines how deep neural network-based systems perform against natural language policy requirements, focusing on the application of online content moderation. The authors first construct a dataset called HateModerate, which contains hate speech examples matching each of 41 content moderation policies from Facebook's community standards. This is done via crowdsourcing, by having annotators search existing hate speech datasets for examples matching each policy, followed by validation. They then use HateModerate to test three content moderation APIs - Facebook's RoBERTa model, Google's Perspective API, and OpenAI's Moderation API. They find high failure rates for certain policies by all three models, indicating they do not satisfy the requirements. Finally, they show the promise of using large language models to automatically match hate speech examples to policies, achieving 78.4% accuracy. The work demonstrates the challenges in ensuring AI systems meet natural language policy requirements, and proposes crowdsourcing combined with language models as one potential solution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper examines how deep neural network-based systems behave in relation to natural language policy requirements, focusing on a case study of content moderation policies for hate speech. The authors first build a dataset called HateModerate by using crowdsourcing to extract hate speech examples from existing datasets that match each of Facebook's 41 content moderation policies. They then use this dataset to test three hate speech detection APIs - Facebook's RoBERTa model, Google's Perspective API, and OpenAI's Moderation API. They find high failure rates, especially for OpenAI's API, showing these models do not satisfy certain policies. Finally, they train classifiers to automatically match hate speech examples to policies, achieving 78.4% accuracy. This shows promise for automated matching to reduce manual labeling costs. 

In summary, this paper makes three main contributions: (1) constructing a novel dataset, HateModerate, to enable testing models against natural language policies; (2) evaluating major content moderation APIs and identifying high failure rates, showing inconsistency with policies; (3) showing initial promise in automating the mapping of examples to policies through finetuning language models. The authors highlight directions for future work including improving coverage of test cases, discovering new requirements, and increasing accuracy of automated mapping. Overall, this paper provides a useful case study and framework for testing alignment between AI system behaviors and policy requirements.
