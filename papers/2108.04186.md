# [Pose is all you need: The pose only group activity recognition system   (POGARS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04186)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:- Can group activity recognition be performed accurately using only tracked human poses as input, without relying on raw RGB video frames? - Will a model trained on pose data generalize better to new test data compared to models trained on RGB video frames?- Can 1D CNNs more effectively model the temporal dynamics of human poses for group activity recognition compared to RNN/LSTM models used in prior work?- Do spatial and temporal attention mechanisms help improve group activity recognition accuracy by identifying key people and video frames?- Does multi-task learning to jointly predict group and individual actions boost performance on the primary task of group activity recognition?The central hypothesis seems to be that a model using only tracked human poses as input can match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods that use RGB frames and/or optical flow as input for group activity recognition. The authors design the POGARS model architecture to test this hypothesis. The other questions explore the benefits of different architectural choices like 1D CNNs versus RNNs and the usefulness of attention. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses and design decisions empirically.In summary, the key focus is on developing an accurate and robust pose-based model for group activity recognition that generalizes better than methods relying on raw pixel input. The paper explores architectural innovations to achieve this goal.
