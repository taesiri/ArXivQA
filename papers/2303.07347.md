# [TriDet: Temporal Action Detection with Relative Boundary Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07347)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key points are:- The paper aims to develop an improved one-stage framework for temporal action detection called TriDet. The main research goals are to:1) Improve action boundary localization by modeling the relative response intensity around the boundary rather than directly regressing the offsets. This is done through a proposed Trident-head module.2) Design an efficient feature pyramid module that can capture multi-scale temporal information without the issues of self-attention like rank loss and high complexity. This is done through a proposed Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer. - The central hypothesis seems to be that modeling action boundaries based on relative probabilities between adjacent snippets and using a convolutional feature pyramid can lead to improved efficiency and accuracy compared to prior approaches for temporal action detection.- Specifically, the Trident-head aims to address the problem of imprecise boundary localization in other methods by considering the relative probabilities of being a boundary for neighboring snippets. - The SGP layer in the feature pyramid aims to capture multi-scale information efficiently without the rank loss and complexity issues of self-attention.So in summary, the key research goals are developing the Trident-head and SGP layer to improve localization and efficiency for one-stage temporal action detection. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance which supports the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes TriDet, a one-stage temporal action detection framework with two novel components:- Trident-head: A new detection head to precisely localize action boundaries based on relative boundary modeling. It estimates the boundary offset using a predicted relative probability distribution around the boundary. - Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer: An efficient convolutional-based module to replace the commonly used transformer layer in the feature pyramid. It resolves the rank loss issue of self-attention and captures temporal information at different granularities.2. Extensive experiments show TriDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, HACS Segment and EPIC-KITCHENS datasets with high efficiency. For example, on THUMOS14 it improves the average mAP from 66.8% to 69.3% compared to previous best method ActionFormer, using only 74.6% of its latency.3. In-depth analysis on the design choices to provide insights for future research. For instance, the comparative studies demonstrate the essence of transformer-based feature pyramid lies in its macro-architecture rather than self-attention.In summary, the key contribution is a simple and efficient one-stage detector TriDet, which obtains new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks through two specially designed components for temporal action detection. The extensive experiments and analysis also provide valuable insights.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a one-stage temporal action detection framework called TriDet that uses a novel Trident-head to model action boundaries and an efficient Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer in the feature pyramid to aggregate information across temporal granularities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, HACS and EPIC-KITCHEN benchmarks while being computationally efficient.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research on temporal action detection:- This paper proposes a one-stage framework called TriDet for temporal action detection in videos. Most prior work uses two-stage approaches with separate proposal generation and classification steps. Recent one-stage methods have started to show promising results, and this paper follows that trend.- A key contribution is the novel Trident-head, which models the action boundary as a relative probability distribution to improve localization accuracy. Other methods typically predict boundaries based on regression from a single point, global segment features, or sampling from the segment. Modeling the relative boundary distribution is a new approach aimed at handling ambiguous action boundaries.- The paper also proposes a Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) module for the feature pyramid to aggregate multi-scale temporal information efficiently. This replaces the transformer-based feature pyramid used in recent papers with a convolutional design to avoid issues like rank loss and high complexity.- For modeling contributions, the Trident-head and SGP layer seem unique compared to prior art. The overall one-stage architecture builds on recent trends but with these new components.- Experiments across THUMOS14, HACS, and EPIC-KITCHENS show state-of-the-art results, outperforming recent transformer-based methods like ActionFormer and achieving a good efficiency vs accuracy trade-off.- The improvements over prior state-of-the-art like ActionFormer are modest (1-3% mAP) but the simplified design and efficiency analysis suggest promising future work on efficient convolutional temporal modeling.In summary, the main comparisons are the novel Trident-head and SGP modules for localization and feature modeling, the overall one-stage design, and strong empirical results demonstrating efficiency, accuracy, and state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. The paper makes incremental but meaningful contributions to advancing one-stage temporal action detection.
