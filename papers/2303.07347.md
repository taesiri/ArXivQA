# [TriDet: Temporal Action Detection with Relative Boundary Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07347)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key points are:

- The paper aims to develop an improved one-stage framework for temporal action detection called TriDet. The main research goals are to:

1) Improve action boundary localization by modeling the relative response intensity around the boundary rather than directly regressing the offsets. This is done through a proposed Trident-head module.

2) Design an efficient feature pyramid module that can capture multi-scale temporal information without the issues of self-attention like rank loss and high complexity. This is done through a proposed Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer. 

- The central hypothesis seems to be that modeling action boundaries based on relative probabilities between adjacent snippets and using a convolutional feature pyramid can lead to improved efficiency and accuracy compared to prior approaches for temporal action detection.

- Specifically, the Trident-head aims to address the problem of imprecise boundary localization in other methods by considering the relative probabilities of being a boundary for neighboring snippets. 

- The SGP layer in the feature pyramid aims to capture multi-scale information efficiently without the rank loss and complexity issues of self-attention.

So in summary, the key research goals are developing the Trident-head and SGP layer to improve localization and efficiency for one-stage temporal action detection. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance which supports the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes TriDet, a one-stage temporal action detection framework with two novel components:

- Trident-head: A new detection head to precisely localize action boundaries based on relative boundary modeling. It estimates the boundary offset using a predicted relative probability distribution around the boundary. 

- Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer: An efficient convolutional-based module to replace the commonly used transformer layer in the feature pyramid. It resolves the rank loss issue of self-attention and captures temporal information at different granularities.

2. Extensive experiments show TriDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, HACS Segment and EPIC-KITCHENS datasets with high efficiency. For example, on THUMOS14 it improves the average mAP from 66.8% to 69.3% compared to previous best method ActionFormer, using only 74.6% of its latency.

3. In-depth analysis on the design choices to provide insights for future research. For instance, the comparative studies demonstrate the essence of transformer-based feature pyramid lies in its macro-architecture rather than self-attention.

In summary, the key contribution is a simple and efficient one-stage detector TriDet, which obtains new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks through two specially designed components for temporal action detection. The extensive experiments and analysis also provide valuable insights.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a one-stage temporal action detection framework called TriDet that uses a novel Trident-head to model action boundaries and an efficient Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer in the feature pyramid to aggregate information across temporal granularities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, HACS and EPIC-KITCHEN benchmarks while being computationally efficient.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research on temporal action detection:

- This paper proposes a one-stage framework called TriDet for temporal action detection in videos. Most prior work uses two-stage approaches with separate proposal generation and classification steps. Recent one-stage methods have started to show promising results, and this paper follows that trend.

- A key contribution is the novel Trident-head, which models the action boundary as a relative probability distribution to improve localization accuracy. Other methods typically predict boundaries based on regression from a single point, global segment features, or sampling from the segment. Modeling the relative boundary distribution is a new approach aimed at handling ambiguous action boundaries.

- The paper also proposes a Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) module for the feature pyramid to aggregate multi-scale temporal information efficiently. This replaces the transformer-based feature pyramid used in recent papers with a convolutional design to avoid issues like rank loss and high complexity.

- For modeling contributions, the Trident-head and SGP layer seem unique compared to prior art. The overall one-stage architecture builds on recent trends but with these new components.

- Experiments across THUMOS14, HACS, and EPIC-KITCHENS show state-of-the-art results, outperforming recent transformer-based methods like ActionFormer and achieving a good efficiency vs accuracy trade-off.

- The improvements over prior state-of-the-art like ActionFormer are modest (1-3% mAP) but the simplified design and efficiency analysis suggest promising future work on efficient convolutional temporal modeling.

In summary, the main comparisons are the novel Trident-head and SGP modules for localization and feature modeling, the overall one-stage design, and strong empirical results demonstrating efficiency, accuracy, and state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. The paper makes incremental but meaningful contributions to advancing one-stage temporal action detection.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions at the end of the paper:

- Improving localization accuracy for extremely long action instances, as their analysis shows lower performance on this subset. They suggest further exploration is needed for very long and complex actions.

- Reducing false positives, especially background errors and wrong label errors, to improve classification accuracy. Their error analysis shows these are still significant sources of errors.

- Enhancing the feature representation and modeling capability specifically for the boundary regions. They propose relative boundary modeling as a step in this direction, but further improvements could be made. 

- Exploring more efficient attention mechanisms or transformers tailored for temporal action detection, to reduce computational overhead while retaining strong performance. Their work demonstrates the possibility for efficient convolutional approaches.

- Applying the proposed techniques to other related tasks such as temporal grounding or action segmentation. The relative boundary modeling and efficient feature pyramid have potential for broader impact.

- Leveraging more advanced backbone networks as they continue to develop, to further boost accuracy. They show gains from using SlowFast, indicating potential with better base features.

Overall, the main suggestions are improving localization and classification, especially for challenging cases, enhancing boundary feature representations, developing more efficient transformer architectures, and extending the approach to related tasks and leveraging advances in backbone networks. The paper provides a solid baseline and analysis to inform promising research directions in temporal action detection.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper presents a temporal action detection method called TriDet. The key problems and questions it aims to address are:

- Imprecise boundary localization for actions in videos. The authors point out that unlike objects in images, action boundaries in videos are often ambiguous and not clearly defined. Existing methods struggle to precisely localize the start and end times of actions. 

- Limitations of transformer-based feature pyramids in prior work. The paper argues that self-attention in transformers leads to rank loss and high computational complexity for feature pyramid networks in temporal action detection. 

- How to effectively utilize boundary information for precise localization. The paper proposes that relative intensity response around predicted boundaries can help mitigate uncertainty and inaccuracies.

To address these issues, the main contributions of the paper are:

- A Trident head module to model action boundaries based on relative probability distributions, rather than regressing from single points.

- A Scalable Granularity Perception (SGP) module to replace transformer blocks in the feature pyramid, avoiding rank loss and being more efficient. 

- Combining the Trident head and SGP-based feature pyramid in an end-to-end trainable detection network called TriDet.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of TriDet on multiple action detection benchmarks while having lower computational cost than previous methods.

In summary, the key focus is improving localization accuracy and efficiency for temporal action detection via relative boundary modeling and a custom convolutional feature pyramid.
