# [TriDet: Temporal Action Detection with Relative Boundary Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07347)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key points are:- The paper aims to develop an improved one-stage framework for temporal action detection called TriDet. The main research goals are to:1) Improve action boundary localization by modeling the relative response intensity around the boundary rather than directly regressing the offsets. This is done through a proposed Trident-head module.2) Design an efficient feature pyramid module that can capture multi-scale temporal information without the issues of self-attention like rank loss and high complexity. This is done through a proposed Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer. - The central hypothesis seems to be that modeling action boundaries based on relative probabilities between adjacent snippets and using a convolutional feature pyramid can lead to improved efficiency and accuracy compared to prior approaches for temporal action detection.- Specifically, the Trident-head aims to address the problem of imprecise boundary localization in other methods by considering the relative probabilities of being a boundary for neighboring snippets. - The SGP layer in the feature pyramid aims to capture multi-scale information efficiently without the rank loss and complexity issues of self-attention.So in summary, the key research goals are developing the Trident-head and SGP layer to improve localization and efficiency for one-stage temporal action detection. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance which supports the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
