# [Exemplar-Free Continual Transformer with Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11357)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop an effective approach for continual learning with vision transformers that does not require storing exemplars and can operate without explicit task identifiers during inference?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Convolutional manipulation of transformer weights can enable effective adaptation to new tasks with low overhead.2) An entropy-based criterion for inferring task identity from augmented views of the test image can allow task-agnostic inference. The authors propose a new continual learning approach called ConTraCon that aims to address the lack of research on continually learning vision transformers without exemplar storage or task identifiers. Their method leverages convolution on transformer weights for task adaptation and an augmentation-based entropy criterion for task inference. The experiments aim to validate if this approach can enable competitive continual learning performance in transformers without the usual requirements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes ConTraCon, a new approach for continual learning with vision transformers. ConTraCon allows the model to expand and adapt to new tasks while maintaining performance on previous tasks, without needing to store examples from previous tasks.- It introduces a method to adapt the weights of a pretrained transformer to new tasks using convolution operations. This allows adapting to new tasks with minimal increase in parameters. - It uses a learnable temporal skip gating to balance between retaining previous knowledge and adapting to the new task. - It proposes an entropy-based approach to predict the task identity at test time without requiring explicit task labels. This allows the method to work in class incremental learning scenarios.- It evaluates ConTraCon extensively on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, TinyImageNet and compares with state-of-the-art approaches. The results show ConTraCon outperforms previous continual learning approaches for vision transformers while using fewer parameters.- It performs ablation studies to analyze the contribution of different components of ConTraCon like the convolutional kernels, skip gating, task prediction with augmentation, etc.In summary, the key contribution is a new continual learning approach for vision transformers that can expand to learn new tasks efficiently while retaining previous knowledge, without needing exemplar storage or task labels at test time. The convolutional weight adaptation and entropy-based task prediction are the main novel aspects.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other related research:- The paper proposes a new approach called ConTraCon for continual learning with vision transformers. Most prior work on continual learning has focused on convolutional neural networks, so exploring transformers for continual learning is novel.- The approach is "exemplar-free" meaning it does not require storing examples from previous tasks. Many prior continual learning methods rely on rehearsing or replaying old examples to prevent catastrophic forgetting, so not needing to store examples is a advantage.- The approach adapts a pretrained transformer to new tasks using convolution operations on the attention weights. This allows efficiently adapting the pretrained model to new tasks with minimal overhead. Other methods like DyTox and LVT also adapt transformers for continual learning but require more parameters.- A novel entropy-based criterion is used for task inference when task IDs are not provided at test time. This allows the method to work in challenging class incremental learning scenarios without task IDs. Other transformer continual learning methods like MEAT require task IDs.- Experiments across 4 datasets show ConTraCon outperforms state-of-the-art transformer continual learning methods like DyTox and LVT, despite being exemplar-free and using fewer parameters. It also outperforms many convolutional network based continual learning methods.Overall, the paper introduces a novel and efficient approach for adapting vision transformers to continual learning. The exemplar-free capability and strong empirical performance are notable contributions compared to prior art. The entropy-based task inference also addresses a key challenge in class incremental learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring other ways to manipulate transformer weights for continual learning besides convolution, such as using attention or sparse matrices. The authors mention convolution provides a cheap way to modify the weights, but other approaches may work as well or better.- Investigating different approaches for task identification during inference in class incremental learning scenarios. The authors propose using an entropy-based criterion by looking at agreement between augmented views of the test image, but other methods could be explored. - Applying the proposed approach to other transformer architectures besides CCT, such as ViT, DeiT, Swin Transformers etc. The authors use CCT due to its compact nature, but evaluating with other transformers would be interesting.- Evaluating the approach on larger scale and more complex datasets. The authors test on several benchmark datasets, but applying it to larger datasets like full ImageNet or complex video/sequence tasks could be valuable.- Combining rehearsal strategies with the proposed approach by storing a small number of samples, and studying the trade-offs. The authors' method is exemplar-free but allowing some memory could help further.- Exploring semi-supervised or transfer learning settings for the continual learning scenario. The current work focuses on a fully supervised learning setting.- Developing theoretical analyses to better understand stability-plasticity of the model and how the convolutions help prevent catastrophic forgetting.In summary, the authors propose several promising future work directions focused on architecture choices, task inference, applying to larger datasets, incorporating rehearsal strategies, and developing more theoretical understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes ConTraCon, an exemplar-free continual learning approach for vision transformers. The key ideas are:1) It uses convolution operations to adapt the key, query, and value weights of a pretrained transformer when learning new tasks. This allows new task knowledge to be incorporated with minimal parameters. 2) A learnable skip gating mechanism is used to balance between retaining prior knowledge and learning new information. 3) During inference, an entropy-based criterion is used to predict task identity without requiring explicit task labels. Multiple augmented views of the test image are evaluated and the task giving the lowest entropy (highest confidence) prediction is selected.4) Experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, TinyImageNet and 5 datasets show ConTraCon outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning approaches including rehearsal-based methods. It does so with significantly fewer parameters and without needing exemplar storage. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the different components.In summary, ConTraCon demonstrates an effective way to enable vision transformers to incrementally learn new tasks while retaining prior knowledge, using efficient convolutional adaptation and entropy-based task inference. The results show promising performance compared to existing continual learning techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new exemplar-free approach for class/task incremental learning called ConTraCon, which does not require task-id explicitly during inference and avoids storing previous training instances. The proposed approach leverages the transformer architecture and involves re-weighting the key, query, and value weights of the multi-head self-attention layers of a transformer trained on a similar task. The re-weighting is done using convolution, which enables maintaining low parameter requirements per task. Additionally, an image augmentation-based entropic task identification approach is used to predict tasks without requiring task-ids during inference. The proposed ConTraCon approach creates multiple augmented views of a test image and evaluates the agreement of their predictions among different task-specific models. The task-id is determined by identifying the task giving the lowest entropy value of the average predictions from the various augmented views. The task-specific model with the most consistent and confident predictions across augmentations corresponds to the correct task. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over several competitive methods including extensions of popular approaches to transformers. Despite being exemplar-free, ConTraCon outperforms exemplar-based methods and accomplishes this with fewer parameters.
