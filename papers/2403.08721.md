# [Historical Astronomical Diagrams Decomposition in Geometric Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08721)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are hundreds of thousands of historical astronomical diagrams in digitized manuscripts, but automatically extracting their geometric content is challenging for current methods. 
- State-of-the-art vectorization methods struggle with the complexity and diversity of historical diagrams. 
- Most approaches focus on detecting only a single primitive type (e.g. lines).

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a dataset of 303 annotated historical diagrams from diverse traditions and time periods.
- They propose a transformer-based model built on DETR that can jointly predict multiple geometric primitives - lines, circles and arcs.
- The model refines primitive parameters iteratively in the decoder using deformable attention. This speeds up training convergence and enables precise localization.
- The model is trained solely on synthetic diagram data and generalizes to real historical diagrams.

Main Contributions:
- Novel dataset of 303 historical astronomical diagrams with over 3000 annotated primitives.
- Vectorization model that jointly handles multiple primitives and refines parameters iteratively.
- Demonstration that the model, trained only on synthetic data, achieves strong performance on real historical diagrams.
- Significant improvements over SOTA line detection methods like LETR in terms of both accuracy and inference speed.

In summary, the paper introduces a unique dataset to promote research on diagram analysis, and proposes an accurate vectorization model tailored to the complexity of historical astronomical diagrams. The iterative parameter refinement scheme is generalizable to other primitives and vectorization tasks.
