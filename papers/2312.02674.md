# [Amortized Bayesian Decision Making for simulation-based models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02674)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two methods, NPE-MC and BAM, for performing amortized Bayesian decision making with simulation-based models. The goal is to select optimal actions that minimize expected costs, averaged over the posterior distribution of model parameters given observed data. NPE-MC uses neural posterior estimation to approximate the posterior, then estimates expected costs via Monte Carlo sampling. However, this can be inaccurate if the posterior approximation is poor, and computationally expensive if the cost function is complex. BAM circumvents explicitly estimating the posterior, instead training a neural network to directly predict expected costs for any data-action pair. On several benchmark tasks, BAM achieves substantially lower incurred costs compared to NPE-MC, especially for complex nonlinear simulators where posterior approximation is difficult. The methods are also demonstrated on a real-world medical neuroscience simulator for determining treatments for epileptic patients. Key advantages of BAM are better performance when the posterior is hard to estimate, and avoiding expensive per-observation cost function evaluations. The choice between NPE-MC and BAM depends on factors like posterior complexity, cost function expense, and whether the full posterior or only decisions are needed.
