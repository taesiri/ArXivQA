# [Why are hyperbolic neural networks effective? A study on hierarchical   representation capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02478)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have shown great promise for handling hierarchical data, purportedly due to the optimal hierarchical representation capability (HRC) of hyperbolic spaces. However, there is no evidence that HNNs actually achieve this theoretical optimal embedding. 
- The effectiveness of HNNs is typically attributed solely to the HRC of hyperbolic spaces, but many factors likely influence their performance. A proper benchmark and analysis is lacking to understand why HNNs are effective.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Hierarchical Representation Capability Benchmark (HRCB) to quantitatively evaluate the HRC of HNNs. 
- HRCB consists of four metrics to measure hierarchy preservation w.r.t. root node, origin, parent node, and sibling nodes.
- HRCB also defines metrics to characterize hierarchical data structures.
- Using HRCB, the authors systematically analyze the HRC of HNNs under varying optimization objectives, data structures, etc.
- Based on the analysis, the authors propose pre-training strategies to enhance HRC and downstream performance.

Main Contributions:
- HRCB enables analyzing and comparing the HRC of different HNN methods. This sheds light on why HNNs are effective in practice.
- The analysis shows HNNs do not achieve the theoretic optimal HRC, and their HRC depends significantly on the optimization objective and data structure.
- Enhancing HRC through pre-training can boost downstream task performance. This further proves the analysis results using HRCB.
- The paper provides one of the first empirical analyses on why HNNs are effective, the factors influencing their capability, and how to improve HNNs based on these insights.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposal of HRCB to analyze HNNs, the findings from experiments using HRCB, and strategies to enhance HNNs based on those findings.
