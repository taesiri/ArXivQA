# [Scaling Data Generation in Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15644)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we scale up the training data for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents to improve their performance and generalization ability?The key points are:- VLN agents need a large amount of diverse visual-language data for learning, but existing VLN datasets are limited in the number of environments and trajectory-instruction demonstrations. - The paper proposes an effective paradigm to generate a large-scale augmented dataset by utilizing additional 3D environments from HM3D and Gibson datasets.- The paper comprehensively analyzes the effect of each component in the data augmentation pipeline, including navigation graph construction, image recovery, trajectory sampling, and instruction generation. - Experiments show the augmented data can significantly boost VLN agent performance on multiple benchmarks and help the model generalize better to unseen environments. - The paper also investigates how to appropriately leverage the large-scale augmented data in pre-training and fine-tuning the agent.In summary, the central hypothesis is that providing more diverse environments and supervision at scale is crucial for training generalized VLN agents, and the paper proposes and validates an effective data augmentation approach to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing an effective paradigm for large-scale data augmentation for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). The method utilizes over 1200 environments from HM3D and Gibson datasets to generate nearly 5 million instruction-trajectory pairs for training VLN agents. 2. Providing a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the various components of the data augmentation pipeline, including navigation graph construction, image recovery, trajectory sampling, and instruction generation. This analysis provides insights into what factors matter most for generating effective augmented data.3. Achieving new state-of-the-art results on several VLN benchmark datasets, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN and R2R-CE. The large-scale augmented data allows the agent to reach 80% success rate on the R2R test set, approaching human performance.4. Demonstrating that the discrete augmented data can also improve performance on navigation in continuous environments.5. Providing useful guidelines and insights on how to create and effectively utilize large-scale augmented data for training vision-and-language navigation agents.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and thoroughly evaluating an effective large-scale data augmentation paradigm for VLN. The comprehensive analysis and new state-of-the-art results validate the effectiveness of the approach. The work also offers valuable insights into data augmentation for VLN that can inform future research.
