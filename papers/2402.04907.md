# [On a Combinatorial Problem Arising in Machine Teaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies a model of machine teaching where the teacher mapping is constructed from size functions on concepts and examples. The main question is: what is the minimum number of examples (teaching dimension) needed to teach any concept from a concept class C? The authors refer to recent work (Greedy algorithm paper) that conjectured that the worst-case teaching dimension occurs when the consistency matrix contains the binary representations of integers from 0 to |C|-1. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors prove this conjecture, showing that the binary matrix H_{n,k} with rows as binary representations of numbers from 0 to k-1 minimizes the teaching dimension. Their proof relies on results about the edge isoperimetry problem on hypercubes and a lemma from an old paper by Graham.

Main Contributions:

- Formal statement of the combinatorial optimization problem of minimizing the teaching dimension. Defining m_q(M) as the key metric.

- Showing that a stronger theorem (Theorem 3.1) would imply the main result (Theorem 2.1) about the conjecture.

- Proving the stronger Theorem 3.1 using several new lemmas about properties of Hamming weights, extending a prior result by Graham.

- Settling the conjecture by showing matrix H_{n,k} minimizes teaching dimension. This generalizes the known result about edge isoperimetry of hypercubes.

- Giving a method to analyze performance of Greedy algorithm by focusing on m_q(M). Leave open if computing m_q(M) is fixed parameter tractable.

In summary, the paper makes theoretical contributions in an open machine teaching problem, proving a recent conjecture and providing tools to further analyze the model.
