# [ViewFusion: Learning Composable Diffusion Models for Novel View   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02906)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Novel view synthesis aims to generate new views of a scene from a set of input views. Traditional approaches like voxel grids, point clouds, and meshes require explicit 3D modeling which can be difficult and costly. Recent neural approaches like NeRFs have limitations - they require abundant pose-labeled training data per scene, do not handle occlusion well, and cannot adapt the number of input views. End-to-end approaches also have limitations - they are deterministic and cannot produce a variety of plausible views when parts of the target view are occluded.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes ViewFusion, an end-to-end generative approach to novel view synthesis based on composable diffusion models. The key ideas are:

1) Apply parallel diffusion denoising to each input view to get noise predictions and learned per-pixel weighting masks indicating view informativeness. 

2) At each denoising timestep, compose the noise predictions into a weighted sum using the masks to retain only useful information from each view.

3) Iteratively denoise over timesteps to produce the final target view.

This allows handling an arbitrary number of unordered, pose-free views at train and test time. The generative modeling accounts for uncertainty in occluded regions by producing varied plausible views.

Contributions:

1) A novel yet intuitive approach to novel view synthesis using composable diffusion paired with a learned weighting mechanism over input views.

2) High flexibility - can process pose-free, unordered variable number of views without retraining. Generalizes over multiple scenes and classes.

3) Handles severely occluded target views by generating multiple varied plausible views.

4) Achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art image quality while offering more flexibility than current approaches.

Limitations include slow inference, lack of explicit 3D structure, and testing on a small dataset. Future work includes latent space modeling and more realistic datasets. The approach offers applications in VR/AR and occlusion handling.
