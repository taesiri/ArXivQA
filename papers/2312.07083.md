# [GNBG: A Generalized and Configurable Benchmark Generator for Continuous   Numerical Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07083)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG), a novel and configurable tool for generating customizable benchmark problem instances to evaluate optimization algorithms. GNBG employs a single parametric baseline function capable of producing a diverse range of test problems with controllable characteristics like dimensionality, conditioning, modality, variable interactions, symmetry, and deception. Unlike traditional benchmark suites based on multiple mathematical functions, GNBG allows fine-grained control over instance features to enable targeted testing of algorithms. The authors demonstrate GNBG's capabilities in shaping critical problem attributes and conducting an initial study on how these characteristics impact three optimization algorithms' performance. They highlight the tool's utility in exposing algorithmic weaknesses and strengths under adjustable conditions. While preliminary, this exploration underscores GNBG's potential as an impactful benchmarking platform to systematically develop better algorithms. The authors posit that comprehensive future analyses across more algorithms and instance types will further validate GNBG's usefulness. In summary, GNBG promises to significantly advance benchmarking and optimization research through its configurability, diversity, scalability, and controllability.
