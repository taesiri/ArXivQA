# [Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we develop a systematic conceptual framework to understand and guide the design of language agents?

The authors note that while language agents built using large language models have achieved substantial empirical success recently, there is a lack of an overarching theoretical perspective to organize different agents and plan future developments. 

To address this, the authors propose a framework called Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA). The key components of CoALA include:

- Memory modules (working, episodic, semantic, procedural) 

- An action space divided into internal (reasoning, retrieval, learning) and external (grounding) actions

- A decision-making process structured as repeated cycles of planning (proposing and evaluating actions) and execution.

The authors argue that CoALA provides a useful blueprint based on concepts from cognitive science and AI history to retrospectively survey existing agents and prospectively suggest future directions. The framework aims to provide common terminology to compare different agents, reveal similarities and differences in their designs, and systematically expand their capabilities.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the CoALA framework will lead to more structured understanding and engineering of language agents compared to existing ad-hoc approaches. The authors attempt to support this claim by using CoALA to analyze a diverse set of recent agents and identify promising research directions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing the CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents) framework to systematically understand and build language agents. Specifically:

- The paper draws parallels between production systems and cognitive architectures from classic AI, and modern large language models and language agents. This motivates using principles from cognitive architectures to design language agents.

- It introduces the CoALA framework that structures language agents along three key dimensions: information storage in memory modules, action spaces for interacting with internal memories and external environments, and a decision procedure based on repeated cycles of planning and execution. 

- The paper uses CoALA to organize and compare a diverse set of recent language agents, demonstrating its utility as a unifying conceptual framework. 

- It suggests directions for future work by identifying gaps in current agents based on the CoALA taxonomy, such as integrating retrieval with decision-making, meta-learning by modifying agent code, and more complex deliberative decision-making.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing CoALA as a theoretical framework grounded in cognitive science to systematically conceptualize, organize, and guide research on language agents. The paper demonstrates its utility through comparisons of existing methods and identification of open problems and future directions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in artificial intelligence for language agents:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing the Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA) framework for systematically designing and understanding language agents. This framework draws on concepts from the history of cognitive architectures in AI, and applies them to modern language agents based on large language models (LLMs). 

In particular, CoALA structures agents in terms of memory modules, action spaces, and decision procedures. It suggests agents should have separate working memory and long-term episodic, semantic, and procedural memories. The action space should include internal reasoning, retrieval, and learning actions, as well as external actions for interacting with the world. Decision-making should follow a deliberate cycle of proposing, evaluating, and selecting actions based on planning. 

The paper reviews a wide variety of recent language agents and shows how CoALA expresses their designs in a simple, unified way. It also uses CoALA to suggest future directions around topics like meta-learning, integrating retrieval and reasoning, safety considerations, and more sophisticated decision procedures.

Compared to other surveys of language agents, this paper takes a more theoretical perspective grounded in cognitive architectures. Other surveys focus more narrowly on prompt engineering methods or empirical results. The CoALA framework is novel in providing an overarching structure for agent design.

The paper also differs from other theoretical proposals on cognitive architectures or general intelligence. Those works tend to focus on biological plausibility or specific mechanisms like working memory. In contrast, this paper aims to provide immediately practical guidance for engineering more capable language agents. 

Overall, this paper makes a unique contribution in bridging the practical development of language agents with insights from the history of AI and cognitive science. The CoALA framework synthesizes these perspectives to provide both theoretical grounding and engineering guidance for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing standardized agent design frameworks, terminology, and implementations to facilitate modular and systematic language agent development, both in research and industry applications. This includes defining useful abstractions for memory, actions, and decision-making.

- Using prompting frameworks and structural output parsing to enable more structured reasoning actions, instead of low-level prompt engineering. Also shaping LLM training based on reasoning use cases in agents.

- Studying agents with long-term memory capabilities beyond fixed corpora retrieval, including combining human knowledge with agent experience, and better integrating retrieval with reasoning and planning.

- Exploring new forms of learning, such as procedural meta-learning to modify agent code, studying interaction effects between multiple learning approaches, and incorporating deletion/unlearning.

- Defining suitable external and internal action spaces to inform agent design. Considering action space size and safety. Going beyond just external tool use.

- Developing more sophisticated decision-making procedures that propose, evaluate and select actions via a mix of language-based reasoning and code-based planning. Extending deliberative reasoning to real-world tasks. Adding mechanisms for metareasoning and computational efficiency. Addressing issues like miscalibration for better alignment.

In summary, the authors lay out both concrete short-term suggestions based on the CoALA framework, as well as thought-provoking questions to motivate bolder goals for developing more general, human-like language agent intelligence in the long run.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA), a conceptual framework for understanding and developing language agents based on principles from cognitive science and symbolic artificial intelligence. CoALA structures language agents into modular components including working memory, long-term episodic/semantic/procedural memories, reasoning/retrieval/learning/grounding actions, and a decision loop. It provides a way to retrospectively survey and organize recent language agent work, identifying gaps and future directions. CoALA connects the history of production systems and cognitive architectures to modern language models, proposing they have analogous capabilities for string manipulation and control flow. It suggests that principles from cognitive architectures can complement LLMs' limitations in explainability and systematicity. Overall, CoALA aims to provide a path towards more general and human-like artificial intelligence by combining symbolic AI with modern neural methods. The paper uses CoALA to organize existing agents, study prominent examples, and suggest next steps for memory, reasoning, learning, action spaces, and decision-making.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA), a conceptual framework for systematically understanding and building language agents. Language agents leverage large language models (LLMs) as a core component to interact with the world. The CoALA framework draws parallels between production systems and LLMs, showing how concepts from the history of cognitive architectures can be usefully applied to structure modern LLM-based agents. 

CoALA organizes agents along three key dimensions: information storage divided into working memory and long-term episodic, semantic, and procedural memories; action spaces containing external grounding actions and internal reasoning, retrieval, and learning actions; and a structured decision procedure that repeatedly plans, selects, and executes actions in a loop with the external environment. The authors use CoALA to survey a wide variety of recent language agents, revealing similarities and differences in their designs. They suggest the framework provides a systematic lens to understand existing work and propose future directions around topics like memory, reasoning, learning, action spaces, and decision making procedures. Overall, CoALA offers a theoretical grounding to connect today's data-driven language agents to the symbolic AI tradition.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA), a conceptual framework for understanding and developing language agents based on large language models (LLMs). CoALA draws inspiration from decades of research on cognitive architectures for AI systems. It structures language agents in terms of memory, action spaces, and decision procedures. Memory is divided into working memory and long-term memories (episodic, semantic, procedural). The action space consists of internal reasoning/retrieval/learning actions that operate on memory, and external grounding actions for interacting with the environment. Decision-making follows a repeated cycle: using reasoning and retrieval to propose and evaluate candidate actions during a planning stage, selecting one action to execute, then looping again. By organizing recent empirical work into this framework, the authors provide a systematic perspective connecting historical AI research to modern language models, and suggest promising directions for developing more capable language agents.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is proposing a conceptual framework called "Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents" (CoALA) to help systematically understand and develop language agents. 

The key problem it is trying to address is that while language agents have achieved great empirical success recently, there is a lack of systematic theoretical frameworks to organize existing agents and guide future developments. The paper draws connections between language models and production systems from the history of AI, and uses concepts from cognitive architectures to propose CoALA as a unifying framework.

Specifically, CoALA organizes agents along three main dimensions: their memory components, action space, and decision-making procedure. It uses these concepts to retrospectively survey and categorize existing language agents, as well as prospectively suggest future directions and open questions.

Overall, the paper aims to provide a theoretical lens to contextualize the current progress on language agents within the broader history of AI, as well as offer a path towards developing more capable and human-like artificial intelligence systems. The CoALA framework helps organize diverse empirical works, grounds the theory in existing practices, and identifies both short-term engineering insights and long-term research directions.
