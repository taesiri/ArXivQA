# [Beyond Recommender: An Exploratory Study of the Effects of Different AI   Roles in AI-Assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01791)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- In existing AI-assisted decision making systems, AI mainly plays the role of a "recommender", providing suggestions and explanations. However, this can diminish humans' analytical thinking and lead to inappropriate over-reliance or under-reliance on AI.  
- In contrast, human advisors in group decision-making can take on diverse roles beyond recommender, such as analyzing options or critiquing the decision-maker. The effects of AI playing such alternative roles have not been studied. 

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a user study to examine three AI roles - Recommender, Analyzer, and Devil's Advocate.
- Recommender provides recommendations and explanations. 
- Analyzer assists in weighing pros and cons of each option.
- Devil's Advocate argues against the user's initial choice.
- Also test two levels of AI accuracy - high (90%) and low (65%).
- Evaluate the effects on task performance, reliance appropriateness, and user experience.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates that the recommender role is not always most effective, especially with low AI accuracy. The analyzer role can improve performance and appropriate reliance.
- Different roles exhibit distinct tradeoffs - recommender causes over-reliance but improves adoption of correct AI advice. Devil's advocate reduces over-reliance but increases under-reliance. 
- With high AI accuracy, recommender and analyzer improve user experience. With low accuracy, analyzer leads to better experience.
- Overall, adaptively selecting AI's role based on its confidence can be an effective strategy. The choice should also depend on objectives regarding performance, reliance issues, and user experience.

In summary, the key insight is that the optimal AI role depends on factors like AI accuracy, task objectives, etc. The recommender role predominant in existing systems has limitations. Exploring diverse AI roles opens up new possibilities for more effective and ethical AI assistance.
