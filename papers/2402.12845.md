# [MORE-3S:Multimodal-based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Shared   Semantic Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from fixed datasets without environmental interaction. However, current approaches have limitations in effectively utilizing large pretrained language models (LPMs) to enhance high-level planning. 

- It is unclear how to align the latent state representations from images, discrete action spaces, and their textual descriptions to allow better understanding of states and actions. This alignment could enhance RL agents' decision-making.

Method:
- The paper proposes MORE-3S, a novel Multimodal Offline Reinforcement Learning approach using Shared Semantic Spaces.

- It integrates a multimodal model (LXMERT) to encode visual state inputs and textual action inputs into a shared embedding.

- The multimodal embeddings are input to a transformer-based sequence model that autoregressively predicts future actions. 

- A memory mechanism incorporates the return-to-go into the sequence model's attention to enhance long-term planning.

Contributions:
- MORE-3S demonstrates strong performance on Atari games and Mujoco environments, outperforming prior offline RL algorithms.

- It offers a new perspective that aligning representations across modalities (states, actions, text) facilitates agents' understanding and decision-making.

- The integration of return-to-go into the transformer attention is a novel way to improve these models for long-term planning in RL.

In summary, MORE-3S advances offline RL by an innovative alignment of multimodal embeddings using LPMs. The implicit grounding in semantic spaces and long-term memory mechanism allow better generalization and interpretability.
