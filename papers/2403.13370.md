# [Counting Network for Learning from Majority Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper proposes a new problem in multi-class multiple instance learning (MIL) called "Learning from the Majority Label" (LML). In LML, only the majority class label of the instances in a bag is provided during training. The goal is to train a model to classify individual instances using these bag-level majority labels. This is a valuable but challenging problem since the instance-level labels are unknown. Existing MIL methods have issues with LML: they aggregate instance confidences in ways inconsistent with counting instances, leading to poor instance classification.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a "counting network" for LML. It has two components:

1) Instance Classifier: Uses a softmax temperature to constrain estimated instance labels to 0/1 pseudo-labels indicating whether the instance belongs to a class.  

2) Bag Classifier: Sums the pseudo-label outputs to count instances in each class. The class with the highest count is predicted as the bag's majority label. A temperature-controlled softmax makes this differentiable.

The network is trained with cross-entropy loss between the predicted majority class and the actual majority class. This encourages consistency between counting instances and predicting the bag's label.

Contributions:
- Formalizes the new LML problem for multi-class MIL
- Proposes a counting network tailored for LML using temperature-controlled softening
- Shows logically and empirically that existing MIL methods are inconsistent for LML 
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of the counting network on 4 datasets, significantly outperforming existing MIL techniques

In summary, the paper identifies an important new MIL problem and provides an effective deep learning solution using differentiable counting. Experiments validate the approach over strong baselines.
