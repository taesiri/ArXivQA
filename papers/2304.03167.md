# [CloSET: Modeling Clothed Humans on Continuous Surface with Explicit   Template Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03167)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we effectively model clothing deformation and geometry for animating 3D clothed humans in different poses?

The key points related to this question are:

- Traditional methods for animating clothed humans like skinning and physics simulation have limitations in capturing realistic clothing details and pose-dependent deformations. 

- Existing learning-based methods have difficulties generalizing to unseen poses due to limitations in the clothing representation (meshes, implicit fields, point clouds) and not fully disentangling clothing deformations.

- This paper proposes a new point-based method called CloSET that decomposes clothing deformations into explicit garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles to better model pose-dependent geometry. 

- It also proposes learning point features on a continuous body surface to enable fine detail modeling without discontinuity artifacts.

- A new clothed human scan dataset is introduced to facilitate research in this direction.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by disentangling clothing deformation into garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles and learning continuous surface features, their method CloSET can more effectively model clothed human geometry and deformations for animation in different poses. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a point-based method for modeling clothed humans that decomposes clothing deformations into explicit garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles in an end-to-end manner. The explicit garment templates provide a garment-aware canonical space so that pose-dependent deformations can be better learned and applied to unseen poses. 

2. It proposes to learn point-based clothing features on a continuous body surface, rather than a UV map. This allows for a continuous feature space to capture fine details and long-range part correlations for pose-dependent geometry. 

3. It introduces a new high-quality scan dataset of humans in diverse real-world clothing to facilitate research on clothed human modeling from scans.

In summary, the main novelty is in the explicit template decomposition and continuous surface feature learning to better model pose-dependent clothing deformations for animating clothed humans. The new dataset also helps push progress in this direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a point-based method to model clothed humans by decomposing clothing deformations into explicit garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles learned on a continuous body surface, and introduces a new dataset of high-quality scans of humans wearing real-world clothing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points on how this paper compares to other research in modeling pose-dependent clothing deformations:

- Representation: It uses point clouds to represent clothing, following recent works like SCALE, POP, and FITE. This allows flexibility in topology compared to meshes. It proposes learning features on the body surface for continuity, unlike UV maps used in SCALE and POP. 

- Modeling: It decomposes clothing into explicit garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles. This is different from works that model on a fixed template mesh or implicit shape. It allows better learning of wrinkles. FITE also uses explicit templates but requires a two-step procedure.  

- Dataset: It introduces a new high-quality scan dataset (THuman-CloSET) of real loose clothing across poses. Existing datasets either use tight clothing or synthetic data. This facilitates research on real-world clothing.

- Performance: It shows improved quantitative and qualitative results compared to recent state-of-the-art methods like SCALE, POP, SCANimate, and SNARF on existing and the new proposed dataset. The decomposition and continuous surface features help achieve this.

- Limitations: It shares limitations of point-based methods like non-uniformities in skirts. Combining with skinning or physics-based losses could help. Lacks temporal consistency enforcement across poses.

Overall, it pushes the state-of-the-art in point-based modeling of clothing using novel explicit decomposition and continuous surface features. The new challenging dataset also enables future research in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Combining their method with recent learnable skinning solutions like SCANimate and SkiRT to improve the results, especially for skirts/dresses where there can still be issues with non-uniform point distribution due to incorrect skinning weights in the template. 

- Enforcing temporal consistency and correspondences between adjacent frames/poses, rather than just modeling each pose independently. This could help improve realism and smoothness when animating sequences of poses.

- Incorporating physics-based losses (e.g. from SNUG) into the learning process to help address artifacts like self-intersections in the predicted clothing geometry.

- Exploring different network architectures, like PointMLP and PointNeXt, for the pose/garment encoders instead of PointNet++.

- Leveraging information from multiple observations of the same outfit in different poses during training to help learn better canonical space deformations.

- Extending the approach to model hair and face details in addition to clothing.

- Applying the method to model dynamic motions and cloth animations, not just static poses.

So in summary, they point to improving the realism, consistency, and generalization of the pose-dependent clothing deformation modeling by integrating physics-based terms, introducing temporal information, exploring better network architectures, and expanding the scope to full bodies, motions, etc. The new dataset could also enable future research in many of these directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes CloSET, a point-based method for modeling clothed humans that learns to decompose clothing deformations into explicit garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles. The method represents clothing as point clouds and learns features on a continuous body surface, avoiding discontinuities between body parts in UV mapping approaches. It decomposes deformations into a garment-related template that is shared across poses and pose-dependent displacements added on top. This allows better learning and generalization of pose-dependent wrinkles. The method is validated on existing datasets and a newly introduced dataset THuman-CloSET containing over 2000 high-quality scans of humans in diverse real-world clothing. Results show CloSET produces better clothing deformation on unseen poses compared to previous methods. Limitations include suboptimal point distributions for skirts/dresses due to incorrect skinning weights and lack of temporal consistency. Future work could combine CloSET with learned skinning and physics-based losses to further improve realism.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes CloSET, a method for modeling clothed humans in different poses using point clouds. The key idea is to decompose clothing deformations into explicit garment templates that are shared across poses, and pose-dependent wrinkles that capture how the clothing deforms in different poses. 

To achieve this, the method learns pose features and garment features on the surface of an underlying body model. These features are learned in a continuous manner using hierarchical point-based networks, allowing fine details to be captured while also modeling long-range correlations. The features are then fed into separate decoders that output the garment template displacements and pose-dependent displacements. A key benefit is that modeling the pose-dependent wrinkles on top of explicit garment templates helps disentangle clothing deformations, enabling better generalization to unseen poses. Experiments show the approach can model complex real-world clothing and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The paper also contributes a new high-quality scan dataset of humans in diverse real-world outfits to facilitate further research.

In summary, the key ideas are learning continuous hierarchical features on the body surface, decomposing clothing into explicit garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles, and introducing a new challenging real-world scan dataset. The approach shows improved modeling of clothing details and pose-dependent deformations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes CloSET, a point-based method for modeling clothed humans that decomposes clothing deformations into explicit garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles. The key ideas are: 1) Learning continuous surface features on a body template using PointNet++ to enable fine detail modeling and capture long-range part correlations. Features are sampled via barycentric interpolation. 2) Decomposing deformations into a shared garment template displacement and pose-dependent wrinkle displacement that are predicted by separate decoders. This disentangles clothing deformations to better learn pose-dependent wrinkles. 3) Transforming predicted displacements from local to world coordinates using transformations based on the body model. The method is trained using a data term matching predictions to scans and a regularization term to prevent extreme deformations. Experiments show CloSET captures better clothing details and pose-dependent wrinkles compared to state-of-the-art methods on existing datasets and a new real-world scan dataset introduced in the paper.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes CloSET, an end-to-end method to model clothed humans on a continuous surface with explicit template decomposition. CloSET represents the body as a point cloud and learns garment-related and pose-dependent features on the surface of a body template. These continuous surface features are then fed into two decoders to generate explicit garment templates and pose-dependent wrinkles, which are combined to produce the final clothed body point cloud. CloSET decomposes clothing deformations into shared garment templates and pose-dependent displacements, allowing better generalization to new poses. It also tackles artifacts from UV map discontinuities by using continuous surface features. The method is validated on existing datasets and a newly introduced high-quality scan dataset containing diverse real-world clothing. Experiments demonstrate CloSET's ability to produce natural clothing deformations and wrinkles in unseen poses.
