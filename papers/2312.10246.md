# [Implicit Modeling of Non-rigid Objects with Cross-Category Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Implicit Modeling of Non-Rigid Objects with Cross-Category Signals":

Problem:
- Prior deep implicit function (DIF) methods for 3D shape representation have focused on single object modeling. 
- Modeling multiple non-rigid objects is more complex due to needing to capture deformations and interactions between objects. Key challenges are:
   - Capturing varying deformation across object categories
   - Modeling interactions between non-rigid, non-interpenetrating objects like organs
   - Lack of multi-object training data

Proposed Solution:
- Propose MODIF, a multi-object deep implicit neural representation
   - Composed of sub-functions to model each object category and cross-category refinement
- Sub-functions based on DIF-Net capture per-category shapes
- Novel cross-category refinement mechanism uses signals between sub-functions to refine shapes
   - Captures interactions between objects
   - Reduces shape interpenetration
- Formulate novel inter-object supervision with attraction-repulsion loss to refine contact regions

Main Contributions:  
- Comprehensive implicit modeling of multiple non-rigid objects 
- Cross-category refinement using sub-function signals to capture object interactions and reduce intersections
- Inter-object supervision using attraction-repulsion loss to refine contact regions
- Simultaneous multi-category point correspondences while preserving geometry
- Can plausibly reconstruct missing objects in new instances by leveraging category knowledge and instance context
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on 3 medical benchmarks for tasks like shape reconstruction and missing object recovery

In summary, the paper introduces a novel structured deep implicit neural representation for multiple non-rigid objects that accounts for complex category-specific deformations and inter-object relations. The method achieves more accurate and consistent multi-object modeling compared to prior arts.
