# [Hybrid Functional Maps for Crease-Aware Non-Isometric Shape Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03678)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel hybrid functional mapping approach for establishing correspondences between non-rigid 3D shapes. The key idea is to construct a joint vector space between the intrinsic Laplace-Beltrami (LBO) eigenfunctions and the extrinsic eigenfunctions from the hessian of an elastic thin-shell energy. While LBO eigenfunctions enable coarse and robust matching, they fail to capture fine details like creases and bending. In contrast, the elastic eigenfunctions align well with such extrinsic features but lack robustness when used independently. To leverage the complementary strengths, the authors present a theoretically grounded framework to integrate non-orthogonal basis functions into descriptor- and learning-based pipelines. They formulate weighted variants of common functional map losses to account for the non-uniform Riemannian metric. Experiments across diverse settings - near-isometric, non-isometric, and topologically noisy - showcase significant improvements. Notably, the proposed hybrid approach reduces errors by up to 45% under topological variations and 15% in non-isometric matching compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
