# [Ever-Evolving Memory by Blending and Refining the Past](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04787)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Existing chatbot memory models have two key limitations: 
   1) They only consider the current conversation session when updating memory, leading to fragmented and disconnected information over time.  
   2) They accumulate outdated or contradictory information over long conversations.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes CREEM - a novel memory updating framework to create an "ever-evolving" memory for chatbots. The key ideas are:

- Blend past and present information when updating memory at each turn, ensuring continuity. 
- Refine existing memory by removing redundant or outdated information, maintaining consistency.

This leads to a dynamic, organized and conflict-free long term memory for improved conversation quality.

Technical Approach:
- Use ChatGPT to generate queries to retrieve relevant past memories
- Blend: Generate new insights by combining retrieved memories 
- Refine: Categorize new insights as "new", "redundant" or "updated" and remove contradicting past memories
- Add refined insights to memory after each turn  

Key Contributions:
- Identify core limitations of existing chatbot memory models 
- Propose CREEM, a new memory framework focused on blending and refining 
- Show CREEM memory is superior in integration, consistency, sophistication and conciseness
- Demonstrate improved chatbot response quality with CREEM memory, especially in consistency and memorability.

The paper makes notable contributions in evolving chatbot memory to be more human-like by ensuring it dynamically integrates new information while resolving conflicts. The refine process in particular helps avoid accumulating contradictory facts.
