# [DMSA -- Dense Multi Scan Adjustment for LiDAR Inertial Odometry and   Global Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19044)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate and robust trajectory estimation and mapping using LiDAR point clouds is an active research problem. Current challenges include achieving high accuracy (mm level), and increasing robustness in challenging conditions like narrow spaces, highly dynamic motions, and environments with many dynamic objects.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a new method called Dense Multi Scan Adjustment (DMSA) for fine registration of multiple point clouds simultaneously. 
- The key ideas are:
  - Merge points from all point clouds into one global point cloud, without establishing direct correspondences between clouds
  - Model the global cloud by dividing it into voxels and representing each voxel contents as a multivariate normal distribution
  - Iteratively optimize the alignment by minimizing the distances between points and distribution means, weighted by the inverse covariances
- This handles outliers and small overlaps robustly since no explicit correspondences are required
- Based on this, the authors propose a LiDAR Inertial Odometry method (DMSA-LIO) using DMSA for trajectory optimization in a sliding window, combined with IMU preintegration and gravity vector constraints
- They also extend DMSA for global keyframe pose graph optimization 

Main Contributions:
- A new method (DMSA) for robust dense multi-scan alignment and mapping without requiring explicit correspondences  
- DMSA-LIO: A highly accurate and robust LiDAR inertial odometry approach combining DMSA trajectory optimization with IMU integration
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in challenging real-world datasets with narrow spaces and dynamic motions, where other methods fail

The main highlights are the robustness and accuracy achieved via the dense correspondence-free modeling and optimization framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new dense multi scan adjustment method for LiDAR point clouds that represents point clouds with multivariate normal distributions, enabling efficient simultaneous alignment of multiple scans without direct correspondences, and shows this approach can be used for accurate and robust LiDAR inertial odometry and global map optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new method for dense multi scan adjustment called Dense Multi Scan Adjustment (DMSA). The key ideas of DMSA are:

- The environment is modeled with multivariate normal distributions instead of using predefined features like planes or edges. 

- There are no direct correspondences assumed between the point clouds to be registered. Instead, each point only corresponds to the normal distribution of its voxel. This reduces the number of correspondences and allows efficient optimization of multiple scans simultaneously.

- The normal distributions serve as adaptive weights during optimization. This makes the method robust against outliers from dynamic objects or small overlaps.

- Based on DMSA, the paper also proposes a LiDAR inertial odometry approach that performs continuous trajectory optimization in a sliding window manner.

- The paper shows that DMSA can also be used for global keyframe optimization to obtain highly accurate and consistent maps.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the dense multi scan adjustment method DMSA and showing its applications for robust and accurate LiDAR inertial odometry and global map optimization.

The paper proposes a new method called "Dense Multi Scan Adjustment" (DMSA) for registering multiple point clouds simultaneously in a dense manner, without reducing the clouds to specific features. This method is used to develop an accurate and robust LiDAR inertial odometry system, as well as methods for keyframe optimization. The core ideas include dividing point clouds into voxels/landmarks modeled by multivariate normal distributions, optimizing a continuous trajectory within a sliding window, and keyframe optimization after loop closures. Experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed DMSA-LIO method compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.
