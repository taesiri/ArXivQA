# [Controllable Text-to-Image Generation with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper aims to address is:How can large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 be leveraged to enhance the controllability and precision of text-to-image diffusion models? The paper introduces a framework called Control-GPT that integrates sketches generated by GPT-4 into the ControlNet architecture to guide text-to-image generation and improve models' ability to follow instructions. The central hypothesis is that incorporating programmatic sketches from GPT-4 as additional references alongside text prompts can help diffusion models better understand spatial relationships and generate images that align more closely with textual descriptions, especially for spatial and positional details.The key research contributions seem to be:- Proposing and evaluating a framework to integrate sketch generation abilities of LLMs like GPT-4 to guide and enhance controllability of diffusion models - Showing GPT-4 can generate reasonable TikZ sketches with high precision (~97% accuracy) in following text instructions- Developing a training process to align text, images and polygon sketches to allow finetuning on sketches from GPT-4- Demonstrating significantly improved performance on spatial relationship benchmarks by incorporating programmatic sketches, with near 2x gain over baseline diffusion modelsSo in summary, the core research question is how to effectively leverage the coding/programming strengths of LLMs like GPT-4 to improve the controllability of text-to-image generation through programmatic sketches. The paper aims to demonstrate this is viable and can enhance spatial/positional precision.
