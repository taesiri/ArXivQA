# [Controllable Text-to-Image Generation with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper aims to address is:How can large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 be leveraged to enhance the controllability and precision of text-to-image diffusion models? The paper introduces a framework called Control-GPT that integrates sketches generated by GPT-4 into the ControlNet architecture to guide text-to-image generation and improve models' ability to follow instructions. The central hypothesis is that incorporating programmatic sketches from GPT-4 as additional references alongside text prompts can help diffusion models better understand spatial relationships and generate images that align more closely with textual descriptions, especially for spatial and positional details.The key research contributions seem to be:- Proposing and evaluating a framework to integrate sketch generation abilities of LLMs like GPT-4 to guide and enhance controllability of diffusion models - Showing GPT-4 can generate reasonable TikZ sketches with high precision (~97% accuracy) in following text instructions- Developing a training process to align text, images and polygon sketches to allow finetuning on sketches from GPT-4- Demonstrating significantly improved performance on spatial relationship benchmarks by incorporating programmatic sketches, with near 2x gain over baseline diffusion modelsSo in summary, the core research question is how to effectively leverage the coding/programming strengths of LLMs like GPT-4 to improve the controllability of text-to-image generation through programmatic sketches. The paper aims to demonstrate this is viable and can enhance spatial/positional precision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be:The authors propose a framework called Control-GPT that integrates large language models (LLMs) with diffusion models for controllable text-to-image generation. Specifically, they use GPT-4 to generate programmatic sketches in the form of TikZ code based on text prompts. These sketches serve as additional guidance alongside the text for a diffusion model like Stable Diffusion to generate more precise and controllable images. To make this work, they construct a dataset of images, captions, and polygon sketches converted from instance masks to train the diffusion model to understand the programmatic sketches from GPT-4. They also incorporate grounding tokens to associate sketches with object names and positions for disambiguation. Experiments show their framework can significantly enhance the controllability of diffusion models in following spatial relationships, object positions/sizes specified in text compared to standard models. It also handles out-of-distribution prompts well.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the potential of integrating large language models with diffusion models through programmatic sketches to achieve more controllable text-to-image generation. This opens up new possibilities for improving controllability in image synthesis using capacities of LLMs.
