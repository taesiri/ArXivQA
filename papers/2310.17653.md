# [Fantastic Gains and Where to Find Them: On the Existence and Prospect of   General Knowledge Transfer between Any Pretrained Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17653)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors discover that arbitrary pairs of models pretrained on the same dataset encode complementary knowledge - unique information extracted from the data that the other model does not capture. Leveraging large model zoos, they find this complementary knowledge to exist between models irrespective of architectures, sizes, or relative performances. The authors then explore, through extensive experiments, if general-purpose knowledge transfer between arbitrary pretrained models is possible without relying on external rankings or suffering performance drops. Standard knowledge distillation often fails for this challenging task. Treating it as a continual learning problem, the authors propose confidence-based data partitioning to regularize the transfer objective. This allows knowledge gain from a teacher's area of expertise while retaining prior student knowledge. Without pairing-specific tuning, their method successfully transfers complementary knowledge, with over 90% non-zero student improvement across teacher-student pairs. Detailed studies provide insights on architectural properties beneficial for transfer, and the authors showcase gains from both single teacher transfer and continual multi-teacher transfer. Overall, this work motivates the development of general tools to unlock gains from arbitrary model repositories.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the existence of complementary knowledge between arbitrary pairs of models pretrained on the same dataset, even if their architectures or performances differ. The authors discover significant complementary knowledge in all model pairs tested. Motivated by this finding, the paper explores methods to transfer this complementary knowledge from one model to another without performance degradation, with the goal of improving any pretrained model using knowledge from freely available model zoos. The authors show that standard knowledge distillation struggles for this task, frequently degrading performance. They propose improvements using insights from continual learning, specifically confidence-based data partitioning during distillation. This method enables successful knowledge transfer between nearly all model pairs, consistently improving performance even when transferring from weaker teachers. Additional studies analyze how model properties impact transferability and demonstrate gains from multi-model transfer. Overall, the work provides strong evidence that complementary knowledge transfer between arbitrary pretrained models is viable using the right techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper explores the existence of complementary knowledge between arbitrary pretrained models and proposes methods to transfer this knowledge between models without performance degradation, treating it as a continual learning problem.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether it is possible to reliably transfer complementary knowledge from any pretrained teacher model to any pretrained student model without degrading the student's performance. 

The key hypotheses are:

- Arbitrary pairs of models pretrained on the same dataset exhibit complementary knowledge - information that one model holds about the data that the other lacks. This is true regardless of model architecture, size, or external performance.

- It should be possible to transfer this complementary knowledge from the teacher to the student in a general way that works for any model pairing, without relying on external performance metrics or hyperparameter tuning. 

- Standard knowledge distillation techniques are not sufficient for this task, but methods based on continual learning and confidence-based data partitioning can enable successful transfer between arbitrary model pairings.

- Architectural properties like model capacity and visual inductive biases impact the ability of a model to receive transferred knowledge. Larger models tend to be more receptive.

- Knowledge can be combined from multiple teacher models to further improve student performance, with sequential transfer performing favorably.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that general complementary knowledge transfer between any pretrained models is possible, which this paper explores through large-scale experiments and proposes methods to achieve.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Discovering the consistent existence of complementary knowledge between arbitrary models pretrained on the same dataset, even if model families or performances differ. 

2. Conducting extensive, exploratory studies to investigate the possibility of guaranteed model- and performance-independent transfer of the complementary knowledge without performance degradation.

3. Proposing a successful transfer method motivated through the lens of continual learning, leveraging a confidence-based, hyperparameter-free data partitioning approach.

4. Providing studies on the relation of general model properties to general knowledge transfer success.

5. Investigating knowledge transfer between multiple models.

In summary, the paper explores the existence of complementary knowledge in arbitrary pretrained models, and investigates methods to transfer this knowledge between models in a general, model-agnostic way without hurting performance. The proposed data partitioning method based on continual learning is shown to enable successful knowledge transfer between a wide variety of model pairings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions to the field of knowledge transfer between pretrained neural network models:

- It provides empirical evidence for the existence of complementary knowledge between arbitrary pairs of models trained on the same dataset, even if they differ in architecture, size, or performance. This motivates the exploration of general-purpose knowledge transfer methods.

- It conducts an extensive evaluation of standard knowledge distillation techniques for transferring complementary knowledge between pretrained models. The results reveal the limitations of these approaches, especially when transferring from weaker teacher models. 

- It proposes a novel knowledge transfer method based on continual learning principles and confidence-based data partitioning. This approach is shown to enable robust knowledge transfer between arbitrary model pairs without performance degradation.

- It studies the impact of model properties like capacity and inductive bias on the ability to transfer and receive knowledge. Larger capacities and reduced biases are found to be beneficial.

- It explores multi-teacher knowledge transfer, finding that a sequential transfer approach can outperform transfer from the single best teacher.

Overall, this work provides new insights into the existence and properties of complementary knowledge in pretrained models. The proposed knowledge transfer methodology enables tapping into this complementary knowledge between arbitrary models in a model-agnostic way. This sets it apart from prior work that focused on specific model pairs or required external performance measures. The paper opens up many avenues for future work on general-purpose knowledge transfer.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Further improving the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed transfer mechanism to unlock its full potential. The current gains are promising but still fall short of the estimated amount of complementary knowledge between models. Better trade-offs between retention and transfer may allow tapping more into this complementary knowledge.

- Exploring other methods for general knowledge transfer beyond distillation techniques, such as data-free approaches. The authors mention this as an alternative class of methods.

- Studying how architectural properties and training protocols impact the ability of models to receive and integrate complementary knowledge. The authors provide some initial analysis but more in-depth studies could further guide model design and pretraining for better knowledge transfer.

- Scaling up the multi-teacher transfer approach and studying how complementary knowledge from many teachers can be combined effectively. The authors show promising results on simple sequential transfer but more advanced ensemble and fusion techniques may be beneficial.

- Applying the proposed transfer approaches to other domains beyond image classification, such as natural language processing, to assess their general applicability.

- Exploring privacy-preserving and secure knowledge transfer techniques, for example based on federated learning, to enable transfer between proprietary models without exposing them.

- Studying the interplay between knowledge transfer and continual learning in more depth to develop techniques benefiting both areas.

In summary, the main future directions are improving transfer efficiency, studying architectural properties, scaling up multi-teacher transfer, applying it to new domains, enabling privacy-preserving transfer, and synergies with continual learning.
