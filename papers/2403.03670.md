# [CDC: A Simple Framework for Complex Data Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03670)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Clustering is an important unsupervised learning technique to extract knowledge from unlabeled data by grouping similar data points. 
- Existing clustering methods handle specific data types and challenges like multi-view, non-Euclidean, large-scale data etc independently. There lacks a unified clustering framework that works well across multiple complex data types while being scalable.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Complex Data Clustering (CDC) framework that can efficiently cluster different types of complex data like single-view, multi-view, graph, non-graph, small-scale and large-scale.
- First, graph filtering is used to fuse node attributes and topology information to get clustering-friendly representations. 
- Then, an anchor graph learning approach with a novel similarity-preserving regularizer is proposed to reduce complexity. The regularizer enables automatic learning of high-quality anchors instead of random selection.
- Optimization steps are provided to solve the objective functions. The overall method has linear time and space complexity.

Main Contributions:
- A simple yet unified clustering framework CDC that works for diverse complex data types with theoretical analysis of its properties.
- Novel application of graph filtering to obtain representations encoding topology and attributes.
- New similarity-preserving regularizer to automatically learn high-quality anchors instead of random selection.
- Impressive performance on 14 datasets especially large graphs with 100M nodes, demonstrating effectiveness and scalability.
- Thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods proving CDC's superiority across metrics like Accuracy, NMI etc.

In summary, the paper provides a simple, unified and linear complexity framework for clustering multiple types of complex data, with solid theoretical analysis and extensive experiments validating its advantages. The simplicity, generalizability and scalability make CDC an impactful advancement.
