# [When does dough become a bagel? Analyzing the remaining mistakes on   ImageNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04596)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 From my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. How well do state-of-the-art image classification models truly perform on ImageNet when evaluated with multi-label accuracy and accounting for potential label errors? 

2. What types of mistakes do these models still make when evaluated carefully on a multi-label subset of ImageNet?

3. Can manual expert review of all the remaining mistakes provide insights into the severity and nature of errors made by top models on ImageNet?

4. Can expert review be used to create a small, "major mistake" slice of ImageNet that could serve as a supplemental benchmark for future progress?

The authors seem interested in rigorously evaluating top models on ImageNet using multi-label accuracy, discovering what errors remain for state-of-the-art models, categorizing these errors through expert review, and assessing whether ImageNet can continue to serve as a useful benchmark or needs additional curation. The creation of the ImageNet-M subset aims to provide a new supplemental benchmark focused specifically on major mistakes. Overall, the key goal appears to be gaining new insights into ImageNet progress by exhaustively analyzing remaining errors made by top models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors manually review and categorize every remaining mistake made by top ImageNet models like ViT-3B and Greedy Soups. This allows them to get insights into the long-tail of errors for these state-of-the-art models. 

2. They find that nearly 50% of the apparent mistakes made by these models are actually not mistakes when reviewed by experts. This suggests that without careful review, we are significantly underestimating the performance of these models.

3. The authors categorize the remaining real mistakes into types like fine-grained errors, spurious correlations, etc. This provides insights into what kinds of mistakes today's top models are still making.

4. They introduce "ImageNet-M", a small subset of major mistakes that models should aim to get perfect on, as a potential additional evaluation benchmark.

5. The analysis also uncovers issues like validation set leakage in the ImageNet training set and provides recommendations for improving ImageNet evaluation going forward.

In summary, the key contribution is a careful expert review and analysis of the remaining errors made by top ImageNet models, providing insights into their mistakes and benchmarks to drive further progress. The paper also highlights issues with the dataset itself and makes recommendations for improving evaluation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to related work on analyzing errors in ImageNet classification:

1. Scope and focus: This paper provides a comprehensive, expert analysis and categorization of every remaining mistake made by two high-performing ImageNet models. Many prior works have analyzed subsets of errors or focused on specific issues like label noise. The exhaustive review of all mistakes for top models is novel.

2. Multi-label evaluation: The paper utilizes the multi-label ImageNet dataset and scoring to more fairly evaluate models. Prior works have advocated for multi-label evaluation, but this paper provides an in-depth analysis under this metric. 

3. Severity and type analysis: The authors introduce a taxonomy for categorizing mistakes by severity and type. They evaluate all mistakes on these dimensions to gain insight into the remaining error modes. Other papers have categorized errors but not with this level of granularity.

4. Recommendations: Concrete recommendations are made for improving ImageNet evaluation based on insights from mistake analysis, like introducing the ImageNet-M benchmark. Many papers observe issues but this one translates findings into actions.

5. Limitations acknowledgement: The paper transparently acknowledges limitations like biases in the qualitative judgments made during analysis. Few other error analyses reflect deeply on the potential flaws in methodology.

Overall, the exhaustive nature of the mistake review and the insights it provides into error modes and evaluation recommendations distinguish this paper from related works. The severity and type analysis also provides a more nuanced perspective compared to some prior research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing better multi-label benchmark datasets for image classification that have more comprehensive/accurate labels and allow for easier updating of labels over time as models make new valid predictions. They suggest dataset creators structure the evaluation process to make re-labeling and re-evaluating past models on updated labels more feasible.

- Continuing to analyze model mistakes through expert review, categorization, and severity assessment as models improve, to better understand the types of errors that remain and guide progress.

- Designing models that are better at representing uncertainty and avoiding obvious mistakes on out-of-distribution examples.

- Exploring techniques to increase the diversity of mistakes made by models trained in different ways, in order to build more accurate model ensembles.

- Investigating methods to reduce reliance on spurious correlations and better leverage context holistically.

- Studying the impact of noisy and duplicate training data on model mistakes and considering approaches to improve training data quality.

- Developing better automated methods for categorizing model errors and detecting label/data errors.

- Creating evaluation benchmarks focused specifically on major, unambiguous errors where current models still struggle.

In summary, they highlight directions like improving datasets/evaluations, analyzing mistakes, representing uncertainty, avoiding spurious correlations, enhancing training data, automating analysis, and creating targeted benchmarks as areas for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the remaining mistakes made by state-of-the-art image classification models on the ImageNet dataset. The authors manually review and categorize all the mistakes made by a ViT model with 3 billion parameters and a Greedy Soups model on the ImageNet multi-label validation set. They find that around 44% of the ViT model's mistakes and 47% of the Greedy Soups model's mistakes on this dataset were actually correct predictions that were missing from the original label set. After recategorizing the mistakes, the models achieved much higher multi-label accuracy. The remaining mistakes were categorized as fine-grained errors, fine-grained errors with out-of-vocabulary objects, spurious correlations, or non-prototypical examples. Around 40% were considered major mistakes that were clearly wrong. The models matched or exceeded human performance on a subset of images, but still made obvious mistakes on many images. The authors propose ImageNet-M, a subset of 68 major mistake images for benchmarking future progress. Overall, the analysis shows that top models are underestimated by the original ImageNet labels, but still have room for improvement on unambiguous mistakes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper analyzes the remaining mistakes made by state-of-the-art image classification models on the ImageNet dataset. The authors focus on the multi-label subset of ImageNet, where models now achieve over 97% accuracy. They manually review every mistake made by two models - a ViT model and the Greedy Soups model - on this subset. They find that around half of the supposed mistakes were actually reasonable predictions by the models, demonstrating that top models are significantly underestimated due to the single-label nature of the original ImageNet annotations. The authors categorize the true remaining mistakes and find that the majority are fine-grained or out-of-vocabulary errors. However, around 40% are major mistakes that humans would clearly identify as wrong, indicating there is still room for progress. Based on this analysis, the authors propose ImageNet-M, a small subset of 68 obvious mistakes for benchmarking future progress. They show current top models still struggle on ImageNet-M, only achieving 25-42% accuracy compared to 68/68 for humans. Overall, this paper provides a detailed categorization of the remaining errors made by top ImageNet models and highlights issues with the common evaluation metrics, proposing ImageNet-M as a more robust benchmark going forward.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) manual review and categorization of all remaining model mistakes on ImageNet multi-label reveals issues in common evaluation metrics; 2) around half of supposed mistakes are reasonable predictions, showing models are underestimated; 3) new proposed benchmark ImageNet-M focuses on obvious mistakes models still struggle with. The paper provides useful insights into what errors top models still make and highlights challenges in benchmarking progress.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the method used in the paper:

The paper analyzes the remaining mistakes made by state-of-the-art ImageNet models on the ImageNet multi-label validation set. To do this, they first evaluate a ViT-3B model on the multi-label set and identify 676 mistakes. They form an expert panel to manually review each of these mistakes in detail. For each mistake image, the panel determines whether the model's prediction is actually correct or if the ground truth label is problematic. If the model made an actual mistake, the panel categorizes the type of mistake (fine-grained, spurious correlation, etc.) and severity. After re-reviewing all mistakes, the authors find nearly half were not actual mistakes due to missing multi-labels or problematic original labels. For the remaining mistakes, most are fine-grained confusions and around 40% are major mistakes that humans would not make. The authors use this analysis to provide updated recommendations for ImageNet evaluation, including a new ImageNet-M subset for benchmarking major mistakes.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is analyzing the remaining mistakes that state-of-the-art image classification models make on the ImageNet dataset. Specifically, it is looking at the multi-label subset of ImageNet, where images can have more than one correct label. 

The key questions and goals of the paper are:

- What types of mistakes do current top models still make on ImageNet, even though their top-1 accuracy is 90%+? 

- Are all the supposed "mistakes" labeled correctly, or are some actually reasonable predictions that should count as correct under multi-label evaluation?

- Can the mistakes be categorized in a meaningful way (e.g. fine-grained confusion, spurious correlation, etc)? 

- What severity are the mistakes - are they obvious errors or more subtle?

- How do the best models compare to human performance on this multi-label subset?

- Can analysis of the mistakes provide insights into remaining challenges and lead to better evaluation sets for measuring future progress?

Overall, the paper is trying to do an in-depth categorization and review of the long-tail errors made by top models to better understand what progress is still needed and how models should be evaluated as they continue to improve.
