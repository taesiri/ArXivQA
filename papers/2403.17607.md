# [Fully-fused Multi-Layer Perceptrons on Intel Data Center GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17607)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are important building blocks for many AI applications, but narrow MLPs (small width, many layers) suffer from low performance due to limited arithmetic intensity. 
- Existing implementations do not fully optimize MLP performance, especially for inference.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present a SYCL implementation of fully-fused MLPs optimized for the Intel Data Center GPU Max 1550. 
- Their approach fuses operations within layers to maximize data reuse in registers and shared memory, minimizing slow accesses to global memory. This increases arithmetic intensity.
- A roofline model analysis shows their approach can improve theoretical peak performance for inference by up to 2x compared to a CUDA fused implementation.

Key Contributions:
1) First open-sourced SYCL implementation of fully-fused MLPs applied to Intel GPUs using the XMX instruction set.
2) Roofline analysis showing improved arithmetic intensity over CUDA implementation, reducing impact of memory bandwidth limitations.  
3) Benchmark and 3 application case studies (image compression, NeRFs, PINNs) demonstrating 1.75-2.84x speedup over CUDA implementation and up to 30x over PyTorch.

In summary, the paper presents an optimized SYCL-based implementation of MLPs for Intel GPUs. By fusing operations, data reuse is maximized leading to higher arithmetic intensity and performance improvements, especially for inference. Case studies demonstrate significant practical speedups across different applications. The implementation is open-sourced to enable wider adoption.
