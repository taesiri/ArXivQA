# Towards Efficient Dialogue Pre-training with Transferable and   Interpretable Latent Structure

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we build an open-domain dialogue system that is easily transferable from general domain pre-training to downstream tasks in a lightweight and transparent manner?The key points are:- Most existing dialogue pre-training methods rely on exhaustive training of massive models with hundreds of millions of parameters on huge datasets. This leads to inefficient running and poor interpretability. - This paper proposes a novel pre-trained dialogue model with a latent structure that makes it easily transferable and interpretable. - The latent structure consists of discrete conversation flow variables and disentangled context-sensitive/context-independent latent variables.- Self-supervised objectives are used to induce desirable properties in the latent variables like capturing time-invariant/dynamic factors. - This allows transferring intrinsic dialogue flow knowledge across domains in a lightweight and transparent way.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that incorporating a tailored latent structure with self-supervised disentanglement during pre-training will enable efficient and interpretable transfer of dialogue models to downstream tasks. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel dialogue model with a latent structure that is easily transferable from a general domain corpus to downstream tasks. The latent structure consists of discrete conversation flow variables and disentangled context-sensitive and context-independent latent variables. 2. It introduces self-supervised objectives during training to endow the latent variables with desired properties. Specifically, the context-sensitive variable captures holistic dialogue information while the context-independent variable reflects dynamic utterance-level information. This makes the model lightweight and the knowledge more transferable.3. It achieves superior performance over strong baselines on two dialogue benchmarks in both zero-resource and full-resource settings. The model uses much fewer parameters but yields better responses in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation. 4. It demonstrates improved decoding speed compared to baselines. The discrete conversation flow variables learn general transition patterns from the corpus to compensate for the small parameter size.5. The discrete conversation flow provides interpretability by visualizing the latent states. Human experts can interpret the meaning of each latent state.In summary, the key innovation is proposing a disentangled latent structure to incorporate contextual knowledge into pre-trained models, which results in an efficient dialogue model that generates high-quality and interpretable responses. The self-supervision and model design enable strong transferability to downstream tasks.
