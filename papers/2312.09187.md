# [Vision-Language Models as a Source of Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09187)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates using vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP to automatically generate reward functions for training reinforcement learning agents, without the need for environment-specific finetuning. The authors propose extracting a sparse binary reward signal indicating goal achievement from the cosine similarity between CLIP's embeddings of the current observation and desired goal description. They demonstrate this approach in procedural environments like Playhouse for object manipulation goals, and on Android emulator for app launching goals. The authors find that optimizing the VLM rewards leads to increased ground-truth returns, and show a scaling trend where larger VLMs (e.g. 1.4B parameter models) produce more accurate rewards and higher-performing policies, likely due to more robust visiolinguistic understanding. Additionally, they highlight the importance of prompt engineering for extracting better quality rewards from VLMs. Overall, this work makes a compelling case for utilizing modern VLMs in an off-the-shelf manner to produce capable goal-conditioned RL agents without environment-specific tuning, paving the way for more generalized reinforcement learning.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) has succeeded when clear reward functions are available, but defining rewards to achieve diverse goals in rich environments remains challenging.
- Scaling RL to generalist agents that can accomplish many goals has been limited by the difficulty of manually specifying reward functions for many goals.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP to automatically generate reward functions for visual goal achievement. 
- Derive a sparse binary reward from CLIP by thresholding the probability that an observation matches a language goal, computed using cosine similarity between embedded observation and goal descriptions.

Key Contributions:
- Show that maximizing the intrinsically defined VLM rewards leads to maximizing ground truth rewards on held-out goals.
- Demonstrate the approach succeeds across multiple visual domains (Playhouse, AndroidEnv) and goal types (find object, lift object, open app).
- Analyze scaling properties and show larger VLMs produce more accurate rewards and higher performing RL agents.  
- Show impact of prompt engineering and how more descriptive prompts improve resulting agents.

The paper makes a compelling case that off-the-shelf VLMs can provide accurate rewards to train RL agents for visual achievement of language goals, without need for task-specific finetuning. This helps address the challenge of scaling RL to generalist agents by removing the burden of manually specifying many reward functions.
