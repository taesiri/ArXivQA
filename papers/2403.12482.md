# [Embodied LLM Agents Learn to Cooperate in Organized Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Integrating large language models (LLMs) as agents into multi-agent systems for seamless cooperation is challenging. LLMs tend to over-report information and comply with any instructions, leading to redundancy and confusion when multiple LLM agents interact. Structured communication protocols are needed.  

Methods:
1) Proposed a multi-LLM architecture to enable embodied LLM agents to communicate and collaborate in simulated environments. Allows flexible inter-agent interactions and team organization structures via prompts.

2) Studied impact of hierarchical organization with designated leader vs disorganized teams. Leader provides coordination and improves efficiency. 

3) Developed a "Criticize-Reflect" LLM architecture for optimizing team structure prompts iteratively. Critic LLM evaluates team performance and Reflecting LLM proposes improved prompts. Enables emergent novel efficient structures.

Key Findings: 
1) Teams with designated leader reduce completion time by ~10\% with similar communication costs versus disorganized teams. Humans make best leaders.

2) Different LLM models exhibit varying leadership capabilities. Allowing constructive feedback to leader can help for some LLMs.

3) The Criticize-Reflect method allows LLMs to propose novel team structures (e.g. chain, dual-leader, dynamic) that improve efficiency by ~5-15\%.

Main Contributions:
1) Multi-LLM architecture to study configurable agent team structures and communications.

2) Empirical evaluation of organizational impact on LLM agent cooperation.

3) Automated optimization of team structures via learned critics and reflectors.

The key idea is to structure LLM agent interactions for efficient cooperation, with data-driven prompt optimization to discover novel beneficial team configurations. Findings could inform future multi-LLM-agent systems across applications.
