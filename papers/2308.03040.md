## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is: 

How can we design an effective prompting strategy to unlock compositional generalization capabilities in large language models?

Specifically, the key research questions appear to be:

- How can we teach large language models to compose basic skills in innovative ways to solve more complex reasoning problems beyond the examples they have seen before (i.e. compositional generalization or "easy-to-hard" generalization)?

- How can we develop a prompting approach that allows LLMs to explicitly ground each reasoning step on more elementary skills? 

- Can an effective prompting strategy initiate strong synergies between basic skills and composition capabilities in LLMs, enabling them to generalize systematically to solve harder, unseen problems?

- Can prompting allow LLMs to leverage both skills provided explicitly in the prompts as well as their internal pre-trained skills and knowledge?

The central hypothesis seems to be that by developing a prompting strategy called "Skills-in-Context" (SKiC) that provides basic skills, examples of skill composition, and the problem to be solved all within the same context, the LLM can learn to effectively ground its reasoning steps on skills it has already mastered. This should unlock latent compositional generalization capabilities, allowing the LLM to solve more complex problems by flexibly composing skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel prompting strategy called "Skills-in-Context" (SKiC) prompting to unlock compositional generalization abilities in large language models (LLMs). 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- SKiC prompting teaches LLMs to explicitly ground each reasoning step on more basic skills when solving complex problems. It does this by providing two main components in the prompt: (1) the skills needed, with descriptions and examples, and (2) examples showing how to compose the skills to solve more complex problems.

- SKiC prompting is a simple one-stage approach, unlike prior methods requiring multiple stages or model calls. It can easily replace other one-stage prompting strategies.

- Experiments across a diverse set of tasks (symbolic manipulation, arithmetic, QA, etc) show SKiC prompting achieves significantly improved generalization, especially on harder out-of-distribution problems. It even achieves near perfect accuracy on some tasks.

- SKiC prompting allows LLMs to go beyond just using the skills provided in the prompt, and leverage their internal skills learned during pretraining. This enables solving problems requiring innovative skill compositions.

- The method achieves new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks requiring compositional reasoning, such as GSM8K and MATH dataset for mathematical reasoning.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a simple yet effective prompting strategy to unlock and improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models, by teaching them to ground their reasoning on basic skills and compose them to solve more complex problems.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in compositional generalization for large language models:

- The key idea of using "skills-in-context" prompting to teach models to compose known skills to solve new problems is novel. Other recent work like chain-of-thought prompting and least-to-most prompting aim to improve compositional reasoning, but take different approaches.

- A major contribution of this work is showing that models can learn to leverage both skills provided explicitly in the prompt as well as skills acquired during pre-training. This ability to tap into a vast reservoir of internal knowledge is important for complex reasoning.

- The experiments are extensive, evaluating on a diverse set of compositional generalization tasks. The SKiC prompting strategy achieves state-of-the-art results across symbolic manipulation, arithmetic, QA, and math reasoning datasets.

- The gains over prior methods are substantial in many cases. For example, on longer last-letter concatenation problems, SKiC outperforms prior prompting techniques by over 16% on certain models. This highlights the effectiveness of the approach.

- The error analysis provides useful insights into current limitations and future directions, like the need for higher quality skill illustrations and more comprehensive skill coverage.

- Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on an important open problem in NLP - how to unlock compositional generalization in large language models. The SKiC prompting strategy is simple but powerful. The systematic experiments demonstrate clear improvements over strong baselines. I think this is a very solid contribution to the field.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel and effective prompting-based technique for compositional reasoning, analyzed thoroughly across diverse tasks. The results conclusively demonstrate the strengths of this approach compared to prior work. The insights from this research should help drive future progress in compositional generalization capabilities for LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more effective prompting strategies to further improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models. The authors propose their Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting technique, but note there is room for improvement by providing higher quality basic skills, expanding the range of skills, adding more examples for complex tasks, and using better foundation models.

- Applying and evaluating the SKiC prompting approach on a broader range of compositional generalization benchmarks beyond the ones explored in the paper. 

- Exploring how to best distill and incorporate skills into the prompting context, including automatically generating skills via prompting the language models themselves.

- Understanding the synergies between in-context skills and the internal skills and knowledge already present within the language models' parameters from pretraining. Finding ways to better align and activate the internal skills.

- Developing methods to allow language models to go beyond the skills provided in the prompt context and leverage their vast internal knowledge reservoirs. Enabling more flexible skill compositions tailored to each complex reasoning problem.

- Combining the SKiC prompting technique with other methods like ensemble strategies to further improve performance on challenging reasoning tasks.

- Using the SKiC prompting strategy as a general framework that could potentially be extended to other modalities beyond just language.

- Analyzing the limitations of current models and prompting approaches to identify areas needing improvement, such as unseen skills, incorrect reasoning, copying errors, etc.

In summary, the key directions concentrate on improving prompting strategies for compositional generalization, broadening their applicability, better utilizing internal skills, and hybridizing with other methods to push towards more human-like flexible reasoning and generalization capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompting strategy called Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting to improve the compositional generalization abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to provide the model with the basic skills needed to solve a complex task, along with a few examples showing how to compose those skills to solve sample problems. The prompt consists of three main parts: (1) the characterization of basic skills, (2) examples demonstrating skill composition, and (3) the problem to solve. This approach teaches the model to ground its reasoning steps on basic skills, achieving strong compositional generalization capabilities. Experiments on symbolic manipulation, arithmetic, question answering, dynamic programming, and mathematical reasoning tasks show state-of-the-art results, with SKiC prompting enabling near-perfect generalization on unseen harder problems in some cases. Notably, it allows models to harness both provided in-context skills and internal skills gained during pretraining. The unified one-stage prompting strategy is simple yet effective for unlocking compositionality in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Skills-in-Context Prompting is a novel prompting strategy that aims to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compositional generalization refers to the ability to use existing skills to solve new, more complex problems. The key idea is to provide the LLM with examples that demonstrate both relevant skills and how to compose those skills to solve problems. 

Specifically, a Skills-in-Context prompt contains three main components: (1) descriptions and examples of basic skills needed for a task, (2) one or two examples showing how to compose those skills to solve a sample problem, and (3) a new problem for the LLM to solve using the provided skills and examples. Experiments across several challenging tasks like arithmetic, question answering, and mathematical reasoning show significant improvements in generalization ability over previous prompting techniques. A notable finding is that the approach allows LLMs to leverage both provided in-context skills and their own internal pretrained knowledge. Overall, Skills-in-Context prompting provides an effective way to unlock compositional generalization in LLMs by teaching explicit skill composition grounded in basic competencies.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Skills-in-Context Prompting: Unlocking Compositionality in Large Language Models":

The paper proposes a novel prompting strategy called Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting to improve the compositional generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to provide the model with the basic skills needed to solve a task, a few examples showing how to compose those skills to solve more complex problems, and finally the problem to be solved, all within the same prompt context. This teaches the model to ground each reasoning step on the provided skills and compositions. Specifically, the prompt consists of three main blocks - (i) the basic skills along with instructions and examples, (ii) one or two examplars demonstrating skill composition, and (iii) the problem statement. By presenting skills and their explicit composition together, SKiC prompting enables LLMs to learn effective skill utilization and achieve superior compositional generalization on a variety of tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is trying to address is how to elicit stronger compositional generalization capabilities in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it focuses on developing prompting strategies that can teach LLMs to better compose basic skills for solving complex problems they have not seen before.

Some key aspects:

- LLMs today still struggle with compositional generalization, i.e. using known skills in new combinations to solve harder unseen problems. This is an important capability for more human-like flexible reasoning.

- Prior prompting methods like chain-of-thought or least-to-most improve performance but degrade quickly on harder problems and are restricted to certain task types.

- The paper proposes a new prompting approach called "Skills-in-Context" (SKiC) that teaches models to explicitly ground each reasoning step on basic skills. 

- SKiC prompts contain the skills, examples of composing skills, and the problem in one context. This teaches the model to link skills and compositions.

- Experiments show SKiC prompting achieves significantly better generalization on diverse tasks like symbolic manipulation, arithmetic, QA, dynamic programming, and math reasoning.

- SKiC allows models to even tap into internal skills beyond those stated in the prompt, unlocking more of their latent capabilities.

So in summary, the key problem is getting LLMs to better acquire and flexibly compose skills for compositional generalization. The paper develops SKiC prompting to address this critical challenge.
