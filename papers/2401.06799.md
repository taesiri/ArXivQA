# [Make Prompts Adaptable: Bayesian Modeling for Vision-Language Prompt   Learning with Data-Dependent Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models are widely used as backbones for downstream tasks but utilized as frozen models without learning. 
- Prompt learning methods add a learnable context vector to the input of VLP models to improve their adaptation for downstream tasks. 
- However, in a few-shot learning scenario, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) training of prompts can overfit dominant image features, harming generalization, especially under distribution shift between training and test data.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a Bayesian framework for prompt learning to mitigate overfitting and enhance adaptability. 
- Model a data-dependent prior distribution conditioned on averaged image features to regularize prompts to capture diverse modes in image features on seen data.
- Extend modeling of prior to unseen test data to adapt prompts to distribution shifts.
- Approximate posterior distribution of prompts via Wasserstein Gradient Flow for flexibility to capture complex modes of image features.

Main Contributions:
- Enhancing flexibility of prompts: Wasserstein Gradient Flow enables context vectors to more flexibly infer complex image feature spaces.
- Enhancing adaptability of prompts: Data-dependent prior guides context vectors to capture multi-modes of seen image features and adapt to unseen features, improving performance on both without trade-off.
- Demonstrate statistically significant improvements in few-shot classification, domain generalization, and unseen class generalization over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the paper develops a Bayesian prompt learning framework with a data-dependent prior to mitigate overfitting issues in few-shot learning of VLP models. It enhances the flexibility and adaptability of prompts to capture complex image features without performance trade-offs between seen and unseen data. Experiments validate improved performance over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a Bayesian framework for learning adaptable vision-language prompt representations that can capture complex modes in image features and generalize to unseen test distributions, using particle-based posterior approximation and data-dependent priors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Enhancing Flexibility of Prompt: By approximating the prompt posterior with Wasserstein Gradient Flow, the context vectors can be more flexibly utilized to infer complex image feature spaces. 

2. Enhancing Adaptability of Prompt: By modeling a data-dependent prior based on image feature information, the text features capture multi-modes of seen image features and adapt to unseen image features. This leads to improved performance on both seen and unseen datasets without trading off between them.

In summary, the key contributions are improving the flexibility and adaptability of prompts for vision-language models through a Bayesian modeling approach with a data-dependent prior. This allows the prompts to better capture diversity in image features and generalize to unseen data.

The paper proposes an Adaptive Particle-based Prompt Learning (APP) method within a Bayesian framework to improve the adaptability and generalization of VLP models in few-shot learning scenarios. Key ideas include modeling the prompt posterior with Wasserstein Gradient Flow for flexibility, using a data-dependent prior based on image features for capturing multi-modes, and adapting the prompts to test data for handling distribution shifts. The method is evaluated on few-shot classification, domain generalization, and unseen class generalization tasks.

In summary, the key focus is on making vision-language prompt learning more robust and adaptive in few-shot regimes by taking a Bayesian approach. The main technical contributions are the posterior approximation method and image-conditioned prior.
