# [Multilingual Bias Detection and Mitigation for Indian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15181)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Wikipedia aims to provide neutral and unbiased information, but often lacks diverse perspectives leading to neutrality bias. This exposes millions of readers to potentially inaccurate information.
- Prior work on detecting and mitigating neutrality bias focuses only on English Wikipedia. No solutions exist for Indian languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper contributes two new multilingual datasets - mWikiBias and mWNC covering 8 languages - for bias detection and mitigation tasks.
- For bias detection, Transformer encoder models like mDeBERTa are fine-tuned to classify sentences as biased or neutral. 
- For bias mitigation, Transformer encoder-decoder models like mT5 are fine-tuned to convert biased sentences to neutral versions in a style transfer setup.

Key Contributions:
- First work to study neural multilingual bias detection and mitigation for Indian languages
- mWikiBias and mWNC datasets with ~568K and ~78K sentences spanning 8 languages
- mDeBERTa outperforms other models for bias detection with 65.14% F1 score
- mT5 and mT0 achieve best bias mitigation performance with 85.82 and 79.70 Harmonic Mean scores.

In summary, the paper introduces the task of multilingual bias detection and mitigation for Indian languages, provides datasets to study these problems, and demonstrates strong baseline results using Transformer models like mDeBERTa, mT5 and mT0.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two new multilingual datasets for bias detection and mitigation covering 8 languages, investigates the effectiveness of Transformer-based models on these tasks, and establishes strong initial baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the tasks of multilingual bias detection and mitigation for Indian languages, which have not been studied before. 

2. Contributing two new datasets - mWikiBias and mWNC - for multilingual natural language generation covering 8 languages (English + 7 Indian languages). The datasets contain around 568K and 78K samples respectively for bias detection and mitigation.

3. Presenting baseline results on the two tasks using standard Transformer-based models like mDeBERTa, InfoXLM, MuRIL, mT5, IndicBART and mT0. The results show that mDeBERTa performs the best for bias detection while mT5 and mT0 give the best bias mitigation performance.

4. Making the code and datasets publicly available to spur further research in this direction.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing the new multilingual bias detection and mitigation tasks for Indian languages, contributing benchmark datasets, and establishing initial baseline results using state-of-the-art models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this work are:

- Neutral Point of View (NPOV): Referring to Wikipedia's policy that content should represent all significant views fairly and without bias. This is the definition of bias that the paper follows.

- Bias detection and bias mitigation: The two main tasks that the paper focuses on - detecting sentences that violate NPOV guidelines and converting them into more neutral sentences. 

- Indian languages: The paper works on 7 Indian languages - Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada, in addition to English.

- Multilingual models: The paper experiments with various multilingual Transformer models like mDeBERTa, InfoXLM, MuRIL, IndicBART, mT5, mT0 for bias detection and mitigation.

- Datasets: The paper contributes two new datasets - mWikiBias and mWNC covering bias detection and mitigation for the 8 languages.

Some other terms include style transfer, neutrality bias, debiasing accuracy, zero-shot learning, natural language generation etc. related to the tasks and models used in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a multilingual bias detection and mitigation approach for Indian languages. What are some key challenges in extending bias detection and mitigation to Indian languages compared to English? 

2. The paper creates two new datasets - mWikiBias and mWNC. Describe the data curation process and filtering heuristics used to create cleaner versions of these datasets.

3. For the bias detection task, three Transformer encoder models are experimented with. Analyze the tradeoffs between macro precision and macro recall for these models in Table 2. Which model balances both metrics the best?

4. The bias mitigation task is formulated as a style transfer problem. Explain why simply maximizing n-gram overlap metrics with the ground truth sentences is not sufficient to evaluate mitigation performance.  

5. The paper proposes a metric called Normalized Accuracy (NAcc) to evaluate how well the generated sentences mitigate bias while retaining meaning. Explain this metric and discuss whether you think it effectively captures debiasing accuracy.

6. Analyze the detailed per-language bias mitigation results in Table 4. Which languages pose the biggest challenges? What could be some reasons behind the poor performance for those languages?

7. The human evaluation results reveal some languages are easier to debias than others. Speculate on possible reasons for why mWNC seems easier to debias than mWikiBias based on the dataset curation process.  

8. The conclusion mentions experimenting with reinforcement learning to use the detection model's scores to improve mitigation. Elaborate an approach to incorporate the detection scores in the reward formulation.

9. Discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and datasets used. What are other forms of societal biases that are not addressed that could be incorporated?

10. Suggest possible extension tasks that can build on top of the proposed multilingual bias detection and mitigation approach, such as controlled text generation based on bias attributes.
