# [Risk-Aware Continuous Control with Neural Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Risk-Aware Continuous Control with Neural Contextual Bandits":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of contextual bandits with constraints, where the goal is to maximize a reward metric while satisfying one or more constraint metrics at each time step. Importantly, the paper considers that the metrics have intrinsic random noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This uncertainty poses challenges for constraint satisfaction. The paper also considers continuous action spaces.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a risk-aware decision-making framework called RANCB that uses an actor multi-critic neural network architecture. It employs multiple critics, one for the reward and one per constraint, to characterize the distribution of each metric instead of just the mean. This allows modulating the risk level by using different quantiles of the distributions. The critics are trained with a quantile Huber loss. A deterministic actor is trained based on an aggregated reward signal that uses the critics to penalize constraint violations. The level of risk aversion is controlled by a parameter Î± that selects the quantile considered from the critics.

Main Contributions:
- Novel actor multi-critic architecture to learn the distributions of multiple metrics for risk-aware decision-making 
- Ability to modulate risk in continuous action spaces by selecting quantiles from learned distributions
- Evaluation in synthetic and real-world environments shows the approach effectively balances performance and constraint satisfaction
- Comparisons to baselines highlight benefits of distributional critics and multi-critic approach
- Addresses limitations of existing constrained contextual bandits and safe Bayesian optimization methods

In summary, the paper presents an innovative risk-aware reinforcement learning approach for constrained problems with stochastic metrics and continuous actions. It demonstrates superior reliability with a small cost in performance compared to existing methods.
