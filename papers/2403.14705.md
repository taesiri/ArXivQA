# [Concept-Best-Matching: Evaluating Compositionality in Emergent   Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Emergent communication (EC) refers to artificial agents learning to communicate to accomplish a task, resulting in opaque communication protocols. 
- Evaluating if such protocols exhibit desirable traits like compositionality is challenging. Prior methods provide only coarse, opaque scores rather than direct mapping between emergent words and natural language (NL) concepts.

Proposed Solution:
- The key insight is that compositionality requires mapping between EC words (message parts) and NL concepts (meanings).
- A bipartite graph is constructed between unique EC words and unique NL concepts (feature-value pairs).
- The best-match algorithm finds an optimal 1-to-1 assignment between words and concepts by maximizing the sum of edge weights.
- The match quality directly evaluates compositionality. A perfect match means every EC word maps to a unique NL concept.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new evaluation method "Concept Best Matching" to directly quantify compositionality in EC by mapping words to concepts.
- Provides both a global compositionality score and an interpretable translation map between emergent vocabulary and natural language meanings.
- Identifies different issues like ambiguities, paraphrases and unmatched concepts that affect compositionality.
- Experiments on two EC tasks show the approach provides more insights compared to opaque scores from prior methods like Topographic Similarity and Adjusted Mutual Information.
- Finds that current state-of-the-art EC methods do not achieve fully satisfactory compositionality akin to natural language.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution in EC evaluation by proposing an interpretable approach to directly characterize and quantify the compositionality of emergent protocols. The translation mapping and granular scores provide useful insights unavailable from prior opaque metrics.
