# [SPDE priors for uncertainty quantification of end-to-end neural data   assimilation schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01855)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Geophysical spatio-temporal dataset interpolation is challenging due to large data sizes and complex physics. Traditional methods like Optimal Interpolation (OI) have limitations. Recent deep learning methods for data assimilation show promise but lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) to model complex spacetime priors with non-stationary covariances. 

- This SPDE prior is embedded in an end-to-end neural variational scheme with an augmented state containing the SPDE parameters. 

- The scheme jointly optimizes the reconstruction loss and likelihood of SPDE parameters given true states. This enables parameter inference and uncertainty quantification.

- Sampling the stochastic SPDE prior and conditioning with the neural solver provides a way to estimate the posterior distribution with ensemble members.

Key Contributions:

- Derivation of analytical SPDE-based spacetime precision matrices based on finite-difference discretization, enabling large data assimilation

- Formulation of a neural variational scheme with SPDE prior and augmented state containing evolveable parameters 

- A joint optimization scheme for state reconstruction and likelihood-based SPDE parameter estimation

- A framework for uncertainty quantification through sampling of the SPDE prior and neural conditioning

- Demonstration of SPDE-based reconstruction and parameter inference on Gaussian processes and realistic nonlinear sea surface height data

The key novelty is the integration of SPDE modeling with deep learning for an interpretable and stochastic neural assimilation scheme with uncertainty estimation capabilities.
