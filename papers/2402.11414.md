# [Fine-grained and Explainable Factuality Evaluation for Multimodal   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal summarization aims to generate concise summaries from text and images. However, existing methods suffer from generating unfactual or hallucinated content not grounded in the inputs. 

- Current metrics for evaluating factuality have limitations. BERTScore focuses on grammar not factuality. CLIPScore struggles with counting objects or compositional reasoning. CLIPBERTScore combines them but is coarse-grained and inexplainable.

- There is a need for fine-grained and explainable metrics that can evaluate factuality of multimodal summarization models.

Proposed Solution:
- Two evaluation frameworks called FALLACIOUS are introduced - one reference-based using ground truth summaries, and one reference-free without ground truth.

- Both generate factual questions about the summary based on atomic entities and relations. Answers are obtained from the text/image to check consistency. Aggregate scores measure fine-grained factuality.

- Reference-based: Generates questions from ground truth summary. Compares QA model answers between predicted and ground truth summaries.

- Reference-free: Generates questions from predicted summary. Checks if questions can be answered by document and image separately.

Contributions:
- Fine-grained and explainable frameworks to evaluate factuality of multimodal summarization models, for both reference-based and reference-free scenarios.

- In-depth analysis showing strong correlation to human ratings of factuality compared to existing metrics. Demonstrates effectiveness.

In summary, the paper tackles the key issue of evaluating factuality for multimodal summarization in an fine-grained and explainable manner. Both reference-based and reference-free frameworks outperform previous metrics.
