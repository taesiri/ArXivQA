# [High-quality Data-to-Text Generation for Severely Under-Resourced   Languages with Out-of-the-box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Performance of NLP methods for severely under-resourced languages lags far behind state-of-the-art methods for well-resourced languages like English. 
- Creating rule-based systems or collecting task-specific training data requires considerable manual effort and time.  
- Ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate quality text for under-resourced languages when used out-of-the-box with no task-specific tuning is untested.

Proposed Solution:
- Test LLMs on data-to-text generation for the under-resourced languages Irish, Welsh, Breton and Maltese and compare performance to English.
- Use LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot modes, generating directly into the target language or via English and machine translation.
- Test 4 LLMs - GPT-3.5, BLOOM, LLaMa2-chat, Falcon-chat across range of scenarios.

Main Contributions:
- LLMs easily set new state-of-the-art for the under-resourced languages, with huge margins over previous systems.  
- Human evaluation shows on-par performance with humans for best LLM systems in all languages tested.
- For English, LLM systems match or exceed state-of-the-art and human performance.  
- BLEU scores much lower for under-resourced languages versus English, but more correlation shown in other metrics and human judgement.
- Demonstrates great potential for LLMs to bridge performance gaps for under-resourced languages versus well-resourced ones like English.

In summary, the paper shows LLMs can achieve human-level text generation for under-resourced languages without task-specific tuning, dramatically improving state of the art and offering promise for real-world applications.
