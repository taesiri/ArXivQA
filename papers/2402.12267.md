# [High-quality Data-to-Text Generation for Severely Under-Resourced   Languages with Out-of-the-box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Performance of NLP methods for severely under-resourced languages lags far behind state-of-the-art methods for well-resourced languages like English. 
- Creating rule-based systems or collecting task-specific training data requires considerable manual effort and time.  
- Ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate quality text for under-resourced languages when used out-of-the-box with no task-specific tuning is untested.

Proposed Solution:
- Test LLMs on data-to-text generation for the under-resourced languages Irish, Welsh, Breton and Maltese and compare performance to English.
- Use LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot modes, generating directly into the target language or via English and machine translation.
- Test 4 LLMs - GPT-3.5, BLOOM, LLaMa2-chat, Falcon-chat across range of scenarios.

Main Contributions:
- LLMs easily set new state-of-the-art for the under-resourced languages, with huge margins over previous systems.  
- Human evaluation shows on-par performance with humans for best LLM systems in all languages tested.
- For English, LLM systems match or exceed state-of-the-art and human performance.  
- BLEU scores much lower for under-resourced languages versus English, but more correlation shown in other metrics and human judgement.
- Demonstrates great potential for LLMs to bridge performance gaps for under-resourced languages versus well-resourced ones like English.

In summary, the paper shows LLMs can achieve human-level text generation for under-resourced languages without task-specific tuning, dramatically improving state of the art and offering promise for real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

The paper demonstrates that large language models can achieve on-par-with-human performance for data-to-text generation even for severely under-resourced languages, substantially outperforming prior state-of-the-art systems and showing great promise for helping close the performance gap between resource-rich and resource-poor languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating the great potential of large language models (LLMs) to bridge the performance gap between severely under-resourced languages and well-resourced languages like English for the task of data-to-text generation. Specifically, the paper shows that out-of-the-box LLMs can easily set new state-of-the-art results for under-resourced languages like Irish, Welsh, Breton and Maltese on this task, achieving on-par-with-human performance according to human evaluations. The paper provides evidence that despite having seen little text in those languages during training, LLMs can generate high-quality texts without task-specific fine-tuning or data collection. Overall, it makes a compelling case for the ability of LLMs to greatly benefit under-resourced languages with minimal effort.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper explores the performance of pretrained LLMs for text generation in low-resource languages.

- Under-resourced languages: The paper focuses on four under-resourced European languages - Irish, Welsh, Breton, and Maltese. 

- Data-to-text generation: The paper examines LLMs for the task of data-to-text generation, specifically mapping input RDF triples to output texts.

- Zero-shot ability: A key aspect explored is the zero-shot ability of LLMs to generate quality texts without task-specific fine-tuning. 

- Prompt engineering: The paper also looks at using prompt engineering to optimize LLMs' performance.

- Automatic metrics: Automatic metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, etc. are used to evaluate the LLMs' output.

- Human evaluation: Human evaluations are conducted to assess fluency, omissions, additions in the generated texts.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for data-to-text generation in severely under-resourced languages. What are some challenges or limitations of using LLMs for low-resource languages compared to high-resource languages?

2. The paper tests four different LLMs - GPT-3.5, BLOOM, LLaMa2-chat, and Falcon-chat. What are some key differences between these models in terms of training data, fine-tuning techniques, and model architectures? How do these differences impact their performance?

3. The paper experiments with generating text directly in the target language vs. generating in English and then translating. What might be some pros and cons of each approach? When might one approach be preferred over the other?

4. The paper finds that few-shot prompting leads to better performance than zero-shot for most models. Why might additional context help in the few-shot case? What types of information does the additional context provide?

5. The results show performance gaps between languages, with the best scores obtained for Welsh. What factors might account for differences in performance across languages?

6. Human evaluation shows on-par performance with humans for the best systems, but BLEU scores are much lower for under-resourced languages compared to English. Why might this discrepancy occur? What limitations does it highlight of BLEU for this type of evaluation?

7. Could the method explored in this paper overcome some limitations of previous approaches like hand-crafted rule-based systems or supervised finetuning? What benefits might the LLM approach provide?

8. How suitable do you think this method would be for real-world applications needing text generation in low-resource languages? What other techniques could complement the approach to make it more practical?

9. The paper focuses specifically on data-to-text generation. Do you think LLMs could show promise on other NLP tasks for low-resource languages? Why or why not?

10. What future work could build upon the method and findings shared in this paper? What are 1-2 priority next steps for improving LLM-based generation for severely under-resourced languages?
