# [Learning to walk in confined spaces using 3D representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Legged robots have potential to traverse complex terrains and access confined spaces using their flexibility to select footholds and adapt body posture. However, robust real-world deployment in such spaces remains an open challenge. Prior methods are limited to simple environments or assume accurate mapping, which fails under real-world perception uncertainties.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper presents a two-layer hierarchical policy framework to enable robust locomotion control of legged robots for navigating confined spaces. 

1) The lower-level policy handles ground obstacles and follows 6D commands (x,y velocities, yaw rate, roll, pitch, body height) for posture adaptation capabilities. It is trained via RL on varied rough terrains.

2) The higher-level policy generates 6D commands using 3D spatial understanding to guide the lower policy. It is trained using procedural generation of confined spaces in simulation. 

3) For real-world applicability, the framework uses a teacher-student approach. The teacher uses accurate data, while the student uses noisy on-board sensors. Spatial data is encoded in occupancy voxels for sensor flexibility.

Main Contributions:

1) Hierarchical policy decomposition into a robust lower locomotion policy and a higher confinement-aware policy for posture adaptation.

2) Teacher-student training methodology and voxel representation to enable real-world deployment under perception uncertainties.

3) Procedural terrain generation for creating diverse confined space environments in simulation.

4) System demonstration on a quadruped robot traversing challenging confined spaces with loose gravel, uneven steps, and tilted overhead structures.
