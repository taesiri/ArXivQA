# [ActFormer: Scalable Collaborative Perception via Active Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing collaborative perception methods suffer from scalability issues when dealing with a large number of robots and sensors, due to their passive usage of all available sensor data.
- There is a lack of approaches that can actively and intelligently request only the most relevant information from collaborators based on spatial knowledge, without relying on the sensor data itself.

Proposed Solution: 
- ActFormer - A Transformer-based architecture for scalable collaborative perception that leverages deformable attention and predefined BEV queries.
- Key idea is to enable the ego agent to actively discern the relevance of collaborators' sensors based on their poses, without needing to transmit the sensor data. 
- An interest score is generated for each BEV query w.r.t. available cameras using their poses. High-score queries selectively aggregate information.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptualizes a scalable collaborative perception framework that can actively identify relevant measurements purely based on spatial knowledge.
- Concretizes concept into ActFormer which uses BEV queries to selectively attend to relevant cameras based solely on pose information. 
- Achieves superior detection performance and 50% query reduction compared to baseline on V2X-Sim dataset.
- Sets apart from prior works by using BEV queries to guide active collaboration as opposed to passive feature fusion.

In summary, ActFormer introduces an active selection mechanism based purely on spatial knowledge to achieve efficient and scalable collaborative 3D perception from images, without relying on communicated sensor data. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate its effectiveness.
