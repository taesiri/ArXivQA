# [Entire Chain Uplift Modeling with Context-Enhanced Learning for   Intelligent Marketing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In e-commerce, users follow a sequential behavior pattern (impression → click → conversion). Marketing strategies like coupons have different uplift effects on each stage. 
- Existing uplift models have two key issues:
  (1) Chain-bias: Only modeling one stage (e.g. conversion) fails to capture the full chain's uplift, leading to biased results.  
  (2) Treatment-unadaptive: Features have static representations, unable to capture behavioral changes under different treatments.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose the Entire Chain UPlift method with context-enhanced learning (ECUP). It has two key components:

1. Entire Chain-Enhanced Network (ECENet):
   - Models uplift score across entire chain space (impression → click → conversion).
   - Uses a Task-Enhanced Network to inject task information into representations, enhancing awareness of impact on each stage.
   - Addresses chain-bias issue.

2. Treatment-Enhanced Network (TENet):
   - Guides treatment-aware refinement of features. 
   - Uses bit-level weights for flexible adjustment of features under different treatments.
   - Addresses treatment-unadaptive issue.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies and proposes a solution to address the chain-bias problem in uplift modeling.
- Introduces a novel context-enhanced uplift modeling method ECUP to tackle chain-bias and treatment-unadaptive issues.
- Releases a large-scale coupon usage dataset from Meituan for uplift modeling research.
- Demonstrates ECUP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both offline and online experiments.
