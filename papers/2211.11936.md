# [One Eye is All You Need: Lightweight Ensembles for Gaze Estimation with   Single Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11936)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve gaze estimation performance using lightweight neural network architectures and ensemble methods while requiring only a single eye image as input?The key points related to this question are:- The paper investigates using small ResNet, Inception, and InceptionResNet architectures for gaze estimation, compared to standard CNNs used in prior work. The goal is to improve accuracy while keeping the model lightweight. - The paper proposes and tests gaze estimation using just a single eye image as input, rather than requiring both eyes or the full face. This makes the method more practical for real-world usage.- The paper proposes an ensemble approach to gaze calibration, combining predictions from multiple models to get improved subject-specific calibration. - Overall, the paper aims to push gaze estimation accuracy higher using these techniques while keeping compute and data requirements low by only needing a single eye image.
