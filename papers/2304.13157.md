# [Generative Relevance Feedback with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13157)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Can long-form text generated by large language models be used effectively for pseudo-relevance feedback in query expansion for document retrieval?

The key hypothesis appears to be that generating long-form text relevant to a query using a large language model, without relying on retrieved documents, can improve query expansion and retrieval effectiveness compared to traditional pseudo-relevance feedback approaches that use retrieved documents. 

The authors propose a new method called "Generative Relevance Feedback" (GRF) that generates various types of text related to a query (e.g. keywords, facts, documents, essays) using the GPT-3 model. This generated text is then used as input to create a relevance model for query expansion, instead of relying on potentially unreliable retrieved documents. 

The central hypothesis is that this approach will improve retrieval effectiveness, especially for difficult queries where the initial retrieval results may be poor. The authors evaluate GRF on several standard test collections and find that it outperforms strong baselines using traditional pseudo-relevance feedback, demonstrating the potential of using generative models like GPT-3 for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new query expansion method called Generative Relevance Feedback (GRF) that uses text generated by large language models rather than pseudo-relevance feedback from retrieved documents. The key points are:

- GRF generates diverse types of query-relevant text like keywords, entities, facts, documents, etc. using LLMs without relying on an initial retrieval pass. 

- Long-form text generation (news, documents, essays) is more effective for expansion than short text (keywords, entities). Text closer in style to the target corpus works best.

- Combining text across all generation types gives the best results, improving over the top standalone method. 

- GRF outperforms pseudo-relevance feedback methods like RM3 across several datasets. It achieves 5-19% higher MAP and 17-24% higher NDCG@10 compared to RM3.

- GRF achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness compared to recent sparse, dense, and learned sparse PRF methods. It has the best Recall@1000 on all datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a new generative approach to query expansion that leverages LLM text generation and does not rely on potentially noisy pseudo-relevant documents. The results demonstrate improved retrieval effectiveness over existing PRF techniques.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on query expansion and pseudo-relevance feedback:

- The main novelty is using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to generate long-form text for query expansion, rather than relying on pseudo-relevance feedback from retrieved documents. Most prior work uses retrieved documents, knowledge graphs, or embeddings for expansion.

- The proposed Generative Relevance Feedback (GRF) approach combines multiple types of text generation (keywords, entities, facts, documents, etc.) for robust expansion. Other work typically focuses on just one expansion source. 

- GRF does not require an initial retrieval, unlike pseudo-relevance feedback methods that rely on the quality of the first-pass results. This makes it potentially more robust.

- The authors demonstrate GRF works well on diverse datasets - newswire, web, and MS MARCO. Most prior work focuses evaluation on only 1 or 2 datasets.

- GRF achieves significant gains over strong pseudo-relevance feedback baselines like RM3 across metrics. Comparisons to multiple state-of-the-art sparse, dense, and learned sparse expansion methods demonstrate the strength of the approach.

- One limitation is the reliance on GPT-3, whereas much related work uses more reproducible methods and models. The prompts and text generations help mitigate this.

Overall, this paper presents a novel generative approach to query expansion using recent LLMs. The thorough experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of GRF across multiple test collections compared to a range of competitive expansion techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Study other methods for generating text from LLMs beyond the generation subtasks explored in this work, such as using different prompts, finetuning, or other techniques to optimize the generated text for relevance feedback.

- Explore using other types of LLMs beyond GPT-3, such as models optimized for knowledge intensive tasks, dialog, summary generation, etc.

- Analyze the generated text more deeply to understand what makes certain generation subtasks or models more effective for relevance feedback.

- Evaluate GRF on other information retrieval tasks beyond document ranking, such as passage retrieval, question answering, etc. 

- Compare GRF against other query expansion techniques like pseudorelevance feedback on additional datasets and domains.

- Study how to combine GRF with first-pass retrieval feedback to get the benefits of both approaches.

- Explore using GRF for clarifying ambiguous queries or query understanding.

- Extend GRF to do multi-stage relevance feedback, generating multiple rounds of text.

- Evaluate the efficiency, computational complexity, and scalability of GRF on large-scale systems.

Overall, the main future directions focus on expanding the techniques for text generation, applying GRF to new tasks and datasets, analyzing what makes it effective, and integrating it into full retrieval systems. The authors lay out a research agenda for continued exploration of generative relevance feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new query expansion technique called Generative Relevance Feedback (GRF) that uses text generated by large language models rather than retrieved documents for pseudo-relevance feedback. GRF generates diverse types of query-specific text like keywords, entities, facts, documents, news articles, etc. and shows that long-form text generation closer in style to the target dataset works best.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new query expansion technique called Generative Relevance Feedback (GRF) that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate query-specific text for expansion instead of relying on pseudo-relevant documents. GRF generates various types of text related to the query, including keywords, entities, reasoning chains, facts, documents, news articles, etc. It then builds a relevance model using the probabilities of terms in this generated text. Experiments on several TREC document retrieval datasets show GRF significantly outperforms pseudo-relevance feedback methods like RM3. Long-form text generation (documents, essays, news) works best, especially when it matches the style of the target corpus. Furthermore, combining text across all the generation tasks gives the best results, improving MAP 5-19% over RM3. Overall, GRF achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other query expansion techniques, showing the promise of using LLM-generated text for relevance feedback.

In more detail, the paper first outlines the GRF approach which uses an LLM like GPT-3 to generate diverse text related to the query. This text is generated in a zero-shot manner without any retrieved documents. GRF then builds a relevance model combining the original query with probabilistic terms from the generated text, similar to RM3. Experiments compare variants of GRF based on different generation tasks as well as comparing GRF against competitive baselines on TREC datasets. The results show long-form generation works best, especially when it matches the corpus style (e.g. news for newswire, documents for web docs). Combining all generation tasks gives the optimal results, improving over any single task. Against baselines, GRF substantially outperforms RM3 and other state-of-the-art pseudo-relevant feedback techniques. The paper demonstrates the potential for LLM-generated text to provide robust query expansion without reliance on initial retrieval.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Generative Relevance Feedback (GRF), a novel query expansion method that leverages text generated by large language models rather than relying on pseudo-relevance feedback. GRF prompts a large language model like GPT-3 to generate diverse types of long-form, query-specific text such as keywords, entities, facts, news articles, documents, and essays. This generated text is then used as input to proven query expansion models like the Relevance Model to expand the original query with relevant terms. By generating text independent of any initial retrieval, GRF avoids noise from non-relevant results in pseudo-relevance feedback. Experiments on several document retrieval benchmarks show GRF significantly outperforms strong baselines like RM3 expansion and achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of using large language models for generative query expansion.
