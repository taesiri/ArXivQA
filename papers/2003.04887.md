# [ReZero is All You Need: Fast Convergence at Large Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04887)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research hypothesis appears to be that applying a simple technique called ReZero to residual neural network architectures can improve signal propagation and enable training of very deep models. Specifically, the authors propose adding a single trainable parameter initialized to 0 that gates/scales the residual connection in residual network architectures like ResNets and Transformers. They hypothesize that this "ReZero" technique helps these network architectures maintain "dynamical isometry", which means signals and gradients can propagate through the very deep network without exploding or vanishing.The authors then conduct experiments on fully-connected networks, Transformers, and ResNets to test whether ReZero enables training much deeper versions of these architectures and also accelerates training convergence compared to prior techniques like skip connections, careful initialization schemes, and normalization methods.In summary, the central research question is whether their proposed simple ReZero technique can facilitate deep signal propagation and allow efficient training of very deep residual neural networks across diverse architecture types. The paper aims to test this hypothesis through empirical experiments demonstrating improved convergence speed and ability to train extremely deep models using ReZero.
