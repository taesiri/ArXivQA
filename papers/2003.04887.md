# [ReZero is All You Need: Fast Convergence at Large Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04887)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research hypothesis appears to be that applying a simple technique called ReZero to residual neural network architectures can improve signal propagation and enable training of very deep models. Specifically, the authors propose adding a single trainable parameter initialized to 0 that gates/scales the residual connection in residual network architectures like ResNets and Transformers. They hypothesize that this "ReZero" technique helps these network architectures maintain "dynamical isometry", which means signals and gradients can propagate through the very deep network without exploding or vanishing.The authors then conduct experiments on fully-connected networks, Transformers, and ResNets to test whether ReZero enables training much deeper versions of these architectures and also accelerates training convergence compared to prior techniques like skip connections, careful initialization schemes, and normalization methods.In summary, the central research question is whether their proposed simple ReZero technique can facilitate deep signal propagation and allow efficient training of very deep residual neural networks across diverse architecture types. The paper aims to test this hypothesis through empirical experiments demonstrating improved convergence speed and ability to train extremely deep models using ReZero.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a simple architecture change called ReZero that facilitates dynamical isometry and enables efficient training of very deep neural networks. - ReZero initializes each layer to perform the identity operation by adding a residual connection and a trainable parameter Î± initialized to 0 for each layer. This allows signals and gradients to flow freely through the network initially.- ReZero is shown to enable training of very deep fully-connected and convolutional neural networks. It allows training of ResNets with thousands of layers and Transformers with over 100 layers without extra techniques.- ReZero accelerates training convergence compared to standard architectures. When applied to Transformers, it converges 56% faster on language modeling. With ResNets, it provides 32% faster convergence on CIFAR-10 image classification.- Analysis shows ReZero networks stay close to dynamical isometry throughout training, with input-output Jacobian singular values concentrated near 1, enabling effective propagation.- ReZero is simple, modular, and broadly applicable across network architectures, requiring only a small change to achieve much improved deep training.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating the ReZero technique for enabling fast and effective training of very deep networks across different architectures. ReZero's simplicity and strong results show the importance of dynamical isometry for deep learning.
