# [Deep Painterly Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03189)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we seamlessly paste an object from a photo into a painting such that the composite still looks like a genuine painting in the style of the original?

The key challenges identified are:

- Existing photo compositing techniques like Poisson blending, histogram matching, etc. do not work well for paintings because they cannot handle the brushwork textures. 

- Applying global painterly stylization methods locally to the pasted region also produces poor results.

- Need an algorithm dedicated to local painterly harmonization that determines which statistics to transfer from the painting to the inserted object.

To address this, the paper introduces a two-pass algorithm:

1) First pass does a coarse harmonization to get the pasted object closer to the painting's style. 

2) Second pass refines the output for accurate color/texture matching and higher visual quality.

The main contributions are:

- Showing that both spatial consistency and inter-scale consistency of neural responses matter for quality.

- Determining relevant statistics to transfer through nearest-neighbor matching and consistency enforcement. 

- Introducing a painting estimator network to predict harmonization parameters based on style.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a dedicated two-pass approach with constrained neural statistic matching can achieve effective local painterly harmonization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. A two-pass algorithm for painterly harmonization to enable copying an object from a photo and pasting it into a painting seamlessly. The first pass achieves coarse harmonization by transferring overall style, and the second pass refines the results for accurate color/texture matching. 

2. Techniques to determine which neural response statistics to transfer for harmonization. The paper shows that spatial consistency and inter-scale consistency of the statistics matter for quality results.

3. A painting estimator network to predict harmonization parameters based on the style of the background painting. This makes the approach more robust to different painting styles.

4. Evaluations showing the approach succeeds on diverse inputs, outperforms other techniques, and often fools users into thinking the results are real unedited paintings in a user study.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be a dedicated algorithm for local painterly harmonization that carefully determines which statistics to transfer. This enables creative editing to realistically paste objects into paintings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a two-pass algorithm for painterly harmonization that achieves coarse harmonization in the first pass and fine multi-scale refinement in the second pass to produce high-quality composites that blend inserted elements seamlessly into paintings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the paper, here are some key ways this research compares to other work in painterly image harmonization and style transfer:

- The authors propose a two-pass algorithm while much previous work uses a single-pass approach. They found the two-pass method produces better results by allowing a coarse harmonization pass followed by refinement.

- They use a nearest neighbor matching of neural activation patches between the input image and painting style, while other methods like Gatys et al. match global statistics. The local matching helps transfer more relevant style. 

- They enforce consistency of the neural patch matches across network layers and spatial locations. Other methods like Li & Wand match layers independently which can cause artifacts.

- They introduce losses like the unique style loss and histogram loss to improve reconstruction during stylization. This helps capture some texture properties better than methods relying only on Gram matrices.

- They train a painting estimator network to predict good harmonization parameters based on the painting style, avoiding manual parameter tweaking.

- Their focus is on local harmonization for image compositing rather than global stylization. They demonstrate global methods don't work as well locally.

- Their two user studies help quantify the realism and quality of their results compared to other methods. This provides evidence their approach better achieves local painterly harmonization.

So in summary, this work introduces algorithmic innovations tailored for the local harmonization task that improve over global style transfer methods applied locally. The comparative evaluations help validate these contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing fast feed-forward network approximations of their optimization framework. The current approach relies on iterative optimization which is slower. Approximating it with a feed-forward neural network could enable real-time performance.

- Extending their approach to video, for painterly video compositing. The current method works on individual images.

- Further exploring the difference between local and global statistics of paintings and how that impacts style transfer. Their work suggests there are fundamental differences that could be studied further.

- Allowing the user to provide a second style image with matching content when the main style image does not contain elements that semantically match the inserted object. This could help address some failure cases.

- Mitigating cases where the pasted object becomes overly stylized and nearly invisible. This could be done by overriding the automatic stylization strength prediction with manual settings.

- Exploring modifications to the VGG network, such as proposed in other work, to address artifacts caused by the filters used in the network. However, this would require retraining the VGG network.

In summary, they suggest directions like extending the approach to video, exploring the differences between local and global painting statistics more, addressing limitations like occlusion and artifacts, and speeding up the technique with neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper describes a two-pass algorithm for painterly harmonization when compositing an object from a photo into a painting. The first pass uses independent nearest-neighbor mappings on each layer of a neural network to achieve robust but coarse harmonization. The second pass enforces spatial consistency across layers and removes outliers to achieve high-quality local refinement. A painting estimator predicts harmonization parameters based on the abstraction level of the painting. Comparisons to existing methods and user studies demonstrate the approach succeeds on a variety of inputs and often fools observers into thinking the results are unedited paintings. The work suggests fundamental differences exist between global and local image statistics that warrant further exploration.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a two-pass algorithm for painterly harmonization when compositing an object from a photo into a painting. The first pass produces a coarse harmonization by matching neural patches independently on each layer to achieve robustness. The second pass refines the result for quality by enforcing consistency across layers and spatial coherence. Specifically, the second pass works on a single reference layer to generate correspondences and propagates them to other layers. It also removes outlier matches and selects neural responses that were collocated in the original painting. Overall, the two passes address the limitations of previous single-pass approaches and improve spatial and inter-scale consistency. 

The authors also train a painting estimator network to predict good parameter settings based on the style of the painting. This avoids having to manually tweak parameters per painting. Evaluations show the approach succeeds across diverse inputs and styles, often fooling users into thinking results are unedited paintings. Comparisons to other methods demonstrate better quality on challenging cases with visible brushwork. The work enables creative editing that previous photo compositing or global stylization techniques could not achieve.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a two-pass algorithm for painterly harmonization of an object pasted into a painting. In the first pass, they use nearest-neighbor mapping independently on each layer of a neural network to match the pasted object to semantically similar regions in the painting, producing an intermediate result. In the second pass, they enforce consistency across layers by mapping all activations for a given spatial location to the same region in the painting. They also improve the reconstruction process by using a modified style loss and adding histogram and total variation losses. The two passes combined allow the method to be robust to style differences while achieving high quality results.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the key points from the paper are:

- The paper is addressing the problem of copying an object from a photo and seamlessly pasting it into a painting. Existing techniques designed for photographic compositing or global painterly stylization do not work well for this local painterly compositing task. 

- The main challenges are handling the brushwork texture and level of abstraction typical of paintings, while also ensuring spatial and inter-scale consistency when transferring relevant statistics from the painting to the pasted object.

- Their approach uses a two-pass algorithm. The first pass achieves coarse harmonization of the pasted object to the painting's style. The second pass refines the result for high visual quality by enforcing consistent mappings across layers and image space.

- A painting estimator network is proposed to predict suitable algorithm parameters based on the level of stylization of the background painting. This makes the approach more robust to different painting styles.

- The results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to produce plausible local painterly composites that often appear unedited to users, for a variety of input images and painting styles.

In summary, the key contribution is a dedicated algorithm for seamless local painterly compositing, addressing limitations of existing global techniques when applied locally. The approach carefully determines which statistics to transfer to match the painting's style spatially and across scales.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach for painterly compositing, which involves copying an object from a photo and pasting it into a painting seamlessly such that the composite still looks like a genuine painting. The authors introduce a two-pass algorithm to achieve this. The first pass performs a rough match of the color and texture properties of the pasted region to semantically similar regions in the painting to achieve coarse harmonization. The second pass refines the result by enforcing consistency across network layers and image space during the input-to-style mapping to accurately match the painting's color and texture. This is done by mapping neural response statistics in a way that ensures activations assigned to the same image location on different layers were already collocated in the style image. The authors also introduce a painting estimator to adjust the transfer parameters based on the estimated level of stylization of the input painting. Experiments demonstrate that the approach succeeds on diverse input and is often able to fool viewers into thinking the composites are genuine paintings. Comparisons to other methods show the approach produces superior quality.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel algorithm for painterly image harmonization, enabling the seamless compositing of photographic elements into paintings. The key idea is a two-pass approach that first achieves coarse harmonization using robust nearest-neighbor mapping between neural activations, followed by a refinement pass with a constrained mapping that enforces spatial and inter-scale consistency. Specifically, the first pass matches color and texture properties between the pasted region and semantically similar areas in the painting using independent nearest-neighbor mapping on each VGG layer. The second pass starts from this intermediate result and focuses on visual quality, using a single reference layer for correspondence and propagating this to other layers. It also processes the mapping to enforce spatial consistency. The final image is reconstructed using style, content, histogram, and total variation losses. A painting estimator network is introduced to predict harmonization parameters based on the painting's style. Comparisons to recent methods and user studies demonstrate improved quality and perception of results as genuine paintings. The approach enables creative edits by seamlessly introducing photographic elements into a wide variety of painting styles.
