# [Pervasive Attention: 2D Convolutional Neural Networks for   Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03867)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether an alternative neural machine translation architecture based on 2D convolutional neural networks can be competitive with state-of-the-art encoder-decoder models with attention. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) A deep 2D convolutional neural network defined over the product space of source and target positions can learn an effective joint encoding of the two sequences.

2) This joint encoding allows the model to have implicit attention capabilities, since each layer re-encodes the source conditioned on the target sequence so far. 

3) This approach can yield competitive translation performance compared to standard encoder-decoder architectures, while being conceptually simpler and using fewer parameters.

So in summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a novel 2D CNN architecture for neural machine translation as an alternative to prevalent encoder-decoder models augmented with attention mechanisms. The key research questions are whether this approach can work effectively for translation while having useful properties like implicit attention and parameter efficiency. The experiments aim to validate the competitive performance of the proposed model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and conclusion, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel neural machine translation architecture based on a single 2D convolutional neural network applied across the source and target sequences. This contrasts with standard encoder-decoder architectures that process the sequences separately. 

- The 2D convolutions with masked filters allow the model to have implicit attention capabilities built into each layer, rather than relying on a separate "add-on" attention module like most encoder-decoder models.

- This approach allows joint encoding of the source and target sequences into a deep feature hierarchy where the source tokens are embedded in the context of the partial target sequence so far. 

- Max pooling over this joint encoding is used to predict the next target token in an autoregressive fashion.

- The model achieves strong results on German-English and English-German translation tasks on the IWSLT 2014 dataset, outperforming several standard encoder-decoder baselines while using a conceptually simpler architecture with fewer parameters.

- The max pooling operator produces implicit alignments between source and target sentences that are qualitatively similar to standard attention mechanisms.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new convolutional architecture for machine translation that jointly models the source and target sequences in a unified 2D structure and inherently captures attention-like properties without needing a separate attention module.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel neural machine translation architecture based on a single 2D convolutional neural network applied across both the source and target sequences, allowing the model to re-encode the source tokens in the context of the partial target sequence generated so far, thus inherently providing attention-like capabilities throughout the layers of the network.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper proposes a novel neural machine translation architecture that uses a single 2D convolutional neural network to jointly model the source and target sequences. Here are a few key ways this approach compares to other research in neural machine translation:

- Most current approaches use encoder-decoder architectures with separate modules to encode the source and decode the target. This paper proposes modeling source and target together in a single network.

- Typical encoder-decoder models incorporate attention mechanisms that are limited to re-weighting a fixed encoding of the source. The proposed 2D CNN continuously re-encodes the source in the context of the partial target output, inherently building in "attention-like" capabilities. 

- Rather than recurrent or 1D convolutional networks, this paper leverages recent advances in 2D CNNs for images to learn hierarchical features over the source/target grid. This allows parallel computation and deep feature learning.

- Experiments on German-English translation show the proposed model achieves competitive BLEU scores with simpler architecture and fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art encoder-decoder networks.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of a single 2D CNN on the combined input space to jointly model source and target. This contrasts with the typical modular encoder-decoder approach. The results demonstrate 2D CNNs are a promising avenue for further exploration in machine translation. The idea of pervasive attention built into the model architecture is also notable compared to standard attentional mechanisms.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring hybrid approaches where the input to the joint source-target encoding model comes from 1D source and target embedding networks (e.g. bi-LSTMs or 1D convolutional networks) rather than just token embeddings. This could potentially improve performance further.

- Applying the model to translate across multiple language pairs. The current experiments are limited to German-English and English-German translation. Testing on more language pairs could demonstrate the generalizability of the approach.

- Combining the 2D convolutional encoder-decoder approach with more traditional 1D encoders and decoders in a hybrid architecture. For example, using a 1D convolutional encoder and 2D convolutional decoder.

- Exploring other alternatives to the standard encoder-decoder paradigm, using the 2D convolutional approach as inspiration. The authors hope their work sparks more research into new types of sequence-to-sequence models beyond encoder-decoders.

- Improving computational efficiency and reducing training time, since the 2D convolutions have higher complexity than standard encoder-decoder models.

In summary, the main future directions are testing the approach on more tasks/datasets, exploring hybrid models, and researching new sequence-to-sequence architectures motivated by the success of the 2D convolutional modeling. The authors see their model as a proof-of-concept for future work on alternative designs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel neural machine translation architecture based on a single 2D convolutional neural network that jointly encodes the source and target sequences. Rather than using separate encoder and decoder modules with an attention mechanism in between, each layer of the 2D CNN re-encodes the source tokens based on the target sequence generated so far. This allows the model to have inherent attention-like capabilities since each layer repeatedly looks at the source in light of the evolving target context. The convolutions use masking to ensure autoregressive generation of the target sequence. The model is evaluated on German-English IWSLT translation tasks and achieves strong performance competitive with encoder-decoder models while using fewer parameters. The authors suggest their alternative joint source-target encoding approach could inspire new architectures beyond the prevalent encoder-decoder paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an alternative neural machine translation architecture based on a single 2D convolutional neural network applied across both the source and target sequences. Each convolutional layer re-encodes the source tokens based on the target sequence generated so far, enabling attention-like properties throughout the network. Specifically, the source and target sequences are first embedded and concatenated to form a 3D input tensor. Then, a series of 2D convolutional layers with masked filters are applied to this tensor to prohibit accessing future target tokens. Max pooling is used across the source dimension to obtain predictions for each target token. 

The model is evaluated on German-English and English-German IWSLT translation tasks. It achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art encoder-decoder models while being conceptually simpler and having fewer parameters. The max pooling operator generates implicit alignments similar to those from attention mechanisms. Overall, the proposed pervasive attention architecture provides an alternative to current encoder-decoder translation models. Key advantages are its implicit attention properties and joint modelling of the source and target sequences rather than separate encoding and decoding steps.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a machine translation architecture based on a single 2D convolutional neural network that operates on the product space of source and target sequence positions. The convolutional filters are masked so that no information from future target tokens is used, making the model autoregressive. This allows the network to learn deep feature hierarchies that encode the source tokens based on the target sequence generated so far at each layer. The source dimension is collapsed via max pooling over this joint encoding to produce a prediction for the next target token. Thus, the model inherently has attention-like capabilities in each layer rather than using a separate attention module. The full network is implemented as a DenseNet CNN with masked convolutions and trained on sequence pairs using label smoothed cross-entropy loss. Results on German-English IWSLT translation tasks demonstrate the model is competitive with encoder-decoder models while being conceptually simpler.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the limitations of current attention mechanisms in neural machine translation models. The key problems/questions it aims to tackle are:

- Current attention mechanisms have limited modeling abilities and are generally just a weighted sum of the source representations. They are unable to re-encode or re-interpret the source sequence while decoding.

- The attention module in current models is an "add-on" component that recombines the same fixed source token encodings based on the decoder state. 

- Can an alternative architecture be developed that has inherent attention-like capabilities without needing a separate attention module?

To address these issues, the paper proposes a novel neural machine translation architecture based on 2D convolutional neural networks. The key idea is to jointly encode the source and target sequences into a deep feature hierarchy, with the source tokens embedded in the context of the partial target sequence generated so far. This allows implicit attention-like properties to be pervasive throughout the model rather than confined to a separate module. The paper aims to show this approach can be competitive or better than current encoder-decoder architectures with attention, while being conceptually simpler.

In summary, the key focus is on developing an inherently attentive neural translation model that moves beyond the limitations of current added-on attention mechanisms, by jointly encoding the source and target sequences with masked convolutions over their 2D representation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, some key terms and concepts are:

- Encoder-decoder architecture - The current state-of-the-art machine translation systems are based on encoder-decoder architectures. The encoder encodes the input sequence into a vector representation and the decoder generates the output sequence based on this encoding.

- Attention mechanism - The encoder-decoder models typically incorporate an attention mechanism which allows the decoder to focus on salient parts of the input sequence while generating the output. 

- 2D convolutional neural network - The authors propose an alternative approach using a single 2D CNN applied across both input and output sequences.

- Masked convolutions - The 2D CNN uses masked convolutions to prevent accessing future target tokens, making it autoregressive.

- Implicit attention - The proposed 2D CNN has inherent attention-like properties since each layer re-encodes the input based on the output generated so far. No explicit attention module is needed.

- Fewer parameters - The proposed model achieves competitive results with fewer parameters compared to standard encoder-decoder architectures.

- Joint source-target encoding - The model jointly encodes the input and output sequences into a shared representation using the 2D convolutions.

In summary, the key ideas are replacing the typical encoder-decoder structure with a jointly trained 2D CNN that has inherent attention, and showing this simpler model can achieve strong results in machine translation.

This paper proposes a novel neural machine translation architecture based on 2D convolutional neural networks instead of the standard encoder-decoder approach. The model builds a 2D grid where one dimension is the source sequence and the other is the target sequence. It applies a stack of 2D convolutional layers on this grid, using masked convolutions to prevent the network from seeing future target tokens.
