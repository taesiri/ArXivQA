# [Natural Language Processing and Multimodal Stock Price Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01487)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting stock prices and trends is an important element of financial decision-making. Prior works have used techniques like LSTM networks, SVMs, and NLP models, but this paper explores a new approach - using stock percentage change instead of raw price values as training data.  

- The reason for using percentage change is to provide more context and significance to price fluctuations. A \$5 drop means more for a \$50 stock than a \$6000 stock. The goal is to help models make more informed predictions.

Methods:
- Collected ~8,000 news articles matched to stock prices changes for S&P500 companies, and ~700 articles for tech companies specifically. 

- Tested multiple modalities of data fed to the model: headlines only, headlines + company, headlines + source, etc. Used a tiny BERT NLP architecture with 14.5M parameters.

- Compared model accuracy for exact price prediction vs symbolic directional prediction (up/down). Evaluated on metrics like price direction accuracy and MSE loss.

Results:
- Many versions of the models outperformed LSTM benchmarks, especially for capturing overall trends despite variability in short-term predictions.

- Best results came from model version only fed headlines + company name, without extraneous info like dates. Indicates these are the most predictive features.  

- Symbolic directional training performed nearly as well as exact price training. Grouping by sector did not noticeably improve accuracy.

Conclusions:
- NLP models show promise for aiding human investors by providing general market trends and validation, but may not reliably stand alone for trading decisions.

- More research needed on optimal modalities to feed models, integrating raw price data, and combining human+AI capabilities.

In summary, the paper introduces a new NLP approach to stock prediction focused on percentage changes, and provides insights into useful data modalities and model design choices. The tiny BERT architecture proved capable of capturing general trends helpful for human investors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops natural language processing models using a BERT architecture to predict stock price trends based on news headlines, with a focus on comparing different input data modalities and using percentage price change rather than raw price values.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is using stock percentage change as training data for predicting stock prices, rather than the traditional use of raw currency values. 

Specifically, the paper states:

"This paper is not the first on the prediction of stock prices using natural language processing, but it does touch upon a new technique: the use of percentage change as training data. Most models that aim to predict the stock market use raw currency values\cite{8920761}, and very few papers have incorporated relative price increase and decrease via the use of percent change into study, indicating that this topic is prominent for research."

So the key contribution is using the percentage change in stock prices, rather than just the raw price values, as input data to train models to predict future stock price trends. The reasoning is that percentage change provides more context about the significance of price fluctuations. This is the unique aspect that the paper is proposing and evaluating.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Stock price prediction
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks
- Support vector machines (SVMs)
- Sentiment analysis
- BERT models
- Percentage change
- Data modalities
- Mean squared error (MSE)
- Model accuracy
- Price direction
- Sector-specific data

The paper focuses on using NLP and BERT models to predict stock price trends and percentage changes. It compares the performance of these models to more traditional techniques like LSTMs and SVMs. The models are trained on news headlines and tested on metrics like price direction accuracy and MSE. There is also analysis around the impact of different data modalities and sector-specific datasets. So those are some of the central themes and terms covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using percentage change as the training data instead of raw currency values. Why was this choice made and what advantage does using percentage change provide over raw values for stock price prediction?

2. The paper evaluates several versions of data modalities provided to the model, including article headlines only, headlines and sources, etc. Which data modalities led to the highest accuracy models? Does adding more modalities always increase accuracy?

3. The BERT-Tiny model with only 14.5M parameters is used. Why was this small model chosen over larger BERT models? What advantages and disadvantages come with using a smaller BERT model?  

4. Mean squared error (MSE) is used as the loss function. Why is MSE well-suited for this task compared to other loss functions? What are the effects of using MSE loss on model training?

5. The model seems effective at capturing long-term trends but less accurate on short-term predictions. What could be the reasons behind this behavior? How might the model be improved to increase short-term accuracy?

6. It is mentioned sector-specific models do not necessarily perform better than general models spanning industries. Why might this be the case? When would industry-specific models be more impactful?

7. The effects of symbolic versus non-symbolic training are analyzed. What differences emerge between these two training procedures and what conclusions are drawn about the need for exact price data?

8. How well does the model proposed here compare to baseline LSTM models on metrics like price direction accuracy and closeness to true prices? What are some advantages of BERT models over LSTM models for this application?

9. The paper mentions combining human and model predictions could prove useful. How specifically might human experts complement the model's capabilities and vice versa? What would such a system look like?

10. The conclusion states raw price factors could be integrated into the model. How might providing historical raw price data augment the model's capabilities? What impact would you expect this to have?
