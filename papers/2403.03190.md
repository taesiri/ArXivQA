## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Addressed:
The paper tackles the challenging problems of abstract reasoning, specifically the Bongard-Logo problem and Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). These require an understanding of abstract concepts, relationships and rules that are not apparent from surface features. Existing deep learning methods struggle with such abstract reasoning tasks.

Proposed Methods:
Several methods are proposed:

1) Cross-Feature Net (CFN): Implicitly reorganizes the conceptual space of conflicting Bongard-Logo instances using cross-attention between concept vectors and image feature vectors. Achieves strong results on Bongard-Logo problem.

2) Triple-CFN: Enhances CFN by adding a cross-covariance loss term to reduce correlation between feature dimensions. Further improves Bongard-Logo performance. Also achieves state-of-the-art results on RAVEN RPM dataset by incorporating multi-viewpoint features and multi-evaluation reasoning.

3) Meta Triple-CFN: Tailored for RPM problems. Explicitly structures the problem space using metadata on progressive patterns as additional supervision. Maintains interpretability while achieving top performance on PGM dataset. 

4) Re-space Layer: Normalizes reasoning information by mapping minimal reasoning unit vectors to a learned vector space. Boosts both Triple-CFN and Meta Triple-CFN when incorporated.

Main Contributions:
- Novel network architectures specifically designed for abstract reasoning tasks 
- Implicit/explicit reorganization of conceptual problem spaces
- Multi-viewpoint and multi-evaluation reasoning mechanisms
- Normalization of reasoning information via Re-space layer
- State-of-the-art results on Bongard-Logo, RAVEN and PGM datasets
- Balancing model interpretability and reasoning accuracy

The methods provide fundamental advancements in tackling abstract reasoning challenges through innovative neural network designs and modeling of conceptual spaces.
