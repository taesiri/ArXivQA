# [Rational Sensibility: LLM Enhanced Empathetic Response Generation Guided   by Self-presentation Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08702)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summarization of the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes a new model called Lamb for improving empathetic response generation. The key ideas are:
1) Utilize self-presentation theory from sociology to distinguish between "sensible" emotional sentences and rational sentences in the dialogue context. This enhances understanding of the speaker's emotions and sentiment.
2) Introduce a new "Chain of Emotion-aware Empathetic prompting" method called CoNECT that uses the large language model LLaMA2-70b to provide additional "sensible reasoning" and global perspective for understanding the emotions and intentions behind the dialogue. 
3) Design a "sense-sensibility aware decoder" that combines the emotional context, commonsense knowledge, and CoNECT reasoning to generate responses that balance sensibility and rationality. This produces more coherent and empathetic responses.
4) Experiments on the EMPATHETICDIALOGUES dataset show Lamb outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both automatic metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, Distinct) and human evaluations of coherence, empathy, informativeness and continuity. For example, Lamb achieves the highest BLEU-4 score, reflecting consistency with ground truth responses.
5) Ablations and case studies confirm the value of both the CoNECT and self-presentation theory components for improving response quality.

In summary, Lamb advances the state-of-the-art for empathetic response generation through a novel integration of sociological theory, large language model reasoning, and balanced decoding focused on sensibility and rationality. Both quantitative metrics and human assessments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
