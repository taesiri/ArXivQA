# [Rational Sensibility: LLM Enhanced Empathetic Response Generation Guided   by Self-presentation Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08702)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summarization of the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes a new model called Lamb for improving empathetic response generation. The key ideas are:
1) Utilize self-presentation theory from sociology to distinguish between "sensible" emotional sentences and rational sentences in the dialogue context. This enhances understanding of the speaker's emotions and sentiment.
2) Introduce a new "Chain of Emotion-aware Empathetic prompting" method called CoNECT that uses the large language model LLaMA2-70b to provide additional "sensible reasoning" and global perspective for understanding the emotions and intentions behind the dialogue. 
3) Design a "sense-sensibility aware decoder" that combines the emotional context, commonsense knowledge, and CoNECT reasoning to generate responses that balance sensibility and rationality. This produces more coherent and empathetic responses.
4) Experiments on the EMPATHETICDIALOGUES dataset show Lamb outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both automatic metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, Distinct) and human evaluations of coherence, empathy, informativeness and continuity. For example, Lamb achieves the highest BLEU-4 score, reflecting consistency with ground truth responses.
5) Ablations and case studies confirm the value of both the CoNECT and self-presentation theory components for improving response quality.

In summary, Lamb advances the state-of-the-art for empathetic response generation through a novel integration of sociological theory, large language model reasoning, and balanced decoding focused on sensibility and rationality. Both quantitative metrics and human assessments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating empathetic responses in conversations requires models to accurately perceive emotions and respond appropriately. However, most models lack capabilities for sensible and rational expression that are important for cognitive empathy.  

- Prior work has limitations in using external knowledge sources, including semantic contradictions and narrow perspectives focused only on single utterances.

Proposed Solution:
- Guided by self-presentation theory from sociology, the paper proposes Lamb - an LLM enhanced model for empathetic response generation.

- Lamb has 3 main components:
1) Sensible knowledge enhancement: Utilizes emotion-cause recognition to identify sensible vs rational sentences in dialog history. 
2) Rational knowledge enhancement: Employs LLaMA2 for emotion-aware empathetic prompting (CoNECT) to provide global reasoning. Also uses COMET for commonsense knowledge.  
3) Sensibility-rationality aware decoder: Combines representations of dialog history, CoNECT data and COMET knowledge to generate responses.

Main Contributions:
- Applies self-presentation theory to focus on sensible and rational expressions in dialogs for better cognitive empathy.

- Introduces CoNECT method to provide sensible reasoning and global perspectives from Large Language Models. 

- Proposes Lamb model that combines weighted dialog history, CoNECT data and COMET knowledge for high-quality empathetic responses.

- Experiments show Lamb outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both automatic metrics and human evaluations.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative approach guided by sociological theory to enhance empathetic response generation, with very promising results that advance the state-of-the-art.
