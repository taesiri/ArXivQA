# [Deep neural networks as nested dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01297)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: how can we make the analogy between deep neural networks and brains/nervous systems more structurally precise, and what new insights does this provide? 

Specifically, the authors argue that the usual analogy made between artificial "neurons" in deep neural networks and biological neurons is flawed. They propose that a more accurate analogy is:

- The "neurons" (nodes) in deep neural networks are more akin to synapses in the brain.

- The wires connecting neurons in deep neural networks are more analogous to axons and dendrites of nerve cells in the brain. 

The authors then use category theory to make this revised analogy mathematically precise. This allows them to propose a new encompassing framework called "deeply interacting learning systems" (DILS) that combines strengths of deep neural networks and dynamical systems theory. The key benefits highlighted are:

- DILS allows for peer-to-peer messaging between components, unlike standard deep neural networks. 

- DILS allows for dynamic rewiring of connections over time, enabling adaptation.

- DILS unifies deep neural networks and control theory perspectives on dynamical systems.

So in summary, the key research contribution is using category theory to refine the analogy between deep learning and neuroscience, which enables a proposed new class of adaptive, interacting dynamical systems for learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new perspective on deep neural networks by making an analogy with interacting dynamical systems. Specifically:

- It points out an issue with the common analogy made between artificial neurons in DNNs and biological neurons, arguing this analogy is structurally flawed. 

- It proposes viewing DNNs as a special case of interacting dynamical systems with restricted interaction patterns, represented by interaction diagrams. 

- It notes that typical interacting dynamical systems have fixed wiring diagrams, while DNNs have dynamic rewiring through changing weights/biases. 

- It uses category theory to show these perspectives can be unified into a more general framework called deeply interacting learning systems (DILS), which allows both peer-to-peer messaging and dynamic rewiring.

- This provides a corrected analogy between DNNs and brains, with artificial neurons corresponding to biological synapses rather than neurons.

- It argues this DILS perspective combines strengths of DNNs (adaptivity) and dynamical systems (complex interactions), enabling new architectures and applications.

In summary, the key contribution is providing a new categorical perspective to unify and generalize DNNs and dynamical systems, repairing the neuron analogy and enabling more advanced learning systems. The formalism of DILS is presented as a foundation for further research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:

The paper argues that the usual analogy between artificial neurons in deep neural networks and nerve cells in brains is structurally flawed, and proposes a new encompassing mathematical framework called deeply interacting learning systems to better capture the complex, adaptive interactions found in both neural networks and brains.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on relating deep learning and neuroscience:

- The main novelty is using category theory to formalize the analogy between deep neural networks (DNNs) and brains. This provides a precise framework for comparing the two, whereas most other work makes informal analogies. 

- It critiques the common analogy between artificial neurons in DNNs and biological neurons. The authors argue this analogy is structurally flawed, and propose viewing artificial neurons more like synapses instead.

- It connects ideas from DNNs and control theory, viewing both as kinds of interacting dynamical systems. This perspective allows combining strengths of each - peer-to-peer communication and adaptivity.

- The proposed deeply interacting learning systems (DILS) combine features of DNNs and control theory systems. DILS are more general and adaptive than either alone.

- Overall, this paper takes a more mathematical approach than most work relating DNNs and neuroscience. The category theory perspective is unique and enables formalizing the analogies precisely.

- Most other work focuses on things like comparing representations learned by DNNs to brain areas, analyzing DNN elements like depth or recurrent connections as brain-like, or using neuroscience inspiration for specific network architecture designs.

So in summary, this paper provides a formal mathematical framework for comparing DNNs and brains, critiques the standard analogy, and proposes an encompassing model combining strengths of DNNs and control theory. The categorical perspective is novel compared to more informal analogies drawn by other works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Further exploring the mathematical framework of deeply interacting learning systems (DILS). The paper introduces this framework as a way to combine the strengths of deep neural networks and interacting dynamical systems, but the possible applications are still unexplored. More work could be done to develop the theory and applications of DILS.

- Implementing and testing actual DILS models. The paper lays out the theory, but concrete DILS models have not yet been implemented and tested. Building and training DILS could reveal new capabilities and limitations compared to standard deep learning models.

- Exploring the analogy between DILS and biological neural systems further. The authors suggest DILS may better capture the adaptive peer-to-peer communication in biological brains than standard deep nets. Comparative studies could further test the merits of the analogy. 

- Developing new training procedures suited to DILS. The continuous online learning setup of DILS differs from the discrete training/testing phases of deep learning. New techniques may be needed to effectively train online DILS models.

- Applying DILS to challenging control problems and environments. The paper situates DILS in a control theory context. Testing DILS on real-world control tasks could demonstrate their advantages.

- Using category theory to formalize other analogies in machine learning. The authors show how category theory can make the analogy between deep nets and brains mathematically precise. This approach could potentially clarify other informal analogies as well.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper argues that the common analogy made between artificial neurons in deep neural networks and biological neurons is flawed. It proposes viewing the "neurons" in DNNs as more akin to biological synapses instead. The analogy should be between the wires in DNNs and biological neurons, since both allow information to flow. The paper uses category theory and the mathematical formalism of dynamical systems to make this analogy precise. It introduces the concept of deeply interacting learning systems (DILS) which combine complex interaction patterns from control theory with adaptivity from DNNs. DILS provide a framework to understand learning systems that have peer-to-peer messaging between components and changeable wiring diagrams over time. Overall, the paper uses category theory to clarify the analogy between DNNs and brains in a mathematically rigorous way.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper argues that the common analogy made between artificial neurons in deep neural networks and biological neurons is flawed. The authors claim that artificial neurons actually correspond better to synapses in the brain, while the wires between layers in neural networks are more analogous to axons. This is because artificial neurons mainly manage weights, similar to how synapses manage connection strengths, while axons transmit signals between neurons. 

To develop a more accurate analogy, the authors represent deep neural networks as interacting dynamical systems using category theory. They introduce the concept of "deeply interacting learning systems" which combine complex peer-to-peer interaction like in control theory with the adaptivity of deep neural networks. This allows dynamic rewiring of connections over time. The authors argue this encompassing framework provides a better analogy between deep learning and neuroscience, correcting the mismatch between artificial and biological neurons.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called deeply interactive learning systems (DILS) that combines ideas from deep neural networks and interacting dynamical systems. It argues that the usual analogy made between artificial neurons in deep neural networks and biological neurons is flawed. The paper uses category theory and the formalism of polynomial functors to show that artificial neurons are more analogous to biological synapses, while the wires connecting them are more akin to neurons. DILS allows for non-trivial peer-to-peer messaging between components, like interacting dynamical systems, as well as adaptable interaction patterns that can change over time, like deep neural networks. The paper argues DILS combines the strengths of both approaches into a more powerful and biologically plausible framework.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The main problems/questions addressed in this paper are:

1. There is a flawed analogy made between artificial neurons in deep neural networks and real neurons in brains. The paper argues that artificial neurons correspond better to synapses, while the wires in DNNs correspond to neurons. 

2. Typical deep neural networks have no internal "peer-to-peer" communication between artificial neurons. The paper asks if we can create systems that have both complex internal communication and the ability to adapt over time like DNNs do. 

3. The paper introduces the concept of "deeply interacting learning systems" (DILS) which combine features of interacting dynamical systems and deep neural networks. DILS allow for peer-to-peer communication between components and changeable interaction patterns over time.

4. The paper tries to clarify the analogy between deep neural networks, interacting dynamical systems, and brains using category theory. The goal is to combine strengths of DNNs and IDS into a more general mathematical framework.

5. Overall, the paper aims to address flaws in the neuron analogy, allow more complex interactions in DNN-like systems, and use category theory to find connections between different types of dynamical systems. The end goal is a better understanding of how to create adaptable, learning systems.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper argues that the common analogy made between artificial neurons in deep neural networks and biological neurons is structurally flawed. The authors explain that in DNNs, the "neurons" actually correspond to synapses in the brain, while the wires correspond to neurons. They make the case that wires in DNNs should be viewed as interacting components like neurons, not just passive connectors. Using category theory, they formally show DNNs and interacting dynamical systems are mathematically analogous when artificial neurons are "unfolded" into interacting components. This suggests combining DNNs and dynamical systems into "deeply interacting learning systems" with complex peer-to-peer messaging and adaptable interactions. Overall, the paper uses category theory to correct the neural analogy and propose a new mathematical framework unifying deep learning and dynamical systems.

This paper argues that the common analogy made between artificial neurons in deep neural networks and biological neurons in the brain is structurally flawed. The authors suggest that artificial neurons actually correspond better to synapses in the brain, while the wires between artificial neurons correspond to biological neurons. They propose representing deep neural networks as a type of interacting dynamical system called deeply interactive learning systems, which allows for peer-to-peer communication between components as well as adaptable interaction patterns over time.
