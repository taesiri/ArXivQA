# [RoboFusion: Towards Robust Multi-Modal 3D obiect Detection via SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing state-of-the-art multi-modal 3D object detectors achieve excellent performance on clean datasets like KITTI and nuScenes. However, they lack robustness when tested on out-of-distribution (OOD) noisy scenarios, like bad weather conditions. This lack of generalization presents challenges for deploying such detectors in real-world autonomous driving applications.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a robust framework called "RoboFusion" that leverages the generalization capability and robustness of visual foundation models (VFMs) like SAM to adapt multi-modal 3D object detectors for handling OOD noisy scenarios. Specifically, the framework has the following key components:

1) SAM-AD: A version of SAM pretrained on autonomous driving datasets to extract more robust image features.

2) AD-FPN: A feature pyramid network to generate multi-scale features from SAM's output.

3) Depth-Guided Wavelet Attention (DGWA): Employs wavelet decomposition on depth-guided images to denoise image features. 

4) Adaptive Fusion: Uses self-attention to adaptively fuse image and LiDAR features, reweighing them based on noise levels.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to leverage generalization capability of VFMs like SAM to enhance robustness of multi-modal 3D detectors against OOD noise for autonomous driving.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on KITTI-C and nuScenes-C benchmarks across various weather and sensor noises, significantly outperforming previous methods. 

- Extensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of different components like SAM-AD, DGWA and Adaptive Fusion within the proposed framework.

In summary, the paper presents effective strategies to harness visual foundation models to boost robustness of multi-modal 3D detection, enabling better generalization to noisy real-world conditions for autonomous driving.
