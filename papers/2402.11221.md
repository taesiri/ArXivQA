# [MOB-Net: Limb-modularized Uncertainty Torque Learning of Humanoids for   Sensorless External Torque Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurately estimating external joint torques is challenging for humanoid robots due to model uncertainties like friction, inaccuracies in dynamics parameters, and sensor noise. Existing model-based methods like momentum observers suffer from large errors. End-to-end learning methods have better accuracy but poor generalization. There is a need for accurate and robust external torque estimation to enable collision detection and handling in humanoids without costly sensors like force-torque sensors.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes MOB-Net, a limb-modularized recurrent neural network architecture that combines a model-based momentum observer (MOB) and learning-based networks. It leverages the sparsity in the dynamics of different limbs. Separate networks estimate the uncertainty torques for different limbs which are subtracted from the MOB residual to get accurate external torque estimates.   

Key Contributions:

- Proposes limb-modularized network architecture MOB-Net for efficient whole-body uncertainty torque learning in humanoids

- Achieves significantly lower errors compared to MOB and end-to-end baselines in simulations and real robot experiments  

- Generalizes better to unseen collisions compared to end-to-end learning

- Enables sensitive collision detection using estimated torque and uncertainty 

- Demonstrates first active collision detection and handling scenarios in bipedal locomotion using only proprioceptive sensors

- Allows possibility of manufacturing affordable humanoids by replacing force-torque sensors with MOB-Net

In summary, the paper presents a method to accurately estimate external joint torques in humanoids using only proprioceptive sensors through an efficient neural network architecture. This enables collision detection and handling during locomotion without costly sensors, enhancing safety and reducing costs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a limb-modularized neural network called MOB-Net that learns model uncertainty torques of a humanoid robot to accurately estimate external joint torques for sensorless collision detection and handling during locomotion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contributions are:

1. It proposes MOB-Net, a limb-modularized recurrent neural network architecture that estimates the model uncertainty torque of humanoid robots using only proprioceptive sensors. By integrating MOB (momentum observer) with deep learning, MOB-Net achieves significantly more accurate estimation of external joint torques compared to model-based methods alone.

2. Through extensive simulations and real robot experiments, the paper demonstrates the superior and robust performance of MOB-Net in estimating external joint torques, even for unseen collision data. This enables sensitive collision detection without using expensive external sensors like force/torque sensors.  

3. For the first time, the paper presents active collision detection and reaction scenarios for bipedal humanoid robots during walking, using only the estimated external joint torques from MOB-Net. This collision handling capability implemented alongside the balancing controller can prevent humanoid robots from falling over after collisions.

4. The proposed method contributes to realizing safer and lower-cost humanoid robots by replacing force/torque sensors with MOB-Net's model uncertainty torque learning using only proprioceptive sensors. Although force/torque sensors are still needed temporarily during training data collection.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing MOB-Net to accurately estimate external joint torques for collision detection/handling in humanoids, using only internal sensors, thereby improving safety and reducing costs.
