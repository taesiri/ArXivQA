# [MOB-Net: Limb-modularized Uncertainty Torque Learning of Humanoids for   Sensorless External Torque Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurately estimating external joint torques is challenging for humanoid robots due to model uncertainties like friction, inaccuracies in dynamics parameters, and sensor noise. Existing model-based methods like momentum observers suffer from large errors. End-to-end learning methods have better accuracy but poor generalization. There is a need for accurate and robust external torque estimation to enable collision detection and handling in humanoids without costly sensors like force-torque sensors.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes MOB-Net, a limb-modularized recurrent neural network architecture that combines a model-based momentum observer (MOB) and learning-based networks. It leverages the sparsity in the dynamics of different limbs. Separate networks estimate the uncertainty torques for different limbs which are subtracted from the MOB residual to get accurate external torque estimates.   

Key Contributions:

- Proposes limb-modularized network architecture MOB-Net for efficient whole-body uncertainty torque learning in humanoids

- Achieves significantly lower errors compared to MOB and end-to-end baselines in simulations and real robot experiments  

- Generalizes better to unseen collisions compared to end-to-end learning

- Enables sensitive collision detection using estimated torque and uncertainty 

- Demonstrates first active collision detection and handling scenarios in bipedal locomotion using only proprioceptive sensors

- Allows possibility of manufacturing affordable humanoids by replacing force-torque sensors with MOB-Net

In summary, the paper presents a method to accurately estimate external joint torques in humanoids using only proprioceptive sensors through an efficient neural network architecture. This enables collision detection and handling during locomotion without costly sensors, enhancing safety and reducing costs.
