# [Can Language Beat Numerical Regression? Language-Based Multimodal   Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional pedestrian trajectory prediction methods treat trajectories as continuous signal values and use numerical regression models to forecast future paths. However, these physics-based models have limitations in capturing high-level social reasoning between pedestrians. 

Solution:
This paper proposes a language-based trajectory predictor (LBMTP) that converts the trajectory forecasting task into a question-answering format. Specifically, it transforms raw trajectory coordinates and scene images into textual prompts using decimal notations and image captioning. The prompts are fed into language models based on a question-answering template to predict future trajectories. Several techniques are introduced to enhance the model:

- A numerical tokenizer is optimized to handle decimal numbers in the prompts. 
- Multi-task training on auxiliary reasoning tasks (e.g. group detection) is used.  
- Beam search and temperature tuning are incorporated for deterministic and stochastic prediction.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new language-based formulation for trajectory forecasting using QA prompts
- Introduces specialized techniques like numerical tokenizer and multi-task training to enhance language models for this task
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on pedestrian trajectory benchmarks, outperforming prior numerical regression models
- Demonstrates the ability of language models to capture high-level social reasoning for trajectory forecasting beyond just physics-based interactions

The key insight is that language models can provide better context understanding and generalization for trajectory forecasting if the right techniques are used to specialize them for this numeric sequence prediction task. By converting trajectories into textual prompts, the models can capture both social interactions and sequential patterns.
