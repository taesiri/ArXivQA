# [A Causality-Aware Pattern Mining Scheme for Group Activity Recognition   in a Pervasive Sensor Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00404)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new scheme for group activity recognition in pervasive sensor spaces. The key goal is to achieve high accuracy while being robust to noise and having low computational overhead. The scheme uses an ontology and rules to detect causally related event pairs in sensor streams, preserving information about temporal ordering. It learns sequential patterns of these events for each group activity using a pattern tree algorithm. For recognition on new data, it matches event patterns and computes a weighted likelihood score to classify group activities. Experiments show the scheme has significantly higher accuracy (21-30\% better F1) than alternative approaches including association rule mining, a graphical model, and HMMs. It also degrades slower with added noise and has constant runtime as more training data is added, unlike some alternatives. The scheme is demonstrated on a 14 month 101T dataset from a real testbed as well as a public dataset. By carefully preserving causality and temporal relations between sensor events, the scheme achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for group activity recognition using pervasive sensors.
