# [Alignment Studio: Aligning Large Language Models to Particular   Contextual Regulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09704)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned by model providers to prevent common harms, but this does not cover alignment to particular contextual regulations that are unique to different industries, cultures, laws etc.  
- There is a need for application developers to be able to customize LLM behavior to their own contextual regulations in a transparent, auditable way.

Proposed Solution - Alignment Studio
- A principled architecture with 3 key components:
  1. Framers: Identifies essential knowledge from regulations and creates instruction and scenario data to teach the LLM. Uses both expert and LLM-generated data.  
  2. Instructors: Uses supervision and reinforcement learning to instill desired behaviors into LLM based on data from Framers. Handles competing requirements.
  3. Auditors: Ensures model alignment using evaluation and red teaming. Checks model at different points in development lifecycle.

- Allows aligning LLMs to detailed, particular regulations in a transparent and auditable way, giving more control to application developers.

Key Contributions:
- Concept of aligning LLMs to unique contextual regulations beyond common alignment done by model providers 
- Alignment Studio, a novel architecture with Framers, Instructors, Auditors components that enables contextually-customized alignment
- Demonstration of methodology by aligning LLM to IBM Business Conduct Guidelines
- Empowers app developers to shape LLM behavior to their values and regulations

The paper provides an end-to-end solution for aligning LLMs to detailed and unique regulations in different contexts, enabling customizable and ethical LLM behavior.
