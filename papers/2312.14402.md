# [The Fairness Fair: Bringing Human Perception into Collective   Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fairness is a fundamental principle for ethical collective decision-making, but current mathematical definitions and algorithmic solutions for fairness do not fully capture intricacies of human perception and judgement. 
- There is a need to align fairness axioms and algorithmic solutions with human values and societal cognition.

Proposed Solution:
- Argue for a broader research agenda in fair division grounded in human perception of fairness across three dimensions:

1) Alignment with Human Value Judgements
- Revisit common fairness axioms (e.g. envy-freeness, proportionality) in light of human cognitive biases and social context
- Study competing axioms and develop a hierarchy based on human preferences
- Factors influencing perception: transparency, self-interest vs fairness for all, motivation and framing effects, procedural vs distributive fairness

2) Uncertainty and Temporal Effects 
- Study impact of uncertainty, dynamic environments, and sequential allocations on perceived fairness

3) Verification of Fairness
- Enable human-interpretable proofs of fairness, not just mathematical guarantees
- Develop privacy-preserving and visually interactive verification
- Provide justifications and explanations for outcomes aligned with human rationale

Main Contributions:
- Identified need and laid out research agenda for incorporating human perception, cognition, and values into fairness notions and algorithms
- Highlighted open challenges across three dimensions of alignment, uncertainty, and verification
- Called for interdisciplinary approaches spanning AI, economics, psychology to address these challenges

The paper makes a strong case that grounding fairness research in human values and explanation is critical for adoption of algorithmic solutions, and outlines key open questions for future work in this emerging area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper argues for bringing human perception and societal values into algorithmic fairness research in order to develop new fairness axioms aligned with human judgments and enable individuals to verify and interact with fair solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is arguing for a broader research agenda in fair division that incorporates human perception and cognition into the design and evaluation of fairness axioms and algorithmic solutions. 

Specifically, the paper discusses the need to:

1) Revisit existing fairness axioms and evaluate them in light of complexities in human perception, to see which ones align more closely with human notions of fairness. 

2) Investigate competing fairness axioms and their compatibility when interacting with human participants. 

3) Develop a hierarchy of axioms that reflects human preferences over different fairness concepts. 

4) Design new algorithms that adhere to fairness axioms aligned with human values.

5) Enable individuals to verify the fairness of algorithmic solutions through explanations, interactions, and proofs of fairness, while preserving privacy. 

The key insight is that fairness research should not treat humans as fully rational agents, but rather account for the cognitive, social, and contextual factors that influence human judgment of fairness. This requires a transdisciplinary approach spanning AI, economics, psychology and more. Overall, the goal is to make collective decision-making systems more accepted and aligned with human notions of what constitutes a fair outcome.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Fair division
- Fairness axioms (e.g. envy-freeness, proportionality, maximin share)
- Relaxations of fairness axioms (e.g. EF1, EFX)
- Human perception of fairness
- Alignment with human value judgments
- Cognitive aspects influencing fairness (e.g. transparency, inequality aversion, framing effects)  
- Procedural vs distributive justice
- Uncertainty and temporal effects 
- Fair lotteries
- Sequential fairness
- Dynamic settings
- Verification of fairness 
- Proof of fairness
- Privacy-preserving verification 
- Explainable fairness
- Human-AI interactions
- Preference elicitation
- Visualizations

The key focus of the paper seems to be on bringing human perception and cognition into algorithms and axioms for fair division, evaluating existing fairness notions based on human judgments, and developing new axioms and algorithms that align better with human values. It also discusses issues around verifying and explaining fairness of outcomes to participants.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that fairness axioms should be aligned with human value judgments. What methods does it propose to extract and quantify human value judgments regarding fairness? How can we develop a hierarchy of fairness axioms based on these human value judgments?

2. The paper discusses how factors like transparency, information sharing, and perception of fairness for self vs for all can impact human judgment of fairness. How can we design experiments or studies to quantify the effects of these factors on perceived fairness of different axioms? 

3. The paper talks about "skin in the game" and fairness judgments made by participating agents vs non-participating bystanders. How can we design algorithms that take into account and balance the potentially differing perspectives of these two types of agents?

4. The paper highlights the effects of agency, deliberation, motivation and context on perceived fairness. What kinds of interfaces or procedures for human-AI interaction could we design to give people more control and agency over fair division outcomes? How can we experimentally study the effects of these factors?

5. How can we quantify and compare the perceived fairness of distributive (outcome-based) vs procedural justice? What experiments could we conduct to study human judgments along this dimension?

6. The paper discusses fair lotteries and sequential fairness as ways to handle uncertainty and temporal effects. How can we model human perceptions of fairness under uncertainty over time? How should fair division algorithms take such perceptual factors into account?

7. What interactive interfaces and visualizations could make it easier for people to verify the fairness of allocation outcomes? How can we balance transparency for verification with privacy concerns?  

8. The paper advocates for "explainable fairness" - what metrics can we develop to evaluate the quality and human interpretability of explanations for why an allocation is fair? How can we generate such explanations?

9. What experimental techniques and tools from behavioral economics could we apply to elicit human preferences and measure perceived fairness of allocation outcomes? How can we avoid biases and framing effects?

10. The paper talks about aligning algorithms with human values and perceptions. What validation methodologies can we develop to effectively compare algorithms in human subject experiments and quantify how well they match human notions of fairness?
