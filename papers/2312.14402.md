# [The Fairness Fair: Bringing Human Perception into Collective   Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fairness is a fundamental principle for ethical collective decision-making, but current mathematical definitions and algorithmic solutions for fairness do not fully capture intricacies of human perception and judgement. 
- There is a need to align fairness axioms and algorithmic solutions with human values and societal cognition.

Proposed Solution:
- Argue for a broader research agenda in fair division grounded in human perception of fairness across three dimensions:

1) Alignment with Human Value Judgements
- Revisit common fairness axioms (e.g. envy-freeness, proportionality) in light of human cognitive biases and social context
- Study competing axioms and develop a hierarchy based on human preferences
- Factors influencing perception: transparency, self-interest vs fairness for all, motivation and framing effects, procedural vs distributive fairness

2) Uncertainty and Temporal Effects 
- Study impact of uncertainty, dynamic environments, and sequential allocations on perceived fairness

3) Verification of Fairness
- Enable human-interpretable proofs of fairness, not just mathematical guarantees
- Develop privacy-preserving and visually interactive verification
- Provide justifications and explanations for outcomes aligned with human rationale

Main Contributions:
- Identified need and laid out research agenda for incorporating human perception, cognition, and values into fairness notions and algorithms
- Highlighted open challenges across three dimensions of alignment, uncertainty, and verification
- Called for interdisciplinary approaches spanning AI, economics, psychology to address these challenges

The paper makes a strong case that grounding fairness research in human values and explanation is critical for adoption of algorithmic solutions, and outlines key open questions for future work in this emerging area.
