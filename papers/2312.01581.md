# [Signed Binarization: Unlocking Efficiency Through Repetition-Sparsity   Trade-Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01581)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of the repetition-sparsity trade-off to explain the inference inefficiency of binary and ternary weight quantization methods. It proposes Signed Binarization, a unified co-design framework that synergistically integrates hardware-software systems, quantization functions, and representation learning techniques to address this trade-off. Specifically, it performs local binarization that results in global ternarization, retaining the benefits of weight repetition while also exploiting sparsity. Signed Binarization pushes the Pareto frontier compared to prior binary methods, improving accuracy per effectual parameter. It also enhances computational efficiency, achieving a 26% inference speedup, doubling energy efficiency, and reducing density by 2.8x for ResNet 18. Detailed analysis shows that signed binarization generates a smaller distribution of effectual parameters nested within a larger distribution of total parameters, both of the same type, for a DNN block. The paper demonstrates the potential of signed binarization to shape the evolution of efficient and high-performing deep learning models.
