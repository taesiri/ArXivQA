# [Seamless: Multilingual Expressive and Streaming Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05187)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a draft summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a family of models called Seamless that aim to enable naturalistic, end-to-end, multilingual, and real-time speech translation. Seamless is comprised of three main models built upon the foundational multilingual multimodal machine translation (M4T) model. First, an improved version of M4T called M4T v2 delivers state-of-the-art semantic accuracy across speech and text translation tasks while supporting nearly 100 languages as input or output. Second, SeamlessExpressive enables translation that preserves vocal style, prosody, rhythm, speech rate and pauses. Third, SeamlessStreaming leverages the EMMA mechanism to generate low-latency target translations from streaming speech input without waiting for complete source utterances. To evaluate these models, the authors combined existing metrics with newly developed ones tailored for aspects like prosody and latency. They also conducted human evaluations and robustness testing. As the first unified model combining expressivity and streaming capabilities, Seamless marks an advance towards seamless cross-lingual communication in real-time. The authors publicly release the models to enable further research and applications for cross-language understanding.
