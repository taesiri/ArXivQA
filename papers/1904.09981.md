## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is proposing a new method called GraphNAS for automatic neural architecture search for graph neural networks (GNNs). The key problems/questions it aims to address are:

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents GraphNAS, a novel method that applies neural architecture search using reinforcement learning to automatically design graph neural network (GNN) architectures. GNNs have become popular for analyzing graph-structured data, but designing the architectures requires substantial manual effort and domain expertise. GraphNAS allows automating this process. 

Specifically, GraphNAS uses a recurrent network as a controller to generate descriptions of GNN architectures. The controller is trained with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation dataset. To define the search space, the paper introduces a generalized GNN framework with sampling functions, correlation functions, aggregation functions, etc that the controller can select from. 

To make the search process efficient, GraphNAS employs parameter sharing among child models and a new strategy to determine when and how to share parameters. It also uses training of child models to obtain more precise rewards. Experiments demonstrate GraphNAS can design novel architectures that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on node classification tasks in transductive and inductive settings on citation networks and protein-protein interaction datasets.

In summary, GraphNAS automates GNN architecture design using neural architecture search with reinforcement learning and outperforms existing manually designed and other automatically searched architectures. The code is available to facilitate comparisons with future methods.
