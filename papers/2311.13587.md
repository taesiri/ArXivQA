## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's conclusion, the authors suggest exploring the following future research direction:

Incorporating deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict the timing of incoming user requests. As stated in the paper, "Looking to the future, one promising direction is the incorporation of deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict the time of incoming user requests. The ability to forecast when a specific user is likely to require request processing could revolutionize the way model transfers to GPUs are managed."

The authors argue that by using deep RNNs to predict user request patterns, the system could initiate the transfer of models to the GPU ahead of time and have them ready right when a request comes in. This would minimize the idle waiting times associated with loading models into GPU memory.

So in summary, the main future direction suggested is using deep learning models for request time prediction to optimize model loading and enhance the efficiency of serverless machine learning inference systems.
