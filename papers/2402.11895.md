# [Bridging or Breaking: Impact of Intergroup Interactions on Religious   Polarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper examines the impact of intergroup interactions on religious polarization on social media between majority Hindu and minority Muslim groups in India, in the context of major events during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Specifically, it investigates whether these interactions serve to mitigate polarization by promoting understanding, or exacerbate it due to factors like communal tensions. 

Proposed Solution
The paper proposes a novel metric called Group Conformity Score (GCS) to quantify an individual user's conformity to their religious group based on the semantic similarity of their tweets to the tweets of other users from their own and the other religious group. A higher GCS indicates greater polarization. The paper then uses a meta-learning model to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effect of intergroup interactions on changes in user's GCS around different events.

Key Findings
- Intergroup interactions generally reduce polarization (lower GCS), except for communal events where they increase GCS for the minority group.
- The decline in GCS is weaker for users with already high conformity to their group. 
- For political events, intergroup interactions increase polarization for users engaged in political discussions.
- Differences in treatment effects across groups are explained by differential impacts on emotions like anger/joy and topics like politics and socio-economics.

Main Contributions
- Novel GCS metric using contextualized embeddings to quantify linguistic polarization 
- Granular analysis of intergroup interaction effects using meta-learner framework
- Event-based analysis capturing sensitivity of religious polarization to real-world developments
- Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of differential impacts across groups

The paper provides nuanced, data-driven insights into the dynamics of online religious polarization and role of intergroup contact. The proposed analysis framework is generalizable to other contexts involving identity-based divides.
