## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Automated Continual Learning (ACL), a novel approach for training neural networks to learn continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. ACL formulates continual learning as a sequence processing task across long time lags and trains self-referential neural networks to meta-learn their own in-context continual learning algorithms through gradient descent. The ACL objective function encodes desiderata for continual learning, such as preserving past knowledge and enabling forward/backward transfer between tasks. Once trained, the networks run their learned algorithms autonomously without human intervention to address challenges like the stability-plasticity dilemma. Experiments demonstrate ACL's effectiveness; ACL-learned algorithms avoid "in-context catastrophic forgetting" and outperform hand-crafted methods on split-MNIST and other multi-dataset benchmarks. While directly scaling ACL remains challenging due to the need for long training sequences, the principle shows promise for automating development of continual learning algorithms. Key strengths are the learned algorithms' autonomy and general applicability, while limitations include scaling and task/model specificity. Overall, ACL offers a novel and promising approach to automated lifelong learning in neural networks.
