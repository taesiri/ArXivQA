# [ULMA: Unified Language Model Alignment with Demonstration and Point-wise   Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02554)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a draft high-quality summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two new methods for language model alignment: point-wise Direct Preference Optimization (point-wise DPO) and Unified Language Model Alignment (ULMA). They tackle limitations of previous alignment methods when dealing with point-wise preference datasets containing absolute feedback scores rather than pairwise preferences. 

The point-wise DPO extends the existing DPO method to directly handle point-wise datasets with either binary or continuous labels. This avoids the information loss incurred from transforming such datasets into a pairwise format. Experiments show point-wise DPO improves over RLHF baseline methods on point-wise preference tasks.

ULMA unifies instruction learning using demonstration data and point-wise preference learning in a single optimization framework. It treats positive and negative samples differently - maximizing log-likelihood for positive samples while applying a KL regularizer only on negative samples. This aims to better exploit high-quality positives while controlling undesirable generation.

Experiments across multiple alignment datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency for both proposed methods. They also contribute a new higher-quality demonstration dataset called Golden HH. The code and data have been released to facilitate research in language model alignment.
