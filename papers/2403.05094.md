# [Face2Diffusion for Fast and Editable Face Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05094)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Face2Diffusion for Fast and Editable Face Personalization":

Problem:
Previous text-to-image diffusion models struggle to preserve both identity similarity and editability when inserting new face images into the models. This is due to overfitting to the training samples, resulting in generated images having similar backgrounds, camera poses, and facial expressions as the input images. 

Proposed Solution (Face2Diffusion):
The key idea is to remove identity-irrelevant information from the training pipeline to prevent overfitting and improve editability of encoded faces. The proposed Face2Diffusion method consists of:

1) Multi-Scale Identity (MSID) Encoder: Provides well-disentangled identity features by encouraging shallower layers of a face recognition model to also discriminate identities, not just the deepest layer. This retains benefits of multi-scale features while preventing overfitting.

2) Expression Guidance: Disentangles facial expressions from identities by utilizing a separate 3D face reconstruction model to extract expression features. This improves controllability of facial expressions.

3) Class-Guided Denoising Regularization (CGDR): Encourages model to learn how faces should be denoised in the same manner as the super-class word "a person", improving text-alignment of backgrounds.

Main Contributions:
- Novel MSID encoder to disentangle camera poses from identities.
- Expression guidance to control facial expressions separate from identities. 
- CGDR to force face denoising process to match that of super-class, improving background text-alignment.

Experiments show Face2Diffusion greatly improves the trade-off between identity fidelity and text fidelity compared to 9 state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on 100 test faces over 40 text prompts.
