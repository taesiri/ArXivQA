# [Domain-Guided Masked Autoencoders for Unique Player Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11328)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Unique player identification in sports videos is challenging due to motion blur, occlusions, and low resolution resulting from fast movements of players and cameras. Existing methods rely on convolutional neural networks which struggle to handle these issues. Recently, masked autoencoders (MAEs) have shown promise for robust feature extraction but simply zero out random patches without considering domain-specific artifacts like motion blur common in sports. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a spatio-temporal network with a novel domain-guided MAE (\textit{d}-MAE) tailored for sports videos. Instead of zeroing out patches, \textit{d}-MAE introduces motion blur on random patches during pre-training to make the model robust to blur in sports data. The spatial features from \textit{d}-MAE are fed to a temporal transformer decoder to capture temporal cues across keyframes. The paper also refines the keyframe identification (KfID) module from prior work to better localize jersey numbers and uses keyframe fusion to augment limited labeled data.

Main Contributions:

- Novel \textit{d}-MAE with domain-guided masking strategy specifically designed to handle motion blur for player identification
- Spatio-temporal network combining \textit{d}-MAE and transformer decoder for jersey number recognition 
- Refinements to KfID module for better digit localization and semantic feature extraction
- Keyframe fusion technique to enrich training data
- State-of-the-art results on 3 large sports datasets - SoccerNet, ice hockey and baseball with gains of 8.58%, 4.29% and 1.2% over prior art
- Ablations validate contributions of domain-guided masking and improved KfID module

The summary covers the key problem being solved, the proposed domain-guided MAE approach and spatio-temporal network architecture, refinements to existing methods, and quantitive results showing state-of-the-art performance and ablative gains.
