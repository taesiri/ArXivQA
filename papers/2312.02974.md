# [Describing Differences in Image Sets with Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02974)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the task of Set Difference Captioning (SDC), which aims to describe salient differences between two sets of images using natural language. The authors propose a two-stage framework called VisDiff to address this, consisting of a "proposer" that suggests candidate difference descriptions based on sampled image captions, and a "ranker" that selects the best descriptions using CLIP embeddings. They introduce VisDiffBench, a dataset of 187 paired image sets with ground truth differences, to evaluate VisDiff. Experiments show that combining a GPT-4 proposer on BLIP-2 captions with a CLIP feature-based ranker works best, accurately identifying differences 61-80\% of the time. The versatility of VisDiff is demonstrated through applications comparing ImageNet and ImageNetV2, analyzing model behaviors, understanding generative models, and discovering memorable images. Results surface known and previously unknown insights, indicating VisDiff's utility for dataset analysis, model interpretation, and scientific discovery. Limitations include caption information loss, CLIP biases, language model inconsistencies, and reliance on large foundation models. Nonetheless, this work underscores the viability of automatic, interpretable image set analysis.
