# [PaperWeaver: Enriching Topical Paper Alerts by Contextualizing   Recommended Papers with User-collected Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02939)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: Academic researchers struggle with information overload from rapid growth of scholarly literature. Existing paper recommender systems provide alerts to help researchers discover relevant new papers, but they typically only show titles and abstracts which lacks contextual details on precisely why and how new papers connect to a researcher's interests. This makes it difficult for researchers to efficiently triage recommendations.

Method: The paper presents PaperWeaver, an enriched paper alert interface. It generates two types of contextualized text descriptions relating recommended papers to (1) a user's topical research interests inferred from their collected papers and (2) specific previously collected papers. Descriptions summarize problems, methods, findings of recommended papers relevant to user interests and describe relationships to collected papers.  

Contributions: PaperWeaver contributes a large language model approach tailored for academia to generate contextualized explanations connecting recommended papers to user context. A 15-person user study shows PaperWeaver helps researchers better understand relevance, efficiently triage recommendations, and uncovers useful relationships between new and existing papers compared to enriched baselines. The interface facilitates discovering relevant papers and updating understanding of literature.

In summary, the key highlight is PaperWeaver's ability to generate customized explanations for recommended papers that effectively bridge connections to a researcher's existing personal context to address information overload challenges. The tailored descriptive summaries and contrastive relationships help researchers make sense of new literature more efficiently.
