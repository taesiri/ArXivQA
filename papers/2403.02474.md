# [The Emotion Dynamics of Literary Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02474)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior computational analysis of emotions in novels has typically treated the entire text as a single arc, glossing over differences between characters. 
- The emotional journeys of different characters are central to a story's appeal, but have rarely been examined.

Objectives:
- Distinguish emotion arcs of narration vs dialogue and those of individual characters using the Project Dialogism Novel Corpus (PDNC). 
- Analyze longitudinal patterns of characters' emotional states over the course of novels using metrics of Utterance Emotion Dynamics (UED).
- Examine research questions around:
  * Emotion dynamics from start to end of novels
  * Differences between narration and dialogue arcs
  * Diversity of characters' emotion arcs within and across novels
  * Effects of gender on emotion arcs

Methods:
- Use PDNC dataset which has dialogue mapped to speakers in 28 English novels.
- Categorize speaker types: narration, major characters, minor characters.  
- Compute UED metrics like mean emotion, variability, displacement lengths and rates.
- Compare emotion arcs using correlation after alignment.

Key Findings:
- Emotions in narration vs dialogue are very different (near 0 correlation).  
- Characters show more variation in emotion metrics than meta-speakers.
- Valence is higher and arousal lower in character dialogues.
- Character emotion arcs have near 0 average correlation but high diversity.
- Female authors write higher valence for characters than male authors.

Contributions:
- First computational examination of longitudinal emotion patterns of literary characters.
- Demonstrates importance of distinguishing characters for understanding novels.
- Provides metrics to quantify emotion arc diversity across and within stories.
- Data and code publicly released.

The summary covers the key details on the problem being addressed, the nature of the analysis done to examine variations in character emotion arcs, the findings from the different experiments, and the main contributions made regarding analysis of emotions in literary texts.
