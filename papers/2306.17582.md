## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper introduces a novel framework for utilizing ChatGPT for robotics applications. Other works have explored using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and Codex for robotics, but they operate primarily in an open-loop manner with rigid prompting functions. This paper focuses on leveraging ChatGPT's conversational abilities for more flexible human-robot interaction.

- The paper provides a set of principles for prompt engineering when applying ChatGPT to robotics problems. This includes guidelines like creating descriptive API libraries and biasing answer structure. Other works using LLMs for robotics employ prompting strategies, but this paper collects a comprehensive set of techniques. 

- The paper evaluates ChatGPT across a diverse range of robotics domains including aerial systems, manipulation, and embodied navigation. Most prior works using LLMs for robotics focus on a single application area. This paper demonstrates the versatility of ChatGPT across subfields.

- For complex tasks, the paper advocates a user-in-the-loop approach to provide natural language feedback to ChatGPT for corrections. This enables intuitive refinement of behaviors. Other LLM works are primarily open-loop without this level of interactivity.

- The paper introduces an open source tool, PromptCraft, for collaborative development of prompting strategies. This aims to support the empirical science of prompt engineering. Other LLM robotics papers have not focused on building community knowledge.

In summary, while other papers have explored LLMs for robotics, this work provides a more comprehensive framework leveraging ChatGPT's conversational capabilities. The principles, evaluations across subfields, interactive refinement, and open tool aim to push the boundaries of human-robot interaction with LLMs.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a Perception-Action Causal Transformer (PACT) for pre-training policies for robotics. The key ideas are to model the robot environment as a Markov Decision Process, and leverage the self-attention capabilities of transformer models. The model takes as input perception observations and predicts actions through a causal masking approach. This allows the model to implicitly uncover correlations between actions and future states. The model is pre-trained in an unsupervised self-supervised manner by minimizing the error between predicted and ground truth action sequences collected from an autonomous driver. Once pre-trained, the feature extractor trunk can be transferred to multiple downstream tasks by re-training just a small task-specific head. Experiments on indoor navigation and autonomous driving demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-trained features, with metric improvements over training from scratch and other baseline methods. The model also showed an improved sample efficiency, achieving the same performance as other methods with 8x less real-world data.
