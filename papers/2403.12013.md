## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "GeoWizard: Unleashing the Diffusion Priors for 3D Geometry Estimation from a Single Image":

Problem:
Estimating 3D geometry (depth and surface normals) from a single image is an important but challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity in reversing the image formation process. Prior works using discriminative models (CNNs, Transformers) are limited by low diversity and poor quality of public datasets, struggling to generalize or capture intricate geometric details. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes GeoWizard, a generative foundation model for joint depth and normal estimation that leverages diffusion priors. Key ideas:

1) Jointly estimate depth and normals in a unified framework using a geometry switcher, allowing mutual information exchange and consistency. 

2) Propose scene distribution decoupler to segregate the complex data distribution into distinct sub-distributions (outdoor, indoor, objects) and avoid geometry estimation ambiguities.

3) Fine-tune a single stable diffusion model to predict depth and normals, utilizing its strong natural image priors learned from billions of images.

Main Contributions:

1) GeoWizard sets new state-of-the-art in zero-shot depth and normal prediction, significantly improving generalization and detail preservation.

2) Simple yet effective scene distribution decoupler enables distinguishing spatial layouts of different scenes, capturing geometry with remarkable fidelity.

3) Leveraging diffusion priors instead of scaling up data/computation marks an innovative direction for ill-posed vision problems.

4) Estimated depth and normals enhance downstream applications like 3D reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and 2D content generation.

In summary, GeoWizard is the first work to unleash diffusion priors for monocular 3D geometry estimation, achieving robust and detailed depth and normals to benefit various applications. The proposed ideas of joint modeling and distribution decoupling set strong baselines for future generative geometry estimation models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

GeoWizard is an innovative generative foundation model for jointly estimating high-quality depth and surface normal maps from monocular images by extending stable diffusion models, using a geometry switcher for joint modeling and a scene distribution decoupler to handle layout ambiguities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents GeoWizard, a new generative foundation model for jointly estimating depth and surface normals from single images. GeoWizard faithfully captures intricate geometric details.

2. It proposes a simple yet effective "scene distribution decoupler" strategy to guide the diffusion model to avoid ambiguities that may lead to conflating distinct scene layouts during geometry estimation. This enables the model to recognize different scene types and capture their 3D geometry with high fidelity.

3. GeoWizard achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot depth and normal prediction on several benchmarks, significantly enhancing downstream applications like 3D reconstruction, 2D content creation, and novel viewpoint synthesis.

In summary, the key innovation is using diffusion models and the proposed strategies to unleash their potential for high-quality monocular geometry estimation, with applications to various 3D tasks. GeoWizard sets new state-of-the-art results for this problem.
