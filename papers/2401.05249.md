# [CASA: Causality-driven Argument Sufficiency Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Assessing whether the premises of an argument sufficiently support its conclusion is an important capability for identifying the quality of arguments. However, existing approaches rely on inconsistent human annotations due to the subjective criteria of sufficiency. This makes it challenging to train an accurate assessment model.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes CASA, a zero-shot causality-driven argument sufficiency assessment framework. CASA formulates the assessment task based on the probability of sufficiency (PS) definition from causality literature. Specifically, PS measures how likely introducing the premise event would lead to the conclusion event, when both events are originally absent. 

To estimate PS, CASA leverages the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in two key steps:
1) Context sampling: CASA instructs LLMs to generate contexts that are inconsistent with both the premise and conclusion. This acts as the observational data where premise and conclusion events are absent.
2) Revision under intervention: CASA asks LLMs to revise the contexts by intervening to inject the premise event. The effect of this intervention on the conclusion is used to estimate PS.

An NLI model is further utilized to transform the probability estimation into natural language inference for each context. The overall PS is aggregated from individual contexts.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes CASA, a theoretically grounded framework for argument sufficiency assessment based on the probability of sufficiency 
- Demonstrates using LLMs to generate textual data samples and make interventions for realizing the probability estimation
- Evaluates CASA on two logical fallacy detection datasets and shows superior performance over strong baselines
- Applies CASA to provide writing suggestions by generating objection situations, and shows improved argument sufficiency in student essays

The key novelty lies in the unique causality-driven formulation and the capability to operationalize it with recent advances in LLMs. Experiments prove CASA's effectiveness on both argument quality assessment and providing constructive writing assistance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes CASA, a zero-shot argument sufficiency assessment framework that leverages causal reasoning and large language models to estimate the probability of an argument's premises sufficiently supporting its conclusion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors design \textsc{Casa}, a theoretically grounded framework for argument sufficiency assessment based on the probability of sufficiency concept from causality research. 

2) To realize the probability of sufficiency calculation, the authors exploit large language models (LLMs) to generate textual data samples and conduct interventions on them. They demonstrate the effectiveness of using LLMs for these tasks through experiments on logical fallacy detection.

3) The authors demonstrate a practical application of \textsc{Casa} in improving the sufficiency of arguments in student-written essays by generating objection situations and suggestions for revision.

The paper proposes CASA, a causality-driven argument sufficiency assessment framework, that aims to determine if the premises of an argument support its conclusion. It uses the probability of sufficiency concept from causal literature and large language models to sample contexts and make interventions to estimate this probability. Experiments are conducted on logical fallacy detection datasets. The framework is also applied to provide writing suggestions to improve argument sufficiency in student essays. So the key terms reflect this overall focus and approach of the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does CASA formulate the argument sufficiency assessment task in terms of the probability of sufficiency (PS) from the causal literature? What are the key assumptions made in this formulation?

2. What are the main challenges in estimating the probability of sufficiency and how does CASA address them? Explain the role of large language models in generating observational data and conducting interventions. 

3. Explain the context sampling step in detail. What is the motivation behind decomposing the context into confounders and mediators? How does this align with the framework's causal assumptions?

4. Walk through the revision under intervention step. What is the purpose of making interventions on the generated contexts? How does CASA ensure the interventions meet the consistency assumption?

5. The paper discusses dealing with arguments that have multiple premises. Explain how CASA exhaustively checks the sufficiency of each premise and how the context sampling is adapted for this.

6. What is the motivation behind using logical fallacy detection datasets for evaluation instead of existing argument sufficiency datasets? What are the key differences between these datasets?

7. Analyze and critique the various baseline methods compared against CASA. What are their limitations in assessing argument sufficiency? 

8. Discuss the step-wise human evaluation conducted and what it reveals about the capabilities of LLMs. What are some common errors found and how might they be addressed?

9. Explain the writing assistance application using CASA. How are the objection situations generated and converted into practical suggestions? What do the human evaluation results show?

10. What are some limitations of CASA discussed in the paper? What choices were made in the model design and evaluation? How might these be addressed in future work?
