# [VIGFace: Virtual Identity Generation Model for Face Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08277)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Deep learning-based face recognition (FR) models rely on large datasets of face images crawled from the internet. However, gathering such datasets raises significant privacy concerns and issues like portrait rights. Existing synthetic face datasets have limitations in quality, diversity of identities, and consistency. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes VIGFace, a novel framework to generate synthetic face images of virtual identities. It has two main stages:

1. Train a FR model on real images to extract ID embeddings. Simultaneously assign positions for real and virtual ID prototypes in the feature space. Virtual prototypes are optimized to be orthogonal to real prototypes.

2. Use a diffusion model conditioned on ID embeddings to generate synthetic images. The model is trained to minimize the feature distance between real and synthetic images. Classifier-free guidance is used to balance identity consistency and diversity.

Main Contributions:

1. VIGFace generates realistic and diverse synthetic faces of virtual identities that are clearly separated from real individuals. This alleviates privacy concerns with real face datasets.

2. Experiments show VIGFace narrows the performance gap with models trained on real datasets to 1.6%, demonstrating its efficacy as a virtual dataset.

3. When combined with real data, VIGFace enhances model performance by 1.12% over real data alone. This shows its capabilities as an augmentation technique.

In summary, VIGFace produces high-quality and privacy-preserving synthetic facial images that can act as an alternative to real datasets. It also boosts model performance when used alongside real data. The virtual identities guarantee no overlap with real people.
