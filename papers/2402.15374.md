# [Outlier detection by ensembling uncertainty with negative objectness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of outlier or anomaly detection in computer vision models. Outliers are test examples that deviate significantly from the training data distribution. Detecting such outliers enables graceful performance degradation by allowing the model to decline predictions on unknown concepts. Many existing methods rely on encouraging low confidence predictions on negative training data, which can bias towards certain types of outliers.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel anomaly score called "ensemble of Uncertainty and Negative Objectness" (UNO). Instead of a standard K-way classifier on inlier classes, they train a K+1-way classifier, with the additional (K+1)-th class modeling outliers. This allows directly predicting outlier examples instead of just encouraging low confidence. 

The UNO anomaly score ensembles two components: 
1) In-distribution uncertainty score based on negative max softmax probability over K inlier classes 
2) Negative objectness score defined as posterior probability of the (K+1)-th outlier class

By combining uncertain inlier predictions with outlier similarity, UNO can detect dissimilar outliers missed by other methods.

For pixel-level outlier detection, UNO is embedded into a Mask2Former architecture for segmentation. The (K+2)-th mask class learns negative objectness on pasted outliers. UNO applied on mask embeddings gives mask-wise outlier scores, propagated to pixels based on assignments.

Contributions:

- Novel UNO anomaly score ensembling inlier uncertainty and negative objectness for detecting dissimilar outliers
- K+1 classification setup allows directly predicting outliers instead of just low confidence
- State-of-the-art performance on image and pixel-level outlier benchmarks, with and without real negative data
- Analysis shows UNO components are uncorrelated, explaining performance gains from ensembling
- Qualitative examples demonstrate different failure modes addressed by the ensemble

In summary, the paper presents a way to improve outlier detection by modeling outliers explicitly rather than just encouraging uncertainty. The proposed UNO score combines complementary cues in an ensemble, advancing state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.
