# [Understanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the   Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03268)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to understand the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) that emerge from pre-training with a next-token prediction objective. Specifically, it tries to explain how pre-training enables LLMs to perform logical reasoning over knowledge graphs and math reasoning for solving word problems, without explicit fine-tuning.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper hypothesizes that LLMs aggregate reasoning paths seen during pre-training to derive new conclusions at test time. More formally, it models reasoning paths as random walks over a knowledge or reasoning graph, with nodes representing concepts/reasoning states and edges representing arguments connecting them. 

It proposes that the LLM distribution at test time can be viewed as a weighted sum of the probabilities of relevant random walk paths seen during training. Experiments verify this on knowledge graph and math word problem reasoning tasks.

Key Contributions:
- Formalizes a hypothesis that views LLM reasoning as weighted aggregation of random walk reasoning paths seen during pre-training.

- Analyzes KL divergence between LLM distributions and aggregated random walk path probabilities on knowledge graph reasoning. Shows LM assigns logic rule importance akin to classic path ranking algorithms.

- Shows pre-training from scratch on knowledge graph random walks enables logical reasoning on unseen graphs. Analyzes effect of random walk path length.

- Proposes continuing pre-training on unlabeled random walk reasoning paths generated from existing math reasoning datasets. Shows consistent gains over supervised fine-tuning across 3 math word problem datasets.

- Reveals optimal random walk path lengths related to intrinsic reasoning requirements of different tasks. Supports key hypothesis on reasoning via paths aggregation.

In summary, the paper provides a reasoning paths aggregation view to understand and improve emergence of reasoning in LLMs. The analysis and experiments support the hypothesis and highlight principles for constructing pre-training data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes that language models gain reasoning ability through pre-training by aggregating indirect reasoning paths connecting concepts, which enables them to make novel inferences at test time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and providing evidence for the hypothesis that language models (LMs) gain reasoning abilities through aggregating reasoning paths seen during pre-training. Specifically:

1) The paper formalizes reasoning paths as random walks on knowledge/reasoning graphs and shows both theoretically and empirically that LM distributions can be explained as weighted aggregations over these random walk reasoning paths.

2) Experiments on knowledge graph reasoning and math word problem solving demonstrate that pre-training LMs on unlabeled random walk reasoning paths consistently improves reasoning performance on downstream tasks. 

3) The analysis provides insights into how properties of the pre-training data, such as reasoning path lengths, affect the reasoning abilities acquired by LMs. It also suggests principles for constructing or augmenting pre-training data to better enable reasoning.

In summary, the key contribution is the reasoning paths aggregation hypothesis along with the supporting evidence showing this perspective is effective for understanding and improving LMs' reasoning capacities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that language models (LMs) gain reasoning ability by aggregating reasoning paths seen during pre-training. What are some potential limitations of this hypothesis? For example, could there be other factors that contribute to reasoning ability? 

2. The paper focuses on logical reasoning and math reasoning as two case studies. What other types of reasoning could this aggregation hypothesis potentially explain or not explain? For example, what about common sense reasoning?

3. For knowledge graph (KG) reasoning, the paper defines reasoning paths as random walks on the KG. What are some potential issues with using random walks to model logical reasoning paths? Could more structured paths be more appropriate in some cases?

4. The paper trains LMs from scratch on KG random walk paths. What effect would using a pre-trained LM have on the results? Would transfer learning from language modeling still benefit logical reasoning on this simplified KG setting?

5. For math reasoning, the paper constructs a latent reasoning graph from existing chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. What other ways could this reasoning graph be constructed if CoT solutions are not available? 

6. The optimal length of random walk reasoning paths is shown to impact reasoning performance. What underlying factors might determine this optimal length for different reasoning tasks?

7. The paper emphasizes unlabeled random walk paths for pre-training. What effect would having annotated reasoning paths have? Could incorporating annotations further improve reasoning performance?

8. What types of biases could be introduced or perpetuated by using unlabeled reasoning paths from predominantly Western text corpora for pre-training? How could this be addressed?

9. The random walk approach focuses on local graph structure. What global properties of the reasoning graph could also impact the effectiveness of pre-training for reasoning?

10. The paper hypothesizes reasoning ability emerges from pre-training objectives. What architectural properties of transformers could also contribute to their strong reasoning capacity?
