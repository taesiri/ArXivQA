# [A Generalist Dynamics Model for Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10912)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is whether transformer sequence models can be effectively used as dynamics models for control tasks, and demonstrate strong generalization capabilities to unseen environments. Specifically, the paper investigates two key aspects:1) Whether transformer dynamics models (TDMs) can serve as accurate single-environment specialist models when trained on sufficient data from the target environment. 2) Whether TDMs exhibit strong generalization capabilities to unseen environments, both in a few-shot setting where a generalist model is fine-tuned on the new environment, and in a zero-shot setting where the generalist model is directly applied.The central hypothesis appears to be that transformer sequence models are well suited for learning dynamical models that can generalize effectively, enabling powerful model-based control agents. The experiments aim to demonstrate the capabilities of TDMs as specialist models, as well as their generalization abilities in few-shot and zero-shot settings.Overall, the paper presents TDMs as a promising approach for developing generalist control agents that can leverage prior experience and quickly adapt to new environments. Evaluating the generalization performance is a key focus.
