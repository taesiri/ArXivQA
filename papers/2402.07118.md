# [Next-Generation Teleophthalmology: AI-enabled Quality Assessment Aiding   Remote Smartphone-based Consultation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Blindness and eye diseases are a major global health issue, especially in developing countries like India. Access to quality eye care is limited in rural areas. 
- Smartphone-based teleophthalmology using attachments like Grabi has emerged as an effective solution, enabling patient self-capture of eye images and remote diagnosis. However, image quality is often inadequate, requiring clinician vetting and delays.

Proposed Solution:  
- Develop an AI system to automatically assess quality of patient-captured eye images, providing instant feedback to retake poor quality images. This will reduce load on clinicians and delays.
- Break down the complex quality assessment task hierarchically into tiers:
    - Tier 1: Detect presence of eye 
    - Tier 2: Assess lighting/illumination
    - Tier 3: Evaluate resolution, completeness of cornea region, focus sharpness 
- Presently tackle Tier 1 and 2. Develop customized CNN architectures for each tier. Arrange detectors hierarchically, like clinician logic.

Experiments and Results:
- Curated datasets with expert labeling for presence of eye and lighting quality. 
- Tested ResNet variants for presence of eye detector. Training all layers performs better than only last layer.
- Tested ResNet variants with and without wavelet transform for lighting detector. No transform works better.
- Strong end-to-end classification performance in hierarchical testing on specialized test set. System accurately flags low quality images.

Key Contributions:
- Novel idea of AI-based quality assessment of patient eye images to aid teleophthalmology. 
- Hierarchical approach mimicking clinician logic, presently implementing two initial tiers of assessment.
- Custom datasets created and strong proof-of-concept experimental results presented.

The summary covers the key details on the problem being addressed, the proposed hierarchical AI solution and its current implementation status, the experiments performed along with results, and the primary contributions made in this preliminary study.
