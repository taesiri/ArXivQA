## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ClusterDDPM, a novel expectation-maximization (EM) framework for image clustering using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). DDPMs have shown superior image generation capabilities compared to VAEs and GANs, but their potential for clustering remains unexplored. The key idea is to alternate between learning a mixture of Gaussians prior over the latent space in the E-step, and then training a conditional DDPM to match this prior in the M-step. Specifically, in the E-step, latent codes are extracted and grouped via Gaussian mixture modeling. In the M-step, the conditional DDPM is trained to map images to latent codes following the Gaussian mixture prior using a noise prediction loss and distribution matching loss. Theoretical analysis shows the M-step optimization is equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the log-likelihood. Experiments on four image datasets demonstrate ClusterDDPM's advantages, including improved clustering performance, higher-quality conditional image generation, and more discriminative latent feature learning compared to state-of-the-art VAE and GAN clustering methods. Key strengths are exploiting DDPMs for clustering and the iterative latent space grouping and matching procedure.
