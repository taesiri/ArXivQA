# [Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01714)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we design an effective prompting approach to guide large language models to engage in more structured and logical reasoning when tackling complex problem-solving tasks?

More specifically, the key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Prompting large language models to self-generate relevant examples and reasoning steps (in an "analogical reasoning" style) will enhance their reasoning and problem-solving abilities compared to more generic prompting approaches. 

2) This self-generation of tailored examples and reasoning chains will outperform manually providing fixed examples, since it can tailor the guidance to each specific problem.

3) Self-generating high-level knowledge alongside specific examples can further improve reasoning, especially for very complex tasks.

The paper aims to test these hypotheses through empirical experiments on mathematical problem solving, code generation, and logical reasoning datasets. The core proposal is a new prompting approach called "analogical prompting" that makes language models self-generate relevant examples and knowledge before solving a given problem. The key research questions revolve around whether this approach can enhance reasoning and outperform baseline prompting techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be introducing a new prompting approach called "analogical prompting" to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). 

Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:

- Prompting LLMs to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge before solving a new problem. This is inspired by how humans perform analogical reasoning - drawing from relevant past experiences when tackling new problems.

- The exemplars or knowledge are generated on the fly for each specific problem, eliminating the need for manually labeled data. This makes the approach more convenient and widely applicable compared to few-shot prompting with fixed exemplars.

- The self-generated exemplars and knowledge are tailored to the given problem, providing more relevant guidance compared to completely generic prompts. 

- Two techniques are proposed: self-generating just exemplars, and self-generating both knowledge and exemplars. The knowledge provides high-level insights to complement specific exemplars.

- Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks (math, code generation, logical reasoning etc.) show accuracy gains over baselines like 0-shot and few-shot prompting.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and evaluating an analogical prompting approach that makes LLMs self-generate tailored reasoning guidance, eliminating the need for manual labeling while enhancing performance across reasoning tasks. This offers a convenient and effective way to harness LLMs for complex reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces analogical prompting, a new method for prompting large language models to self-generate relevant exemplars and knowledge to guide their reasoning process when solving problems, outperforming standard prompting techniques across mathematical, code generation, and logical reasoning tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new method for prompting large language models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning and problem-solving abilities. The key idea is to prompt LLMs to self-generate relevant exemplars and knowledge before solving a given problem, inspired by analogical reasoning in humans. Here are some key comparisons to other related works:

1. Compared to standard chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques like 0-shot CoT and few-shot CoT, this work eliminates the need to provide labeled reasoning exemplars for each task. Instead, it makes LLMs self-generate relevant exemplars, tailored to individual problems. This offers more customized guidance to aid LLM reasoning. Empirically, the proposed analogical prompting method outperforms 0-shot and few-shot CoT on diverse reasoning tasks.

2. Compared to recent works on retrieval-augmented CoT prompting, which retrieve relevant exemplars from external data, this work focuses on self-generating exemplars within the prompt context. The advantage of self-generation is convenience, as it does not require external data retrieval. However, retrieved exemplars may be more reliable, while generated ones lack guarantees. The paper shows both approaches have tradeoffs - self-generation excels with larger LLMs, while retrieval is better for smaller LLMs.

3. For code generation specifically, this work additionally prompts LLMs to generate high-level knowledge alongside exemplars. This provides useful algorithmic insights that complement the low-level exemplars. Some prior works have also incorporated external knowledge into CoT, but this work makes LLMs self-generate such knowledge.

4. Compared to prior works that train or fine-tune LLMs to improve reasoning, this work focuses on more convenient prompting-based methods that do not require model training. However, training may yield more robust and generalizable reasoning abilities.

Overall, the idea of self-generating exemplars and knowledge to guide LLM reasoning is novel and outperforms prior prompting baselines. The tradeoffs compared to other techniques like retrieval and training warrant further investigation. The analogical reasoning inspiration offers a promising new direction for enhancing LLM reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising directions for future research:

- Develop methods to generate exemplars that not only possess relevance but also facilitate generalization to new problems. In the error analysis, the authors found cases where the model failed to solve new problems due to a generalization gap from the exemplars. New techniques could produce exemplars tailored to promoting generalization.

- Examine integrating analogical prompting with other methods like self-consistency, least-to-most prompting, and tools/programs to further enhance reasoning. The analogical prompting approach is complementary and could combine well with these other efforts. 

- Analyze the intermediate reasoning steps produced by models to detect biases, errors, and safety issues. The authors highlight the importance of interpreting and debugging model-generated reasoning chains.

- Scale up analogical prompting to even larger language models, which may allow generating more useful exemplars and knowledge. The authors found their method performed better with larger model scale.

- Develop prompting methods that reduce computational costs, as analogical prompting generates more tokens. Techniques to make reasoning prompting more efficient could help offset these costs.

- Analyze prompt sensitivity, since specific wording can influence model performance. Testing various prompt formulations could reveal insights into how phrasing impacts reasoning quality.

- Apply analogical prompting to a broader range of domains like science QA, logical puzzles, strategy games, and creative tasks. Evaluating the approach on diverse reasoning tasks is an important direction.

In summary, the main future work involves strengthening exemplar quality, combining with other methods, analyzing reasoning, scaling up, improving efficiency, testing prompts, and expanding domains. Advancing analogical prompting along these dimensions can further unlock the reasoning potential of large language models.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method proposed in the paper is analogical prompting for large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to prompt the LLM to self-generate relevant exemplars and reasoning steps before solving a given problem. 

Specifically, when presented with a new problem to solve, the proposed approach first prompts the LLM to recall and provide a few examples of similar problems along with explanations of how they were solved. This is inspired by how humans perform analogical reasoning, drawing from relevant past experiences when tackling new challenges. After self-generating these exemplars, the LLM is then prompted to provide a step-by-step solution to the original problem. 

Compared to standard prompting approaches like zero-shot and few-shot prompting, analogical prompting offers more tailored guidance by making the LLM generate problem-specific examples. It also eliminates the need for manually labeled data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on mathematical problem solving, code generation, and logical reasoning tasks. Across tasks and base LLM models, analogical prompting outperforms baseline prompting techniques, offering both improved performance and more interpretable reasoning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose using analogical reasoning to guide large language models (LLMs) to solve problems by prompting them to self-generate relevant examples before tackling the main problem. How might this approach compare to other ways of priming LLMs, such as providing definitions, tutorials, or summaries of key concepts? What are the potential strengths and weaknesses of using analogical reasoning specifically?

2. When prompting the LLM to generate examples, the authors instruct it to provide "relevant and distinct" problems. What criteria do you think the LLM uses to determine relevance and distinctiveness? How might the prompt design impact the diversity and utility of the generated examples?

3. The method relies on the LLM's ability to self-generate useful examples based on its pre-training. When might this approach fail or struggle? For instance, how might the approach perform on novel tasks or domains the LLM has little exposure to during pre-training?

4. The authors find that generating knowledge/tutorials before examples leads to better performance on complex tasks like code generation. Why might this order be beneficial? Does prompting for abstract knowledge first help better direct the search for concrete examples?

5. When might generating exemplars be more effective than retrieving them from a database? When might retrieval be better? What are the tradeoffs between generation vs. retrieval of examples to prime the LLM?

6. How sensitive is the approach to the specific wording, style, and content of the prompt? For example, how important is explicitly instructing distinctness of examples? How might changes in prompt design impact results?

7. The approach improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks. Are there certain types of tasks or problems where you would expect this method to struggle? Why might analogical reasoning be ineffective for some problems?  

8. To what extent could the generated examples and knowledge be analyzed to provide insights into the LLM's reasoning process? Could this transparency be useful for debugging or improving the LLM?

9. How efficiently can this approach scale to long or multi-step problems? Does the cost of generating examples limit its applicability to short, simple problems?

10. The authors focus on in-context learning within a single prompt, but could the generated examples also be saved and re-used across prompts? Would building a collection of LLM-generated examples be a promising direction?
