# [DreamHuman: Animatable 3D Avatars from Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09329)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we generate realistic, animatable 3D human avatars from just textual descriptions, without any paired text-to-3D training data?

The key points are:

- The paper presents a method called DreamHuman to generate 3D human avatars from text prompts. 

- The goal is to create animated 3D models that match the textual description, with realistic appearance, clothing, and body shape.

- The key innovation is doing this without any supervised text-to-3D training data. 

- The method combines text-to-image diffusion models, neural radiance fields, and 3D statistical human body models.

- The human body model acts as a strong prior to regularize the avatar structure and appearance during optimization.

- This allows generating animatable avatars that can be reposited in new poses.

So in summary, the main research question is how to leverage recent advances in generative models to create controllable, animatable 3D human avatars from text alone, without paired text-to-3D supervision. The paper presents a novel approach and demonstrates high quality 3D human generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method called DreamHuman to generate realistic and animatable 3D human avatar models solely from textual descriptions. The key aspects are:

- DreamHuman combines large language models, neural radiance fields, and statistical human body models to generate 3D human avatars with realistic appearance, clothing, and body shapes from text prompts. 

- The method incorporates human body priors to regularize the avatar structure and ensure anthropometric consistency of complex structures like limbs and fingers. This helps avoid undesirable artifacts like missing limbs that general text-to-3D methods can produce.

- The avatars can be animated and placed in different poses based on a set of 3D poses or motions, without needing additional training or fine-tuning. This is enabled by modeling non-rigid, pose-dependent surface deformations.

- Semantic zooming is used to add detail in perceptually important regions like the face and hands by modifying the prompts and rendering higher resolution views of those areas.

- The method is trainable without any supervised text-to-3D data by relying on score distribution sampling losses from a text-to-image diffusion model.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel framework to generate realistic, animatable 3D human avatars from text through the combination of neural radiance fields, statistical body models, and advancements in text-to-image synthesis. The results significantly outperform prior work in 3D avatar generation.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in text-to-3D human generation:

- The main novelty of this paper is the generation of realistic, animatable 3D human avatars solely from text prompts, without any paired text-to-3D training data. This sets it apart from prior work like TeMoS, Teach, MoTo which rely on text-to-motion datasets.

- Compared to AvatarCLIP which also generates animatable avatars from text, this method produces much higher quality texture and geometry, especially for loose clothing. It handles clothing deformation and animation better during reposing.

- Using a human body model like GHUM allows incorporating strong priors about human shape and structure. This results in more anthropometrically consistent avatars compared to general text-to-3D methods like DreamFusion.

- The use of semantic zooming to focus on important body parts is novel and results in crisper details in the face, hands etc. 

- Relying on a conditional NeRF formulation makes the approach more flexible than methods based on template meshes like AvatarCLIP. The NeRF can model non-rigid deformations beyond the body model.

- Architecturally, connecting text-to-image diffusion models, NeRF scene representations and statistical body models is an interesting fusion that enables high quality 3D avatar generation.

- The method can generate a wider diversity of human models compared to video-based approaches like H-NeRF or HummaneRF that are limited to subjects and motions in the training data.

Overall, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in text-to-3D human generation through the novel model architecture and training strategy. The results showcase a leap in visual quality and controllability compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Leveraging 3D data to help resolve reconstruction ambiguities and improve the generation of fine surface details like wrinkles. The current method sometimes draws these details in the texture/albedo instead of the geometry. 

- Improving albedo and shading disentanglement to reduce baked-in reflections and shadows. 

- Scaling up the method to enable higher-resolution textures and finer geometric detail like hair. Currently, computational constraints from the diffusion models limit the achievable resolution.

- Incorporating video data into the model to improve clothing animation and pose-dependent deformations. The current model relies solely on text prompts.

- Addressing potential biases in the generative process stemming from the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. The authors suggest using more curated training data and models to mitigate this.

- Exploring ways to prevent potential misuse of the technology for generating fake content. The authors suggest input prompt filtering and detecting unsafe content.

- Leveraging the method's ability to generate diverse avatars to construct large-scale synthetic 3D human datasets that could train fairer models.

Overall, the authors identify several interesting research avenues to enhance the realism, controllability, and applicability of text-to-3D avatar generation. Combining multiple data modalities and carefully assessing broader impacts seem to be cross-cutting themes for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents DreamHuman, a method to generate realistic and animatable 3D human avatar models solely from textual descriptions. The method connects large text-to-image synthesis models, neural radiance fields, and statistical human body models in a novel modeling and optimization framework. This enables the generation of dynamic 3D human avatars with high-quality textures and learned, instance-specific surface deformations. The key components of the method are a deformable and pose-conditioned neural radiance field model learned using an implicit statistical 3D human model called imGHUM. The optimization of the avatar structure is guided by a text-to-image generator through a loss called Score Distillation Sampling. Additional losses enforce anthropometric consistency and coherence in the avatar synthesis process. The method can generate a wide variety of realistic animatable 3D human models from text, with diverse appearance, clothing, skin tones and body shapes. Experiments show the method significantly outperforms generic text-to-3D approaches and previous text-based 3D avatar generators in visual fidelity.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents DreamHuman, a method to generate realistic and animatable 3D human avatar models solely from textual descriptions. The key components of DreamHuman are large text-to-image synthesis models, neural radiance fields (NeRFs), and statistical human body models. These are combined in a novel modeling and optimization framework to generate dynamic 3D human avatars with high-quality textures and learned surface deformations specific to each instance. 

DreamHuman takes a text prompt as input, such as "a woman wearing a dress", and optimizes a NeRF model to match the description. The optimization uses guidance from a text-to-image diffusion model to ensure photorealism. Crucially, an implicit statistical human body model called imGHUM is incorporated to control the avatar structure and inject anthropometric priors. This resolves consistency issues that arise with generic text-to-3D methods, like unrealistic proportions or missing limbs. The animated avatars can be reposed at test time based on new motions. Experiments demonstrate DreamHuman produces diverse, realistic 3D humans from text, with state-of-the-art image quality and animation capabilities compared to previous avatar generators.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents DreamHuman, a method to generate realistic animatable 3D human avatar models solely from textual descriptions. The key components of the method are:

- A neural radiance field (NeRF) is used to represent the 3D scene. The NeRF is learned in the semantic signed distance space of the imGHUM implicit statistical human body model. This allows generating avatars that conform to realistic body shape and proportions. 

- The NeRF is conditioned on pose and shape parameters from imGHUM, which enables generating the avatar in different poses while modeling realistic clothing deformations.

- Score distillation sampling loss from a text-to-image diffusion model is used to optimize the NeRF to match the description. Additional losses enforce consistency with imGHUM body shape and coherence of surface normals and foreground mask.

- Semantic zooming is used during optimization to add detail to important body parts like the face and hands by modifying the text prompt and rendering higher resolution crops.

By combining these components, the method can generate high quality animatable 3D human avatars with realistic shape, appearance and clothing directly from text descriptions.
