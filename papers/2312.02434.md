# [FINER: Flexible spectral-bias tuning in Implicit NEural Representation   by Variable-periodic Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02434)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel implicit neural representation method called FINER that introduces variable-periodic activation functions to address the limited capacity of existing methods like SIREN. FINER utilizes more of the activation function's definition domain by modulating the bias initialization range. This allows selection of sub-functions with different frequencies along the full domain, significantly expanding the supported frequency set that can be represented. The authors prove FINER's superior capacity both geometrically and through neural tangent kernel analysis. They demonstrate that FINER provides stronger shift-invariance and captures higher frequencies than baseline methods. Extensive experiments on 2D image fitting, 3D shape representation, and 5D neural radiance field optimization substantiate FINER's state-of-the-art performance on representing both low and high frequency components of signals. Key innovations include the variable-periodic activation function and flexible spectral bias tuning through bias initialization. By enhancing frequency expressivity, FINER advances implicit neural representations across multiple application domains.
