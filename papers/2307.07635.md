# CoTracker: It is Better to Track Together

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether jointly tracking multiple points and modeling their correlations can improve long-term point tracking in videos. The key hypothesis is that modeling correlations between tracked points will lead to better tracking performance compared to tracking points independently.Specifically, the paper proposes a new neural network architecture called CoTracker that jointly tracks multiple points throughout a video while modeling correlations between their motions. This is in contrast to prior work like TAP-Vid and Particle Video Revisited that track points independently. The main hypothesis is that by tracking points jointly and exploiting correlations, CoTracker will achieve better performance on long-term point tracking benchmarks compared to methods that track points independently. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by evaluating CoTracker against prior state-of-the-art methods on several point tracking benchmark datasets.In summary, the key research question is whether modeling correlations between tracked points can improve long-term point tracking performance, with the main hypothesis being that a joint tracking method like CoTracker will outperform independent tracking baselines. The paper aims to demonstrate the value of joint modeling of correlations for point tracking through extensive experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing CoTracker, a novel neural network architecture for jointly tracking multiple points in videos. The key ideas are:- Combining insights from optical flow and point tracking literature to track multiple points jointly throughout a video. This allows exploiting correlations between points.- Using a transformer network operating on a 2D grid of tokens, with one dimension being time and the other being the set of tracked points. The transformer can update an initial estimate of the tracks incrementally to better match the video content.- Supporting tracking in long videos through a sliding window mechanism. The same architecture can track new points added at any time by initializing tracks trivially. - Training the model in an unrolled fashion on synthetic video data to handle long sequences.The main benefit is that by tracking points jointly and sharing information between them, CoTracker outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods for tracking individual points. It demonstrates significant improvements on several tracking benchmarks. The architecture is flexible as points can be initialized at any frame and tracked forward or backward in time.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in video motion estimation and tracking:- It proposes a new paradigm for joint tracking of multiple points throughout long videos. Most prior work has focused on either dense optical flow estimation between pairs of frames or independent tracking of points. Jointly tracking groups of points allows exploiting correlations and improves accuracy.- The method uses a transformer architecture operating on a spatio-temporal grid to iteratively refine tracks. This is a novel neural network design for the tracking problem. It draws inspiration from recent optical flow work using transformers like Flowformer.- Training uses a sliding window approach with overlapping windows to handle long videos. The training is unrolled over windows which is key to propagate information over long durations. This idea is adapted from recent video recognition models.- The method achieves state-of-the-art results on several tracking benchmarks including TAP-Vid, BADJA and FastCapture. The gains are particularly significant for the joint tracking of multiple correlated points.- Most prior work has focused on tracking visible points. This method also explicitly predicts point visibility and outperforms others in occlusion estimation metrics.- The transformer architecture allows adding new points to track at any time in a video. It also supports tracking variable numbers of points jointly. This flexibility is not found in other techniques.Overall, the paper introduces a novel tracking paradigm and architecture that outperforms prior work. The ability to jointly track groups of points exploiting their correlation seems to be a key advantage over independent tracking. The results demonstrate the benefits of this approach for long-term motion estimation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring different transformer architectures and attention mechanisms for joint point tracking. The authors use a simplified transformer with factorized time and group attention, but more complex designs could further improve performance.- Scaling up to dense tracking. The quadratic complexity of the transformer in the number of points makes dense tracking challenging. Developing efficient approximations or sparse attention mechanisms could help apply this approach to full dense tracking.- Incorporating semantic reasoning. The current method purely reasons about low-level motion cues. Incorporating high-level semantic understanding of the scene could improve robustness.- Leveraging additional modalities like depth or video priors. The method currently only uses RGB frames as input. Adding other modalities like depth maps or video priors could help deal with ambiguities.- Extending to longer videos. The sliding window approach works for long videos but is still limited by the maximum window size. Exploring online training or memory mechanisms could remove this limitation.- Generalizing to other tracking domains like multi-object tracking. The core ideas could apply to tracking objects instead of points.- Applying the method to downstream tasks. The improved point tracks could benefit many applications like 3D reconstruction, action recognition, etc.In summary, the main future directions relate to improving the transformer architecture, scaling up the approach, incorporating additional information sources, and applying the method to new tasks and settings. The core joint modeling of point tracks presents many exciting opportunities for future research.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes CoTracker, a new neural network architecture for jointly tracking multiple points in videos. The method takes as input a video and a variable number of starting track locations, and outputs full tracks for each point. The core of CoTracker is a transformer network that models correlations between different points across time through attention mechanisms. The transformer iteratively updates estimated trajectories by comparing track features to image features extracted from the video frames. To handle long videos, CoTracker applies the transformer in a sliding window manner, propagating information between windows. CoTracker is evaluated on several point tracking benchmarks including TAP-Vid, BADJA, and FastCapture. Experiments demonstrate that modeling correlations between points significantly improves tracking accuracy compared to prior methods that track points independently. The paper also investigates different point selection strategies for evaluation to ensure a fair comparison to single point trackers. Overall, CoTracker achieves state-of-the-art results, especially when tracking groups of correlated points. The flexible design allows tracking arbitrary points selected at any location and time in the video.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes CoTracker, a new neural network architecture for jointly tracking multiple points in videos. CoTracker is based on a transformer that takes as input a set of initial track estimates and iteratively refines them. The transformer models correlations between points via specialized attention layers. It operates on a 2D grid where one dimension is time and the other is the set of tracked points. To handle long videos, CoTracker uses a sliding window approach where it processes segments of the video and propagates information between overlapping windows. The transformer is trained in an unrolled fashion on synthetic data to learn to track points over long durations. During evaluation, CoTracker is provided with one or more points to track and supplements them with additional points in grid patterns for context. Experiments show CoTracker outperforms prior methods for tracking single points as well as groups of points on several benchmarks.
