# [Rigorously Assessing Natural Language Explanations of Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10312)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It develops a framework to evaluate the faithfulness of natural language explanations of neurons in large language models (LLMs). The two modes of evaluation are:

1) Observational mode: Evaluates whether a neuron activates on input strings picked out by the explanation. 

2) Intervention mode: Assesses whether the neuron is a causal mediator of the concept in the explanation.

- The framework is applied to audit the neuron explanation method proposed by Bills et al. (2023). 

- The evaluation finds low fidelity of the explanations generated by Bills et al.'s method: 

-- In observational mode, explanations had low precision and recall in predicting neuron activations.

-- In intervention mode, no evidence was found that neurons are causal mediators of concepts in the explanations.

- The paper discusses limitations of using natural language for explanations and individual neurons as the unit of analysis.

In summary, the key research question is how to rigorously evaluate the faithfulness of natural language explanations of neurons in large language models. The paper develops and applies an evaluation framework, revealing low fidelity of a recent neuron explanation method. It also critically examines the use of natural language and individual neurons for explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Developing an evaluation framework with two modes - observational and intervention-based - for assessing the faithfulness of natural language explanations of individual neurons in large language models. 

2. Applying the framework to audit the neuron explanations generated by the method of Bills et al. (2023). The audit revealed low precision/recall in the observational mode and little to no causal efficacy in the intervention mode.

3. Discussing fundamental limitations of using natural language explanations and individual neurons as the level of analysis. The paper argues structured formalisms and explanations of groups of neurons may be more promising.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing rigorous evaluation criteria and demonstrating their utility through a case study, which revealed concerns about the faithfulness of existing natural language neuron explanations. The paper concludes by critically examining the role of natural language and individual neurons in explanations.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper proposes a novel framework for rigorously evaluating natural language explanations of individual neurons in large language models. Most prior work has focused on generating natural language explanations, with less emphasis on systematically assessing their faithfulness. This paper makes an important contribution by developing robust evaluation methods.

- The proposed observational evaluation mode directly tests explanations against neuron activations. This is more rigorous than relying solely on correlation scores between explanations and activations, as some prior work has done. The intervention-based mode assesses causal efficacy, moving beyond just encoded information.

- The paper provides an in-depth analysis of a recent state-of-the-art method by Bills et al. (2023) for generating natural language explanations of neurons. The authors find that even top explanations from this method do not align well with neuron activations. The paperconvincingly demonstrates limitations of these generated explanations.

- The results align with an emerging view that individual neurons may not be the most meaningful unit of analysis for understanding large language models. The paper connects to recent studies suggesting representations are more distributed and superimposed across neurons.

- The paper's critical discussion of the inherent challenges with using natural language for explanations sets it apart from most prior work, which takes natural language as given. The authors make thoughtful arguments for considering more structured explanations.

Overall, this paper advances the state of knowledge by conducting a thorough, transparent investigation of an exciting new method. The frameworks proposed for evaluation and the critical analysis represent important contributions to the interpretability literature that should influence future research in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions:

- Developing explanation methods that use more structured formalisms like programming languages instead of natural language. They argue natural language explanations have inherent issues like vagueness and ambiguity that make them problematic for guiding technical decision making. 

- Moving beyond individual neurons as the primary unit of analysis. The paper provides evidence that individual neurons may not be the most interpretable level, and important computational structure likely exists in more abstract, distributed representations across groups of neurons.

- Exploring different model architectures beyond the Transformer, as the paper's analysis focused on evaluating explanations of a pretrained GPT-2 model. The behaviors and explanations could differ in other architectures.

- Extending their framework for evaluating explanation faithfulness to other explanation methods beyond the one focused on in this paper. Their proposed observational and intervention-based analyses seem generally applicable.

- Developing better automated metrics for evaluating natural language explanations, as precision/recall of neuron activations may not capture all desiderata.

In summary, the main suggestions are to move beyond natural language explanations of individual neurons, and to further develop rigorous methods for evaluating explanation faithfulness like their proposed observational and intervention-based analyses.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper develops a framework for rigorously evaluating natural language explanations of individual neurons in large language models. The authors propose an observational mode where they test whether a neuron activates on input strings picked out by an explanation, and an intervention mode where they assess if the neuron is a causal mediator of the concept in the explanation. They apply this framework to audit the neuron explanations generated by the GPT-4 method of Bills et al. (2023). Even for GPT-4's top-scoring explanations, they find low precision/recall in the observational mode and little evidence of causal efficacy in the intervention mode. Based on these assessments, the authors critically discuss inherent limitations of using ambiguous natural language for explanations and focusing explanations on individual neurons, rather than more abstract and distributed representations. They conclude that more rigorous explanatory frameworks grounded in formal languages and groups of neurons acting in concert may be more fruitful directions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper develops a framework for evaluating natural language explanations of individual neurons in large language models. The framework has two modes - observational and intervention-based. 

In the observational mode, the explanations are tested against neuron activations on relevant inputs to quantify false positives and false negatives. In the intervention mode, the explanations are evaluated on whether the associated neurons causally mediate the behavior on downstream tasks dependent on the explained concept. 

The framework is applied to audit neuron explanations generated by GPT-4 for a GPT-2 model. Even for top explanations rated highly confident by GPT-4, the observational evaluation shows low accuracy in predicting activations. The intervention evaluation finds minimal evidence that neurons are causal mediators of the concepts in explanations. The results highlight concerns around using natural language for model explanations and limitations of analyzing individual neurons.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for evaluating natural language explanations of individual neurons in large language models. The framework has two main modes: observational and intervention-based. In the observational mode, the claim that a neuron activates on inputs related to a concept is directly tested against a set of relevant inputs. Precision, recall and F1 can quantify alignment between explanations and activations. In the intervention mode, the claim that a neuron is a causal mediator of a concept is tested. Tasks are constructed where model behavior depends on the concept. Through interchange interventions, the causal efficacy of the explanation is measured by whether swapping neuron values changes model behavior as expected. The framework is applied to audit explanations of GPT-2 XL neurons automatically generated by GPT-4, revealing low observational alignment and little causal efficacy. The paper concludes by discussing limitations of using natural language and individual neurons for explanations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper seems to be addressing the problem of evaluating and assessing the faithfulness of natural language explanations for individual neurons in large language models. Specifically, it aims to define criteria and propose methods to verify whether natural language explanations accurately and meaningfully describe how a neuron represents a concept in the model. 

The key questions the paper is tackling are:

1) What criteria should we use to evaluate how well a natural language text explains the function of a neuron in a large language model?

2) How can we test if a natural language explanation faithfully captures what concept a neuron encodes and how it is used by the model? 

3) How do we determine if a neuron is a causal mediator of the concept described in its natural language explanation?

4) What are the limitations of using natural language explanations for individual neurons as a way to understand large language models?

The paper addresses these questions by proposing an evaluation framework with two components:

1) An observational mode that checks how well the explanation matches the neuron's activation pattern.

2) An intervention mode that evaluates whether the neuron is causally involved in mediating the concept in the explanation.

The paper applies this framework to audit a recent method that uses GPT-4 to generate natural language explanations of GPT-2 neurons. The key findings are that even top explanations exhibit substantial errors in the observational mode and show little to no causal efficacy in the intervention analysis. 

Finally, the paper also critically discusses inherent issues in using natural language to explain individual neurons, arguing for more structured explanations and analysis at higher levels of abstraction.
