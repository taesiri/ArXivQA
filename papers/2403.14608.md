## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey":

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, their massive scale, often containing hundreds of billions of parameters, poses considerable challenges when adapting them to new domains or datasets, a process called fine-tuning. Full fine-tuning of such large models incurs tremendous computational expenses and data requirements, making it infeasible for average users. 

Proposed Solution - Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):
PEFT refers to techniques that enable efficient adaptation of large pre-trained models to downstream tasks by updating only a small subset of parameters. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of PEFT methods, categorized into:

1. Additive PEFT: Introduces additional trainable modules like adapters and soft prompts into the model architecture.

2. Selective PEFT: Fine-tunes a subset of existing parameters identified using techniques like pruning and lottery tickets. 

3. Reparameterized PEFT: Learns a low-dimensional reparameterization of model weights that is converted back for inference.

4. Hybrid PEFT: Combines multiple PEFT strategies to utilize their complementary strengths.

The survey further discusses optimization strategies like pruning, quantization, and memory-efficient training to enhance the efficiency of PEFT methods. It also highlights applications of PEFT beyond NLP, including computer vision models, vision-language models, and diffusion models for image generation.

From a systems perspective, the survey explores challenges in distributed training, centralized serving, and concurrent fine-tuning of multiple PEFT models. Case studies of systems like DLoRA, PetS, and Punica are analyzed.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of PEFT algorithms
- Review of efficiency enhancement techniques for PEFT methods
- Discussion of PEFT applications across modalities and architectures
- Systems perspective on distributed training, serving, and concurrent fine-tuning
- Case studies of state-of-the-art PEFT systems
- Future directions for advancing PEFT research

By systematically organizing recent advancements in this rapidly evolving field, this survey serves as an indispensable reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to unlock the potentials of large models through efficient fine-tuning.
