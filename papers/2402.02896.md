# [LLM Agents in Interaction: Measuring Personality Consistency and   Linguistic Alignment in Interacting Populations of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02896)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Research on large language models (LLMs) has focused on either agent interaction or personalization, but little work has examined the effect of language interaction on the behavior of persona-conditioned LLM agents. 
- It's important to ensure agents remain consistent to assigned personality traits yet can engage in open, natural dialogues. 

Methods
- Use GPT-3.5 and bootstrap a population of agents using a variability-enhancing sampling algorithm. 
- Condition agents on either a "creative" or "analytical" personality profile using natural language prompts. 
- Assess personality consistency before, during and after agent interaction using Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaires and analysis of language use.
- Simulate non-interactive vs interactive conditions:
    - Non-interactive: Agents complete writing task individually
    - Interactive: Agents complete collaborative writing task

Key Findings
- Personality consistency varies between groups - "creative" agents give more consistent BFI responses than "analytical" agents.   
- In interaction, agents exhibit linguistic alignment towards partners, with language use becoming more similar.
- Alignment is asymmetric: "creative" agents adapt more towards "analytical" partners.

Contributions  
- First insight into impact of dialogue interaction on personality consistency of persona-conditioned LLMs
- Highlights need for new approaches to crafting robust, human-like personas for interactive LLM agents
- Lays groundwork for better understanding workings of interaction-based LLMs

In summary, this exploratory study analyzed whether persona-conditioned LLM agents can maintain consistent traits in interaction using BFI tests and language use analysis. Key findings are that consistency varies across profiles and linguistic alignment occurs, indicating the importance of developing robust persona conditioning approaches.
