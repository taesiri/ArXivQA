# [Generalization of LiNGAM that allows confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16661)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing causal discovery methods like LiNGAM face challenges when confounders are present. They require exponential time even when no confounders exist.
- Greedy search methods used in prior works can fail to identify the correct causal ordering.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes LiNGAM-MMI to quantify confounding using KL divergence between the joint noise distribution and product of marginals.
- It defines the true causal ordering as the one that minimizes this KL divergence.
- Formulates the problem as shortest path search on a graph with mutual information as edge weights.
- Provides an efficient algorithm to find the globally optimal variable ordering.

Main Contributions:
- Quantifies confounding using KL divergence of noise terms. Seeks ordering that minimizes this.
- Avoids issues with greedy search methods by formulating as a shortest path problem.
- Computational complexity same as LiNGAM when no confounders exist.
- Works for any confounder unlike prior works with constraints.
- Experiments show it outperforms prior methods in accuracy, especially for large number of variables.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to account for confounders in causal discovery using information theory concepts. The globally optimal search technique makes it efficient and robust compared to prior greedy methods. Key novelty is in defining and minimizing a specific KL divergence cost to identify the best causal ordering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method (LiNGAM-MMI) to determine the causal order of variables by quantifying and minimizing the confounding between variables using Kullback-Leibler divergence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It quantifies confounding by using the KL divergence between the distributions of the noise and defines the true order as the one that minimizes it. 

2. The optimal order is determined by formulating the problem as a shortest path problem, with the distance measured by the KL divergence. This global search approach requires relatively small computation, especially when the confounding is small.

3. Experiments show that the proposed procedure with the copula mutual information outperforms DirectLiNGAM with the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) even in the absence of confounding due to the global nature of the search and becomes more pronounced when p (the number of variables) is large.

So in summary, the main contribution is a new method called LiNGAM-MMI that can efficiently estimate the causal order of variables even in the presence of confounding by framing it as a shortest path problem and using copula mutual information. The global search allows it to outperform greedy methods like DirectLiNGAM.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- LiNGAM (Linear non-Gaussian acyclic models) - A framework for determining causal variable ordering by using additive noise models and assuming the noise terms are non-Gaussian and independent. 

- Confounding - When the noise terms in the LiNGAM model are not independent, which poses challenges for determining causality. The paper aims to address confounding in LiNGAM models.

- Quantifying confounding - The paper proposes using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantify the amount of confounding among the noise variables. The goal is to find the ordering that minimizes this.

- Shortest path problem formulation - The proposed method, LiNGAM-MMI, formulates the search for the best ordering as a shortest path problem, where the lengths of paths correspond to KL divergences. This allows efficient search for the globally optimal solution.

- Copula mutual information - The use of copulas to estimate mutual information between variables. This is used in the LiNGAM-MMI algorithm as the independence measure.

- Computational efficiency - A major focus is developing an approach that is efficient, especially when little to no confounding is present, matching traditional LiNGAM's speed.

In summary, the key ideas focus on extending LiNGAM to better handle confounding by quantifying it information-theoretically and using global optimization techniques to efficiently identify the ordering that minimizes the confounding.
