# [Dissecting vocabulary biases datasets through statistical testing and   automated data augmentation for artifact mitigation in Natural Language   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08747)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates dataset artifacts and bias mitigation strategies for natural language inference (NLI). Using the SNLI dataset, the authors first demonstrate the existence of artifacts by training an ELECTRA-based hypothesis-only model, which achieves surprisingly high accuracy of 69.37% without seeing the premises. They then uncover the source of these artifacts by proposing a novel statistical testing procedure on the vocabulary distribution in hypotheses, revealing significant associations between words (e.g. subjects like "people" and verbs like "sitting") and entailment labels that enable the hypothesis-only model's performance. To mitigate such biases, the authors automatically augment the training data using character and word-level perturbations from the nlpaug library, combining augmented data with original data to retrain models. Experiments show certain augmentations like word2vec similarity replacement reduce hypothesis-only model accuracy while improving overall model accuracy, demonstrating their effectiveness at enhancing performance and mitigating artifacts. Key contributions include artifact analysis via statistical testing and data augmentation strategies for bias mitigation in NLI.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Crowdsourced NLI datasets like SNLI contain biases or artifacts that allow models to perform well without learning logical relationships between premises and hypotheses. 
- Existing methods to detect biases lack interpretability to pinpoint the source of artifacts.

Solution: 
- Use a hypothesis-only model to show models can exploit biases and achieve high accuracy without seeing premises.
- Propose a novel statistical testing procedure to detect association between vocabulary distribution and labels, showing vocabulary biases exist.
- Implement automatic data augmentation techniques at character and word levels to rebalance vocabulary distributions and mitigate biases.

Methods:
- Fine-tune ELECTRA on hypothesis-only and full SNLI dataset to compare performance. 
- Extract main subjects and verbs and test association with labels using Ï‡2 test.
- Augment hypotheses using nlpaug library - character replacements, word embeddings similarity, synonyms, tf-idf similarity.

Results:
- Hypothesis-only model achieves 69.37% accuracy showing significant biases exist. 
- Statistical tests show clear vocabulary biases, e.g. "people" associates with entailment.
- Data augmentation improves full model accuracy up to 0.66% and reduces hypothesis-only accuracy up to 1.14%, mitigating biases.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel statistical testing procedure to interpret origins of biases
- Fully automatic data augmentation strategies to rebalance vocabulary distributions
- Quantitative experiments demonstrating efficacy of methods for improving model accuracy and mitigating biases


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates biases in the SNLI natural language inference dataset, proposes a statistical testing procedure to uncover vocabulary distribution biases, and mitigates these biases through automatic data augmentation techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper identifies and analyzes dataset artifacts (biases) in the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset using a hypothesis-only baseline model and a novel statistical testing procedure. It shows that vocabulary distribution in the hypotheses is a source of bias.

2) The paper proposes several automatic data augmentation techniques, at both character and word levels, to mitigate the identified biases in the SNLI dataset. These include random character replacement, word embedding replacements, synonym replacements, and tf-idf based word replacements.

3) The paper evaluates the proposed data augmentation methods by fine-tuning an ELECTRA model on the original and augmented SNLI datasets. It shows the augmentations are effective in improving the performance of models trained on complete premise-hypothesis pairs, while reducing the performance of hypothesis-only models.

In summary, the key contributions are the analysis and identification of biases, the proposal of automatic data augmentation methods to mitigate those biases, and experimental validation showing the augmentations are effective for this purpose.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a statistical testing procedure to uncover biases in the SNLI dataset. Can you explain in detail the steps involved in this statistical testing procedure? What syntactic information does it extract from the sentences and how does it test for associations between extracted words and labels?

2. The paper identifies vocabulary distribution biases in the SNLI dataset through the statistical testing. Can you discuss the key results from the statistical tests? Which words tended to be associated more with "entailment", "contradiction" or "neutral" labels?  

3. The paper employs several data augmentation techniques to mitigate the identified biases. Can you explain the rationale behind using data augmentation? How may augmenting the training data help in balancing the biased vocabulary distributions?

4. The paper implements augmentation at both character level and word level. What is the key difference between these two types of augmentations? Which word level augmentation techniques were used and how do they work?

5. One of the word level augmentation techniques used is replacement by Word2Vec similarity. Can you explain how Word2Vec model is used to find similar words for replacement? Why may replacing words with similar embeddings help mitigate biases?

6. Another technique used is replacement by synonyms from PPDB and WordNet databases. Can you describe these databases? And in what ways can replacement by synonyms help reduce biases in the datasets? 

7. The paper evaluates both complete models and hypothesis-only models after augmentation. What was the rationale behind evaluating both types of models? What did the results indicate about the impact of augmentations?

8. Which augmentation technique worked best at improving complete model performance? And which one reduced biases in the hypothesis-only model the most? Can you discuss why you think that is the case?

9. The current implementation relies solely on the nlpaug library for augmentations. What are some limitations of this approach that are mentioned? How can more targeted augmentations focused on biased words lead to better performance?

10. Do you think the proposed data augmentation methodology can generalize well to other NLP tasks and datasets that suffer from biases? Why or why not? What modifications might be needed to apply it to other domains?
