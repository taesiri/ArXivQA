# [Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10903)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether using ensemble methods can improve performance in distributional reinforcement learning. Specifically, the authors propose an extension called "Ensemble Categorical Control" (ECC) which involves generating distributional learning targets for each agent based on the ensemble mean of the individual target distributions. The central hypothesis appears to be that aggregating distributional information across an ensemble in this way will provide more robust targets and lead to faster, more stable learning compared to single-agent distributional algorithms like C51.The paper then empirically evaluates ECC on a set of Atari games, comparing it to C51 ensembles and single agents. The goal is to test whether ECC can yield strong individual agent performance while also benefiting from the ensemble in terms of sample efficiency. Evaluating ECC's performance serves to test the central hypothesis about the benefits of ensembling in distributional RL.In summary, the key research question is whether aggregation methods like ECC can improve on standard single-agent distributional RL, and the experiments aim to validate the hypothesis that it provides more robust and efficient learning.
