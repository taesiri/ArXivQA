# [Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10903)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether using ensemble methods can improve performance in distributional reinforcement learning. Specifically, the authors propose an extension called "Ensemble Categorical Control" (ECC) which involves generating distributional learning targets for each agent based on the ensemble mean of the individual target distributions. The central hypothesis appears to be that aggregating distributional information across an ensemble in this way will provide more robust targets and lead to faster, more stable learning compared to single-agent distributional algorithms like C51.The paper then empirically evaluates ECC on a set of Atari games, comparing it to C51 ensembles and single agents. The goal is to test whether ECC can yield strong individual agent performance while also benefiting from the ensemble in terms of sample efficiency. Evaluating ECC's performance serves to test the central hypothesis about the benefits of ensembling in distributional RL.In summary, the key research question is whether aggregation methods like ECC can improve on standard single-agent distributional RL, and the experiments aim to validate the hypothesis that it provides more robust and efficient learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new algorithm called Ensemble Categorical Control (ECC) for reinforcement learning. ECC is an extension of Categorical Distributional Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) where the distributional learning targets are based on the ensemble mean of multiple agent target distributions. 2. It provides an empirical evaluation of ECC on a subset of Atari 2600 games, showing that it can lead to stronger individual agent performance and overall ensemble performance compared to independent CDRL agents.3. It discusses how the distributional perspective allows implicit information sharing between agents during learning when using ensemble targets. The paper argues this results in more robust targets and a more nuanced aggregated picture.4. It introduces the idea of using distributional aggregation methods like the ensemble mean in reinforcement learning, preserving multimodality compared to aggregating only expected values.5. The paper proposes a specific algorithm and provides pseudocode for implementing ECC with function approximation, experience replay, and periodic ensemble target network updates.6. It shares code and data for an implementation and evaluation of ECC on Atari games, facilitating reproducibility and further research.In summary, the main contributions are proposing the ECC algorithm, empirically evaluating it on Atari games, and discussing the potential benefits of the distributional ensemble approach for more robust and sample-efficient reinforcement learning. The algorithm details and code release also make this a self-contained research contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes an extension to categorical distributional reinforcement learning where ensembles of agents learn by using aggregated distributional targets. This allows implicit information sharing between agents during training to potentially accelerate and robustify learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of distributional reinforcement learning:- The main contribution of this paper is proposing an ensemble method called "Ensemble Categorical Control" (ECC) that extends categorical distributional RL by using averaged ensemble targets during learning. Using ensembles in RL is not a new idea, but applying it in the distributional RL setting seems novel.- Most prior work on distributional RL has focused on developing new algorithms and theoretical analysis. In contrast, this paper takes an existing algorithm (C51) and proposes an ensemble extension for improved performance. The empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the ECC extension.- The paper compares ECC to simply averaging independently trained C51 agents. The results show ECC leads to better individual agent performance and overall ensemble efficiency. This highlights the benefits of ECC's coupled training method over standard ensembling.- The paper tests ECC using the standard Atari benchmarks that are commonly used to evaluate distributional RL algorithms. This allows some informal comparison to prior published results, though direct comparisons are difficult due to differences in implementation details.- The theoretical analysis and understanding of ECC is limited compared to recent distributional RL papers. The focus is more on empirical demonstration. Further analysis of ECC's properties would help situate it within the broader theory.Overall, I would say this paper provides a novel ensemble approach for improving performance of an existing distributional RL algorithm. The results are promising but mainly empirically driven. More analysis and comparisons to prior art could further highlight ECC's contributions. The application of ensembles in this novel way is likely the biggest differentiation from prior distributional RL research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Doing a more comprehensive empirical study on a wider range of environments to better understand the properties and performance of the Ensemble Categorical Control (ECC) procedure. The authors tested ECC on a small subset of 5 Atari games, so expanding this to more environments could provide more insights.- Analyzing convergence and doing hyperparameter tuning, especially around the target network update frequency. The authors mention this could help understand things like premature convergence to correlated agents.- Trying different ensemble sizes and agent capacities to see the effects on performance and sample efficiency. Using lower capacity agents as ensemble size scales up could help counter poor scalability.- Switching from ECC to CDRL after reaching a robust performance level with ECC, to see if this can further boost performance.- Considering different ways to generate ensemble targets, not just the mean mixture distribution. Other aggregation methods based on the distributional information could be explored.- Theoretical analysis of the convergence properties and sample efficiency of ECC compared to baseline CDRL.- Exploring whether the benefits of ECC diminish if using a different base algorithm than CDRL, one that is more stable or finds optimal policies easier by itself.- Testing ECC in more complex tasks like continuous control problems.So in summary, the main suggested directions are around empirical analysis in broader contexts, theoretical understanding especially around convergence, and exploring variations of the ensemble training scheme.
