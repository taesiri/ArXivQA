# [Exact Tensor Completion Powered by Arbitrary Linear Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03468)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing tensor completion models require the linear transform used to be orthogonal, which limits flexibility. However, recent works show that non-invertible "slim" transforms that map the tensor to a higher dimensional space can achieve better recovery accuracy. This paper aims to provide theoretical guarantees for tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms without constraints on invertibility or orthogonality.

Proposed Solution:
1. Define a new natural tensor-tensor product directly on the transform domain and subsequently a new tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD). This leads to a new definition of the tensor nuclear norm.

2. Formulate a tensor completion program that minimizes the nuclear norm of the transformed tensor subject to data consistency constraints.

3. Prove that under certain tensor incoherence conditions, this program guarantees exact tensor completion even with arbitrary linear transforms. The proof is challenging since the transform is mingled with operators and norms. New norm-controlling lemmas need to be established.

4. Design an efficient algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the program.

Main Contributions:
1. New definitions of tensor-tensor product, t-SVD and tensor nuclear norm enable analysis directly in transform domain without requiring invertibility.

2. First theoretical guarantee for exact tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms, which greatly enhances model flexibility.

3. Proof roadmap and technical lemmas to control norms with mingled transform operator.

4. Efficient algorithm to solve the proposed model and experiments showing superiority over existing methods on both synthetic and real visual data.

In summary, this paper establishes theoretical foundations and practical methods for tensor completion powered by arbitrary linear transforms with neither isotropy nor invertibility constraints. The new proof techniques and experimental results highlight the advantages of using non-invertible slim transforms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper establishes the theoretical guarantee of exact tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms by defining a new tensor-tensor product, tensor SVD, and tensor nuclear norm directly on the transform domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) It establishes the theoretical guarantee of exact tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms, without requiring the transforms to be orthogonal or invertible. 

2) It defines a new tensor-tensor product, tensor SVD, and tensor nuclear norm that are naturally defined on the transform domain.

3) It proposes an efficient ADMM algorithm to solve the tensor completion problem with arbitrary transforms, and proves that under certain tensor incoherence conditions, the original tensor can be exactly recovered with high probability. 

4) The new proof techniques developed in this paper to deal with the mingling of the arbitrary transform in the analysis are non-trivial and enhance the flexibility of tensor completion models.

5) Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real visual data demonstrate the superiority of using non-invertible "slim" transforms in tensor completion, validating the theoretical analysis.

In summary, this paper significantly expands the scope of transforms applicable in tensor completion problems, with solid theoretical guarantees, efficient algorithms, and empirical validation. The new tools and proof techniques can potentially benefit other low-rank tensor related research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Tensor completion 
- Tensor nuclear norm (TNN)
- Tensor-tensor product
- Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD)
- Arbitrary linear transforms
- Tensor incoherence conditions
- Exact recovery guarantee
- Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)

The paper studies the problem of tensor completion, where the goal is to perfectly recover a low-rank tensor from partial observations. A key contribution is providing theoretical guarantees for exact tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms, not just orthogonal transforms as studied in prior works. 

To enable this more general analysis, the paper introduces new definitions of tensor-tensor products, t-SVD, tensor norms, and tensor incoherence directly on the transform domain. These tools allow deriving guarantees for completion based on the properties of the linear transform.

The paper also designs an ADMM algorithm to efficiently solve the tensor completion optimization problem with arbitrary transforms. Experiments on both synthetic and visual data demonstrate the benefits of using non-invertible "slim" transforms compared to standard orthogonal transforms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper defines a new tensor-tensor product directly on the transform domain. How does this definition compare to prior definitions that encapsulate the transform in the tensor-tensor product? What are the key advantages of defining the product directly on the transform domain?

2. The paper introduces a new definition of the tensor nuclear norm based on the proposed tensor-tensor product. How does this nuclear norm relate to existing definitions like the tubal nuclear norm? What kinds of tensors can be better modeled under this new nuclear norm?

3. The proof of the main theorem on exact tensor completion is noted to be challenging since the transform mingles with the operators. Can you walk through the key steps where bounding the spectral norms of these mingled operators was most difficult? What techniques did you use to handle this added complexity?

4. How did you arrive at the formulation of the tensor incoherence conditions involving the transform matrix T? How do these conditions generalize previous notions of incoherence for tensors?

5. The condition number and stable rank of the transform matrix T appear in the main theorems. How sensitive is the performance of the tensor completion method to these matrix properties? How should one design T to optimize recovery?

6. The ADMM algorithm is used to solve the tensor completion program. Could other optimization methods like Riemannian optimization also be applied here? What benefits or challenges might that present?

7. For the visual data experiments, what guided your choices of transforms to compare? Why do you think the non-invertible slim transforms tended to outperform the standard orthogonal transforms? 

8. The idea of concatenating multiple transform matrices is interesting. How well does this ensemble approach capture multiplicative information compared to more complex multivariate transforms?

9. The paper notes the transform design is data-dependent and coupled in a complex way. Do you have any thoughts on how to systematically learn good transforms for tensor completion problems? 

10. The guarantee for exact recovery is powerful, but how robust is the method if the tensor deviates slightly from low rank or if there are small dense errors? Can the theory be extended to bound the performance in such cases?
