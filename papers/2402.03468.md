# [Exact Tensor Completion Powered by Arbitrary Linear Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03468)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing tensor completion models require the linear transform used to be orthogonal, which limits flexibility. However, recent works show that non-invertible "slim" transforms that map the tensor to a higher dimensional space can achieve better recovery accuracy. This paper aims to provide theoretical guarantees for tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms without constraints on invertibility or orthogonality.

Proposed Solution:
1. Define a new natural tensor-tensor product directly on the transform domain and subsequently a new tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD). This leads to a new definition of the tensor nuclear norm.

2. Formulate a tensor completion program that minimizes the nuclear norm of the transformed tensor subject to data consistency constraints.

3. Prove that under certain tensor incoherence conditions, this program guarantees exact tensor completion even with arbitrary linear transforms. The proof is challenging since the transform is mingled with operators and norms. New norm-controlling lemmas need to be established.

4. Design an efficient algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the program.

Main Contributions:
1. New definitions of tensor-tensor product, t-SVD and tensor nuclear norm enable analysis directly in transform domain without requiring invertibility.

2. First theoretical guarantee for exact tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms, which greatly enhances model flexibility.

3. Proof roadmap and technical lemmas to control norms with mingled transform operator.

4. Efficient algorithm to solve the proposed model and experiments showing superiority over existing methods on both synthetic and real visual data.

In summary, this paper establishes theoretical foundations and practical methods for tensor completion powered by arbitrary linear transforms with neither isotropy nor invertibility constraints. The new proof techniques and experimental results highlight the advantages of using non-invertible slim transforms.
