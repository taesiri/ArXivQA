# [High-Performance Transformers for Table Structure Recognition Need Early   Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Table structure recognition (TSR) aims to extract the structure and cell data from tabular images into a machine-readable format. 
- Existing TSR methods use CNN backbones for the visual encoder and transformers for the textual decoder. However, the CNN backbones account for nearly half of the total parameters, reduce training/inference speed, and hinder self-supervised learning potential.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors design a lightweight visual encoder using a convolutional stem, which matches CNN backbone performance with much simpler model complexity.

Key Discoveries:
- The convolutional stem strikes an optimal balance between two crucial factors: higher receptive field (RF) ratio to "see" an appropriate table portion, and longer sequence length to "store" the complex structure.
- Linear projection suffers due to limited RF and sequence length. CNN backbones have high RF but high complexity.
- Ablation studies show RF ratio and sequence length are positively correlated with TSR performance, especially for complex tables.

Main Contributions:
- Show convolutional stem matches CNN performance for TSR with lower model complexity
- Identify the impacts of RF ratio and sequence length on TSR transformer performance
- Provide reproducible details and open-source code for model configurations, metrics, optimizers etc. to facilitate innovation and fair comparisons in the TSR domain

In summary, the paper designs a lightweight visual encoder using a convolutional stem for TSR that balances performance and complexity. It highlights the importance of RF ratio and sequence length for TSR transformers through ablation studies. The paper aims to enable reproducible research to drive progress in TSR.
