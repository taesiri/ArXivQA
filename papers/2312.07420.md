# [FairSISA: Ensemble Post-Processing to Improve Fairness of Unlearning in   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07420)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the interplay between machine unlearning techniques and fairness for large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it focuses on a popular unlearning framework called Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training, which creates an ensemble of models trained on disjoint subsets of data. Through experiments on toxic text classification, the authors empirically demonstrate that SISA can reduce the fairness of LLMs, measured by equalized odds. To address this, the paper proposes and evaluates three post-processing methods to improve the fairness-accuracy trade-off of models produced by SISA. The key contribution is an optimal post-processing method for SISA ensembles that generalizes prior work and is proven to derive the fairest possible predictor. Experiments on multiple LLMs show that the proposed "FairSISA" framework with ensemble post-processing achieves improved fairness with minimal impact on accuracy. By tackling the under-explored connection between unlearning and fairness, this work makes important steps towards building reliable and ethical LLMs.
