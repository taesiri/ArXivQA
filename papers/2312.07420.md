# [FairSISA: Ensemble Post-Processing to Improve Fairness of Unlearning in   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07420)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the interplay between machine unlearning techniques and fairness for large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it focuses on a popular unlearning framework called Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training, which creates an ensemble of models trained on disjoint subsets of data. Through experiments on toxic text classification, the authors empirically demonstrate that SISA can reduce the fairness of LLMs, measured by equalized odds. To address this, the paper proposes and evaluates three post-processing methods to improve the fairness-accuracy trade-off of models produced by SISA. The key contribution is an optimal post-processing method for SISA ensembles that generalizes prior work and is proven to derive the fairest possible predictor. Experiments on multiple LLMs show that the proposed "FairSISA" framework with ensemble post-processing achieves improved fairness with minimal impact on accuracy. By tackling the under-explored connection between unlearning and fairness, this work makes important steps towards building reliable and ethical LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes post-processing methods to improve the fairness of large language models trained using the SISA unlearning framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing post-processing bias mitigation techniques to improve the fairness of large language models (LLMs) trained using the SISA unlearning framework. Specifically:

1) The paper empirically demonstrates that the SISA unlearning framework can produce LLM models that are less fair on the task of toxic text classification. 

2) The paper adapts the post-processing fairness improvement technique from Hardt et al. (2016) to design three methods that can handle model ensembles produced by SISA. 

3) The paper proves that one of the proposed methods (Ensemble Post-Processing) generalizes the optimization problem from Hardt et al. (2016) to ensemble models and produces an optimal fair predictor.

4) Through experiments, the paper shows the efficacy of the proposed post-processing techniques, called FairSISA, in improving the accuracy-fairness trade-off of LLM models trained with SISA unlearning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating post-processing methods to mitigate bias and improve fairness for the popular SISA unlearning framework applied to large language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper adapts the post-processing method from Hardt et al. (2016) to handle model ensembles. What are the key challenges in generalizing post-processing techniques designed for single models to ensembles? Why is directly applying single model techniques sub-optimal?

2. The paper proposes three different ways to apply post-processing to SISA ensembles. What is the intuition behind these three approaches (aggregate-then-postprocess, postprocess-then-aggregate, ensemble postprocess)? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages?

3. Proposition 1 shows that the ensemble post-processing method results in an optimal fair predictor. Walk through the key steps in the proof. What assumptions are made? How does optimality break down if assumptions are violated?  

4. The ensemble post-processing method formulates an optimization problem with an exponential (in ensemble size S) number of variables. Is this optimization problem tractable? If not, can you propose approximate solution techniques?

5. The paper evaluates post-processing methods on BERT, DistilGPT2 and GPT2 models. How do you expect the performance to vary for other Transformer-based language models? What model characteristics are most indicative of efficacy of post-processing?

6. The paper focuses on a dataset from social media domain. How do you expect the fairness-accuracy tradeoff to change for other domains such as scientific text, dialogue systems, etc.? When is post-processing expected to work better or worse?

7. The paper uses equalized odds as the metric for group fairness. How can the methods be extended for other prevailing notions of fairness such as demographic parity, equality of opportunity, etc.? What are the challenges involved?

8. The paper studies post-processing for SISA ensembles. How can these methods be adapted for other approximate or exact unlearning frameworks for neural networks? What are the open challenges? 

9. From analyzing empirical results, the paper finds that post-processing after aggregating individual model predictions works the best. Provide hypotheses explaining this observation. How can further analysis be done to conclusively identify the best approach?

10. The paper focuses on toxic text classification. Discuss how the interplay between unlearning and fairness could extend to other tasks for NLP models including dialogue systems, summarization, translation etc. What are interesting open problems at this intersection?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets, making it infeasible to curate all the data properly. As a result, undesirable data may get ingested during training. 
- Retraining LLMs from scratch to remove the influence of undesirable data is impractical due to the high computational costs. This has led to the development of "unlearning" techniques to efficiently modify models to forget undesirable data without full retraining.
- However, the impact of unlearning methods on other critical aspects of LLMs such as fairness has been scarcely studied. This work focuses on studying the interplay between a popular unlearning method called SISA and fairness of LLMs.

Proposed Solution - SISA Framework:
- SISA works by partitioning the training data into disjoint shards and training separate models on each shard, creating an ensemble. During inference, predictions from the models are aggregated via majority voting. 
- To unlearn some data, only the constituent models corresponding to shards containing that data are retrained, avoiding full retraining.

Key Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrate that SISA unlearning can reduce fairness of LLMs, measured using equalized odds (EO) metric for group fairness.
- Propose and adapt post-processing bias mitigation methods to improve fairness of SISA, including a method that generalizes prior work to provably optimize accuracy subject to EO constraints.
- Show improved accuracy-EO tradeoff from post-processing, with the optimized method achieving highest accuracy for a given EO goal.

In summary, this is the first work studying the interplay between popular unlearning methods and fairness for LLMs. It shows unlearning can reduce fairness and proposes tailored post-processing techniques to mitigate this, providing useful insights for deploying unlearning in practice.
