# [Computing Transition Pathways for the Study of Rare Events Using Deep   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on computing transition pathways between metastable states in complex systems like molecules. Understanding these transition pathways is important to characterize mechanisms underlying molecular conformational changes or phase transitions. However, computing these pathways is challenging, especially for high-dimensional systems with rough energy landscapes containing many local minima. Existing methods like string method can get trapped in local minima.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper formulates the path finding problem as minimizing a cost functional over paths connecting the metastable states. To handle roughness, they adapt the Freidlin-Wentzell action by using an effective force averaged from short trajectories. They parameterize paths by discrete states with fixed discrete time steps, converting the problem to discrete optimization. 

They solve this optimization using a deep reinforcement learning (RL) actor-critic algorithm based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. The actor network outputs actions (next states) to try to minimize cost, while the critic network evaluates the cost. Key aspects include:

- Stochastic policy to explore state space, using the potential force to guide search
- Experience replay and target networks to stabilize training 
- Incorporating physical properties into networks for faster training

The RL exploitation and exploration allows efficient sampling of transitions, avoiding local minima, to find the global optimal path.


Main Contributions:

- Novel problem formulation adapting Freidlin-Wentzell theory to handle roughness
- Using deep RL for transition path optimization, allowing efficient exploration
- Handling high-dimensional molecular systems with rough energy landscape
- Demonstrated on 2D system, 10D Mueller potential, 7 particle Lennard Jones

The method establishes an accurate and efficient framework to sample rare transition events and compute transition pathways in complex systems, useful in physics, chemistry and biology.
