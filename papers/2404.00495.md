# [Configurable Safety Tuning of Language Models with Synthetic Preference   Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00495)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- State-of-the-art language model fine-tuning techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) hardcode certain predefined safe behaviors into the model during training. This restricts flexibility and user control over safety configurations during deployment.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Configurable Safety Tuning (CST), a novel fine-tuning strategy that augments DPO using synthetic preference data. 

- CST introduces a system prompt at inference time that specifies the desired safety configuration. This allows disabling/enabling different safety preferences flexibly based on user need.

- It combines DPO loss with self-critiquing to generate synthetic preference dataset of original and safety-revised response pairs. 

- By conditioning the preference probability on the system prompt, CST can capture opposing safety behaviors using the same dataset.

Main Contributions:
- CST enables flexible safety configuration of language models at inference time to match deployment needs.

- It retains general capabilities of models like reasoning and general knowledge.

- Experiments show CST manages different safety configurations well while avoiding pitfalls like over-conservatism compared to vanilla DPO.

- CST works robustly even when combining preference data from diverse tasks involving different system prompts.

In summary, the key innovation is facilitating configurable and controlled safety tuning of language models with synthetic preference data and system prompts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Configurable Safety Tuning (CST), a novel method that augments Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with synthetic preference data to facilitate flexible safety configuration of large language models at inference time through system prompts specifying desired safety behaviors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel fine-tuning strategy called Configurable Safety Tuning (CST) for flexible safety configuration of large language models (LLMs) at inference time. 

Specifically, CST builds on top of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique and introduces a system prompt that specifies the desired safety configuration when querying the LLM. This allows users to enable or disable certain safety preferences dynamically without needing to retrain the entire model.

The key advantage of CST over standard DPO is that it does not hard-code predefined safe behaviors into the LLM, but rather equips the model with the capability to flexibly adjust its safety level based on the system prompt provided at inference time. This facilitates more customizable and versatile control of LLMs to suit evolving needs.

The experiments demonstrate that CST can successfully manage different safety configurations while retaining strong performance on general LLM capabilities, outperforming vanilla DPO methods that tend to overfit to a particular hardcoded notion of safety. So in summary, the main contribution is this flexible and configurable approach to LLM safety tuning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Configurable Safety Tuning (CST) method proposed in the paper:

1. How does CST improve upon standard Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for controlling language model behavior at inference time? What are the key differences in the training procedures?

2. The system prompts $s_0$ and $s_1$ play a crucial role in CST. How are they formulated and used during training and inference to enable flexible safety configurations? 

3. The paper mentions retaining general capabilities of the language models after CST fine-tuning. What evaluation tasks were used to demonstrate this? How did CST models compare to the original models?

4. What types of synthetic preference data were used for training the CST models discussed? Could other sources of preference data be integrated into the CST framework?

5. How exactly is the self-critique method used to refine the original responses $y_0$ into the preferred safe responses $y_1$ in the training data?

6. Could the CST approach be extended to allow even more fine-grained control over language model behaviors instead of just binary safe/unsafe modes? What challenges might this entail?

7. What were some key implementation details, hyperparameters, or training configurations used to optimize the CST training procedure? 

8. The paper focuses on safety, but could CST be used to induce and control other types of language model behaviors as well?

9. How scalable is the CST approach as language models continue to grow in size and capabilities? Would the methodology still be feasible?

10. What ideas does the paper propose for future work building upon the CST method? What limitations still need to be addressed?
