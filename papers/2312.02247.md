# [Federated Active Learning for Target Domain Generalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) aims to train machine learning models without sharing raw data to address privacy concerns. However, FL faces challenges due to heterogeneous data distributions across clients leading to poor generalization. 
- Most FL methods do not address the need for data annotation and assume clients have annotated their data. However, data annotation is laborious and costly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FEDALV, a framework that combines federated domain generalization (FDG) and active learning (AL) to improve generalization to unseen target domains with minimal need for data annotations.

- FEDALV has two key components:
    1) FEDA: A FDG pipeline with two optimization stages - local regularizations to reduce feature complexity and align representations; global alignment of free energies between source and target to reduce biases. Helps FDG.
    
    2) AL framework: Dynamically identifies and queries most informative instances from source clients to direct learning towards critical regions for generalization. Reduces need for annotations.
    
- FEDALV selection algorithm tracks target samples with highest free energies using the global model. Then selects closest source samples in representation space to query for labeling. Allows variation in budgets across clients.

Key Contributions:
- First work to employ AL for domain generalization in federated setting. Addresses need for annotations.
- FEDA method for FDG that achieves state-of-the-art performance by inducing domain-invariant representations locally and minimizing free energy biases globally.
- FEDALV selection algorithm that effectively identifies most informative source samples for generalization by leveraging free energy biases.
- Quantitative experiments on 3 benchmarks demonstrate efficacy of FEDA for FDG and FEDALV over competing methods for generalization with minimal annotations.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in addressing key challenges of generalization and annotation needs in FL through an integrated framework of FDG and AL principles.
