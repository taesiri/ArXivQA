# [Active Admittance Control with Iterative Learning for General-Purpose   Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16560)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robots need competence in force control to handle a variety of interactive tasks and multi-task scenarios. However, most existing methods are not generalized for multi-task applications and require tedious parameter tuning. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a novel hybrid control framework called "ILC-MBK" based on active admittance control and iterative learning for parameter tuning. 
- Admittance control provides flexibility as the underlying algorithm. Iterative learning regulates the parameters of the admittance model to enable learning.
- The admittance model parameters (m, b, k) are transformed into system inputs for convenient parameter tuning in the iterative learning process.
- An iterative update law called "ILC-MBK" is proposed to explore the relationship between parameters and tracking performance and update the parameters accordingly.
- Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed and proven.

Main Contributions:
- A highly generalizable and learnable interaction force control framework for repetitive multi-task scenarios.
- Transformation of admittance parameters into iterative learning inputs for convenient tuning.  
- Proposition of the ILC-MBK update law to update admittance parameters based on tracking errors.
- Convergence analysis of the ILC-MBK algorithm.  
- Verification of the method's effectiveness, generalization capability and 98.21% improvement over traditional methods on 4 representative interaction tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of admittance control flexibility and iterative learning's self-tuning ability into a unified force control framework that works across multiple interactive tasks. The convergence and superiority of the method are rigorously validated.
