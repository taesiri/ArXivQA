# [Scene-LLM: Extending Language Model for 3D Visual Understanding and   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing visual-language models (VLMs) have made progress in 2D visual-language understanding, but are limited in 3D visual reasoning tasks for indoor scenes due to lacking persistent 3D spatial information. 
- Current 3D VLMs primarily handle static 3D scenes, less adaptable for interactive planning with scene changes.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces Scene-LLM, a 3D visual-language model (3D-VLM) that enhances agents' abilities in interactive 3D indoor environments by integrating reasoning strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs).

- Scene-LLM adopts a hybrid 3D visual feature representation that incorporates dense spatial information and supports scene state updates. 

- It employs a projection layer to efficiently project these 3D features into the pre-trained textual embedding space of LLM.

- Unique to Scene-LLM is the integration of both scene-level and egocentric 3D information, which is pivotal for interactive planning as scene-level data supports global planning while egocentric data is important for localization. 

- Egocentric 3D frame features are used for feature alignment to incorporate fine-grained concepts.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces Scene-LLM, a 3D-VLM that connects 3D visual information with LLM and sets new state-of-the-art on 3D-VQA and interactive planning benchmarks

- Proposes an effective 3D visual representation that captures fine-grained information, supports state changes, and can be easily incorporated into LLM with a light-weight projector

- Creates a large-scale 3D-visual-language dataset with over 190k egocentric and 500k scene-level pairs, useful for 3D and text feature alignment
