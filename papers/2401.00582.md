# [An Analysis of Embedding Layers and Similarity Scores using Siamese   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00582)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex natural language tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and data generation. A critical capability needed in LLMs is the ability to compute semantic similarity between sentences and documents to understand relationships and context. 
- Embedding layers are fundamental for converting input text into vector representations that can be used to calculate similarity scores. There are various embedding algorithms (BERT, OpenAI, PaLM) that differ in their approach.
- The goal of this research is to analyze and compare leading embedding algorithms on metrics of similarity score accuracy as well as carbon footprint.

Methods:
- A dataset of 3048 similar and dissimilar medical question pairs is used.
- Three embedding algorithms are tested - BERT, OpenAI, PaLM. Each has a different approach to contextualizing words and capturing relationships.
- Associated similarity score formulas are used with each embedding method to quantify sentence similarity. Cosine similarity is also measured as a baseline.  
- Siamese neural networks are implemented with each embedding method to potentially improve similarity accuracy.
- Carbon footprint per training epoch and total emissions are calculated for each method.

Results:  
- OpenAI embeddings had the highest similarity accuracy, followed by PaLM and then BERT. All were substantially better than cosine similarity.
- Siamese networks slightly improved accuracy across the board but relative performance between methods was similar.
- BERT had the lowest carbon footprint. OpenAI was very high, while PaLM struck a balance between accuracy and sustainability.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive assessment of leading embedding techniques for sentence similarity tasks, evaluating accuracy, neural network integration, and environmental impact. The findings allow recommendations to be made on selection criteria based on use case priorities.
