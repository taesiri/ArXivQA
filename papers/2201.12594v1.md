# [Robust Imitation Learning from Corrupted Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12594v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question this paper aims to address is:

Can we develop an imitation learning algorithm that is robust to corrupted demonstrations, where a constant fraction of the demonstration data can be arbitrarily corrupted or contain outliers?

The key hypothesis is that by using a robust Median-of-Means (MOM) objective instead of the standard maximum likelihood objective, the authors' proposed algorithm called Robust Behavior Cloning (RBC) can learn policies that are resilient to corrupted demonstrations and achieve similar performance to Behavior Cloning on expert demonstrations without outliers.

In summary, the central research question is developing a robust imitation learning method that can handle demonstrations with outliers, and the hypothesis is that a MOM-based approach can achieve this goal. The authors provide theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations to validate the effectiveness of their proposed RBC algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel robust imitation learning algorithm called Robust Behavior Cloning (RBC) for learning from corrupted demonstrations. The key contributions are:

- They formally define the setting of learning from corrupted demonstrations, where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a constant fraction of the demonstrations. This is a challenging setting that allows for arbitrary outliers. 

- They propose the RBC algorithm based on a median-of-means objective that is robust to the constant fraction of arbitrary corruptions. RBC modifies the standard BC objective to be more robust.

- They provide theoretical analysis showing that RBC achieves nearly the same error rates and sample complexity guarantees as standard BC on expert demonstrations, even with the constant fraction of corruptions.

- They demonstrate the effectiveness of RBC on several continuous control tasks, showing its robustness empirically. RBC matches the performance of BC on expert demonstrations and outperforms baseline methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and analyzing a theoretically grounded and empirically effective robust imitation learning method that can learn from corrupted demonstrations with arbitrary outliers. This is enabled by the RBC algorithm and its robust median-of-means objective function.
