# [Graph Metanetworks for Processing Diverse Neural Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04501)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Graph Metanetworks (GMNs), a new approach for building metanetworks - neural networks that process the parameters of other neural networks as data. The key idea is to represent the input neural network architecture as a graph, with edges corresponding to parameters, and then apply graph neural networks to process this graph while respecting symmetries in the parameter space. Compared to prior metanetwork architectures, GMNs are more general, able to handle complex modules like attention and normalization layers, unlike competing methods limited to MLPs and basic CNNs. The authors prove GMNs are provably expressive, able to simulate prior metanetworks, and equivariant to permutations of the input network parameters. Through experiments on tasks like predicting accuracy and editing 2D implicit neural representations, they demonstrate GMNs achieve strong performance across diverse neural network inputs. A benefit of the graph-based approach is flexibility - GMNs easily process networks of varying architectures. Overall, this graph perspective enables building metanetworks that can analyze and transform broad classes of neural networks in a principled manner.
