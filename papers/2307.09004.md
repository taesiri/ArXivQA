# [Ord2Seq: Regarding Ordinal Regression as Label Sequence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09004)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the performance of ordinal regression models, particularly in distinguishing between adjacent categories? 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- Proposing a new approach called Ord2Seq that transforms the ordinal regression problem into a sequence prediction task. This is done by mapping the ordinal category labels to binary label sequences using a dichotomic tree structure. 

- Regarding ordinal regression as a series of recursive binary classification steps following a dichotomic search procedure. This allows the model to focus on distinguishing between a pair of adjacent categories at each step.

- Designing a novel masked decision decoder to predict the binary label sequence. It uses a masking strategy to suppress interference from eliminated categories, letting the model focus on the remaining categories at each step.

- Achieving state-of-the-art performance on ordinal regression benchmarks by effectively distinguishing between adjacent categories, which is shown to be the main source of performance gain.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling ordinal regression as a sequence of binary decisions between adjacent categories will improve performance, and the Ord2Seq framework is proposed to achieve this. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new sequence prediction framework called Ord2Seq for ordinal regression. The key ideas are:

- Transforming ordinal category labels into binary label sequences using a dichotomic tree structure. This allows reformulating ordinal regression as a sequence prediction problem.

- Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture to predict the binary label sequence in a progressive manner. This decomposes ordinal regression into a series of recursive binary classification steps. 

- Designing a masked decision decoder to focus on distinguishing adjacent categories during prediction by suppressing the loss interference from eliminated categories.

- Achieving state-of-the-art performance on several ordinal regression tasks such as age estimation, image aesthetics grading, historical image dating, and diabetic retinopathy grading.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel perspective to transform ordinal regression into a sequence prediction problem using dichotomy. The Ord2Seq framework effectively distinguishes adjacent categories in a progressive manner and achieves superior performance compared to prior ordinal regression methods. The key innovation is the dichotomy-based sequence prediction approach.
