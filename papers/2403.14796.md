# [Planning and Acting While the Clock Ticks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Standard temporal planning assumes all planning happens offline before execution starts. Situated temporal planning accounts for time passing during planning, but still requires a complete plan before execution starts.
- In some problems with tight deadlines, there may not be enough time to find a complete plan before needing to execute the first action. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper formalizes the problem of "concurrent planning and execution", where actions can be dispatched for execution before planning terminates. 
- This concurrently handles wall clock deadlines (as in situated planning) while allowing actions to be executed during ongoing planning.

- The solution extends prior work on metareasoning for situated temporal planning to decide when to dispatch actions. A new metareasoning model called CoPEM is proposed to account for the value of information from additional search.

- CoPEM yields an intractable POMDP, but provides insights into estimating the value of additional search vs immediately dispatching an action. These insights are used to develop a decision rule for dispatching actions in the situated temporal planner.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the problem of concurrent planning and execution, addressing limitations of prior situated planning formulations
- Develops the CoPEM metareasoning model to account for value of information in the concurrent setting
- Integrates insights from CoPEM into a decision rule and modifications to the situated temporal planner to enable concurrent planning and execution
- Empirical evaluation shows the approach outperforms situated temporal planning given tight deadlines and time pressure

The key significance is extending situated temporal planning to allow action dispatch during ongoing search, better handling problems where deadlines are too tight to complete planning first. The metareasoning insights and planner integration provide a principled way to make action dispatch decisions within the planning process.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new problem setting called concurrent planning and execution where actions can be executed before a complete plan is found, extending prior work on situated temporal planning, and presents an algorithm that decides whether to dispatch an action or continue search based on estimating the probability of success.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new problem setting called "concurrent planning and execution", where actions can be dispatched (executed) before the planner has found a complete plan. The key differences from prior work are:

1) It handles wall clock deadlines that affect action applicability and goal achievement (as in situated planning), while also allowing dispatching actions before a complete plan is found.

2) It extends previous metareasoning work for situated temporal planning to develop an algorithm for making decisions about whether to search more or dispatch an action. 

3) It presents a new metareasoning model called CoPEM that accounts for the value of information from additional search, and uses insights from this model to develop the dispatch decision rule.

4) It empirically evaluates the approach on planning problems with time pressure, showing that allowing concurrent planning and execution outperforms situated temporal planning when deadlines are very tight.

In summary, the key contribution is defining and providing an algorithmic solution for the new problem setting of concurrent planning and execution under tight deadlines.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Concurrent planning and execution
- Situated temporal planning
- Metareasoning
- Value of information
- Dispatching actions
- Time pressure
- Deadlines
- Probabilistic performance profiles
- Decision rules
- Real-world execution

The paper introduces a new problem formulation called "concurrent planning and execution", which allows dispatching actions for execution before a complete plan is found, unlike previous situated temporal planning approaches. It develops a metareasoning model called CoPEM to make decisions about dispatching actions or gathering more information by searching further. The key ideas involve estimating the value of dispatching an action early versus continuing to search based on probabilistic estimates of success. The approach is evaluated on planning problems with tight deadlines simulating time pressure, and shown to outperform situated temporal planning that must find a complete plan before executing any action. The end goal is to integrate this concurrent planning and execution approach with real-world robotic systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new problem setting called "concurrent planning and execution". How is this setting different from prior work on situated temporal planning? What key capability does it add?

2. The paper builds upon a situated temporal planner that uses rational metareasoning. Briefly explain the metareasoning approach used in that planner and its limitations when extended to concurrent planning and execution. 

3. The paper presents a new metareasoning model called CoPEM. How does CoPEM differ from the prior CoPE model? What issue with CoPE does it aim to address? 

4. Walk through the formal definition of the CoPEM model. What are the key components it models compared to CoPE? How does it account for the value of information from additional search?

5. Explain the basic tractable case for CoPEM that assumes known induced deadlines and no further information from computations. How is this case leveraged towards a practical algorithm?

6. Describe the scheme presented to handle the CoPEM case with bounded additional measurements and dispatch decisions. What is the complexity of this scheme and why can't it be used directly in practice?  

7. What specific approximations and simplifying assumptions were made in the planner implementation for estimating the probability of success of different dispatch options?

8. Explain the dispatch decision rules used during search to determine when an action should be dispatched. What practical issues do they aim to address?

9. What modifications were made to the planner's state space representation and search process to enable concurrent planning and execution?

10. Summarize the key results from the empirical evaluation. In what situations does concurrent planning and execution offer benefits over situated temporal planning? When does its advantage decrease?
