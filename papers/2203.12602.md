# [VideoMAE: Masked Autoencoders are Data-Efficient Learners for   Self-Supervised Video Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12602)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we effectively pre-train video transformers in a self-supervised manner to learn good spatiotemporal representations from video data itself without relying on extra labeled image data?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes VideoMAE, a self-supervised video pre-training method based on masked autoencoding. 

- It introduces customized designs like tube masking with extremely high ratios to make the video reconstruction task more challenging and meaningful.

- This approach allows pre-training video transformers like ViT on the video dataset itself without extra labeled image data.

- VideoMAE shows that masked autoencoding is an effective self-supervised pre-training paradigm for video transformers to learn good spatiotemporal representations from videos.

- It demonstrates VideoMAE is a data-efficient learner, allowing effective pre-training with only thousands of videos.

- The learned representations transfer well to downstream tasks like action classification and detection.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a well-designed masked autoencoder like VideoMAE can serve as an effective self-supervised pre-training approach for video transformers to learn spatiotemporal representations directly from videos without reliance on extra labeled image data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing VideoMAE, a self-supervised video pre-training method based on masked autoencoders. This is the first work to show that masked autoencoders can be effective for pre-training video transformers.

- Introducing two key designs for VideoMAE - using an extremely high masking ratio (90-95%) and tube masking to deal with temporal redundancy and correlation in videos. These make the pre-training task more challenging.

- Demonstrating that VideoMAE is a data-efficient learner, allowing transformers to be pre-trained effectively from only a few thousand video clips, without any extra data.

- Showing that VideoMAE outperforms training from scratch and contrastive pre-training methods like MoCo v3 when pre-training transformers on video datasets.

- Finding that data quality/domain shift matters more than quantity for self-supervised video pre-training. VideoMAE pre-trained on source data works better than transferring from other larger datasets.

- Achieving new state-of-the-art results on Something-Something V2 (75.4%), UCF101 (91.3%), and HMDB51 (62.6%) using only the raw video clips, without any extra data or labels during pre-training.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a simple but effective masked autoencoder approach (VideoMAE) to enable self-supervised pre-training of video transformers in a data-efficient manner. The customized designs address challenges of temporal redundancy and correlation in videos.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VideoMAE, a self-supervised video pre-training method based on masked autoencoders that allows training vanilla vision transformers effectively and efficiently from only a few thousand video clips without any extra data.
