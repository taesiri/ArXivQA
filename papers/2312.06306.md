# [Attribute Annotation and Bias Evaluation in Visual Datasets for   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06306)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents a new methodology and annotation tool to analyze bias and fairness in commonly used visual datasets for training perception and prediction systems in autonomous vehicles. The authors annotated intrinsic attributes like age, gender, skin tone and transport mode for over 90,000 people, and vehicle type, color and segment for over 50,000 vehicles across 6 popular AV datasets. They proposed an annotation procedure involving multiple annotators labeling the same subsets of data to measure inter-rater agreement, developing guidelines to reduce discrepancies. Agreement was fair to excellent per the computed Fleissâ€™ Kappa metric. The analysis exposed severely underrepresented groups like children (1% samples), dark skin tone (up to 18% in US datasets vs over 60% light skin), wheelchair users and personal mobility devices (<1%), and vehicle types besides cars constituting 15-35%. It also revealed biases towards males (55% vs 35% females). The work enables future examinations of model performance across demographic groups to uncover algorithmic biases. The tool, scripts and label distributions are publicly hosted to facilitate fairness evaluations of perception systems, addressing the often overlooked topic of equity in autonomous driving research.
