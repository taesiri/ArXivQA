# [Online and Certifiably Correct Visual Odometry and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05254)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper addresses the problem of certified perception for safety-critical robotic applications. Specifically, the goal is to develop algorithms that can provide reliable estimates of the robot's pose (position and orientation) as well as maps representing obstacles in the environment, along with provable bounds on the errors. 

- This is important because existing visual odometry and mapping algorithms provide best-estimate outputs without quantifying the errors. However, for safety-critical planning and control, it is crucial to have certified error bounds from the perception system to guarantee safety.

Proposed Solution
- The paper proposes two new algorithms:
  1) Certified Visual Odometry (C-VO): Estimates pose between successive camera frames along with error bounds on both rotation and translation. Adapts a robust pointcloud registration method and uses geometric properties to derive the error bounds.

  2) Certified Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (C-ESDF): Constructs a map of the environment as a signed distance field, which stores distance to the nearest obstacle at each point. Deflates the ESDF over time based on the C-VO error bounds to ensure the map always safely underestimates obstacle distances.

- Together, these two algorithms provide the necessary certified estimates of robot pose and maps for safety-critical planning and control. The error bounds from C-VO are designed to integrate cleanly with the C-ESDF deflation approach.

Main Contributions
- The key contributions are:
  1) Novel C-VO algorithm providing certified rotation and translation error bounds in real-time 
  2) Novel C-ESDF mapping approach that uses C-VO bounds to deflate so map always underestimates distances
  3) Integrated perception solution addressing the problem of certified estimates for safety-critical applications
  4) Experiments showing real-time performance of 30 FPS for both algorithms

- To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first solution able to certify the outputs of a visual odometry and Euclidean signed distance field mapping pipeline.

In summary, the paper makes important progress towards enabling certifiably correct perception for safety-critical robots by proposing novel algorithms for certified visual odometry and mapping as an integrated pipeline.
