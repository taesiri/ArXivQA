# [Adaptive Annotation Distribution for Weakly Supervised Point Cloud   Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06259)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Adaptive Annotation Distribution Network (AADNet) for weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation. It introduces a probability density analysis to show the impact of non-uniform sparse annotation distributions compared to uniform distributions. Based on this analysis, AADNet has two main components - 1) a label-aware point cloud downsampling strategy (LaDS) that increases the number of annotations used for training while retaining structural diversity, and 2) a multiplicative dynamic entropy module with asynchronous training (MDE-AT) that handles non-uniform distributions, corrects gradient bias, and reduces epistemic uncertainty explicitly. Evaluations show that without relying on any additional restrictions or information, AADNet achieves consistent performance gains across S3DIS, ScanNetV2 and SemanticKITTI datasets for both uniform and non-uniform sparse annotation scenarios, especially for extreme sparsity levels (0.01%). It demonstrates strong generalizability across backbones. Thus AADNet advances the state-of-the-art for weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation under real-world conditions with diverse annotation distributions. The analysis and method provide new insights for handling non-ideal sparse annotations effectively in 3D scene understanding.
