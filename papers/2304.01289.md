# [Monocular 3D Object Detection with Bounding Box Denoising in 3D by   Perceiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01289)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can monocular 3D object detection be improved by leveraging both bottom-up and top-down information flows? 

Specifically, the authors observe that existing monocular 3D detectors rely solely on bottom-up paradigms to directly predict 3D boxes from a single image. However, they show through experiments that these bottom-up detectors can serve as strong priors that, when combined with simple top-down sampling strategies, lead to significant performance gains. 

The key hypothesis is that combining these bottom-up and top-down information flows in a stage-wise manner - initial bottom-up proposals followed by top-down refinement - can improve monocular 3D detection accuracy, especially for localizing the 3D box centers.

To validate this, the authors propose MonoXiver, a refinement module that generates 3D proposal anchors based on initial bottom-up detectors, and then verifies/denoises the proposals using a Perceiver model that encodes both 3D geometric and 2D appearance features. Experiments on KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate consistent improvements across different base detectors.

In summary, the central research question is how to effectively integrate bottom-up and top-down paradigms for improving monocular 3D detection, with the key hypothesis being that a stage-wise approach can combine their complementary strengths. MonoXiver is presented as a way to validate this hypothesis.
