# [UniGen: A Unified Generative Framework for Retrieval and Question   Answering with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative information retrieval encompasses two major tasks - Generative Document Retrieval (GDR) and Grounded Answer Generation (GAR). 
- Existing methods rely on separate retrieval and reader modules for these tasks, which hinders simultaneous optimization.

Proposed Solution - UniGen:  
- Presents a unified generative framework that integrates retrieval and QA into a single model with a shared encoder and two decoders.
- Introduces "connectors" generated by large language models (LLMs) to bridge gaps between queries, documents and answers:
   - Q-Connector enriches query context
   - D-Connector refines document content
- Proposes an iterative enhancement strategy to improve both tasks using generated answers and retrieved docs.

Key Contributions:
- Unified Generative Framework: Incorporates a multi-decoder structure to learn retrieval and QA simultaneously.
- LLM-enhanced Connectors: Q and D connectors establish connections to enhance query semantics and document content.
- Iterative Enhancement Strategy: Uses generated answers and retrieved docs iteratively to improve model input.

Experiments conducted on MS MARCO and Natural Questions datasets demonstrate UniGen's superior performance on both retrieval and QA tasks compared to existing methods. The iterative strategy also consistently improves performance.
