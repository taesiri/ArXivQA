# [Assume-Guarantee Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper on assume-guarantee reinforcement learning:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of designing controllers for large-scale systems that consist of multiple interacting components. Specifically, the goal is to satisfy a global temporal logic specification over the joint behavior of the components. However, designing centralized controllers requires complete knowledge about all components, making it infeasible. On the other hand, designing distributed controllers without considering interactions between components can lead to violation of the global specification. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents an assume-guarantee reinforcement learning approach. The key idea is to design a local controller for each component by making assumptions about the behaviors of other interacting components and providing guarantees about their own behavior. These assume-guarantee contracts are expressed as regular languages. Scalar rewards are automatically constructed from these contracts and used in reinforcement learning. By solving a Markov game for each contract, the paper shows theoretically that combining local satisfaction probabilities provides a lower bound on satisfying the global specification.

Key Contributions:
1) A novel formulation of assume-guarantee contracts as regular languages that enable modular reinforcement learning
2) Automatic translation of these contracts to scalar rewards for reinforcement learning agents 
3) A Markov game formulation to compute optimal policies for each agent maximizing local satisfaction probabilities
4) Theoretical results showing that combining local satisfaction probabilities provides global guarantees 
5) Experimental evaluation on multi-agent grid worlds, room temperature control and traffic light control demonstrating efficiency over centralized approaches

In summary, the paper presents a principled assume-guarantee reinforcement learning approach to decompose a complex control problem over many interacting components. By providing theoretical guarantees on global satisfaction from local computations, the method scales significantly better compared to centralized approaches.
