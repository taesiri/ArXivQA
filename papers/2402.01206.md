# [Comparative Evaluation of Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Accurate weather forecasting, especially for precipitation and temperature patterns, is critical for effective resource management and disaster preparedness. However, the complex and chaotic nature of meteorological variables makes reliable prediction challenging. 

Solution: This paper explores the application of various machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Stacking Random Forest, and Stacking Neural Network for long-term precipitation and temperature forecasting using 20 years of weather data from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Data: The dataset comprises 16 features including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, surface pressure etc. It is split into training (85%) and test (15%) sets.

Methods: Six ML algorithms are trained on the data to predict average temperature and precipitation. Their performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Correlation analysis and data visualization are also conducted.  

Key Results: 
- AdaBoost achieves the best accuracy of 92.51% for precipitation forecasting. All algorithms have comparable performance.
- For temperature prediction, AdaBoost again performs the best with 91.7% accuracy. 
- Precipitation correlates highly with humidity variables while temperature correlates with wet point and specific humidity.  
- Monthly distribution shows precipitation and temperature peak in the middle of the year.

Main Contributions:
- First study analyzing 20 years of granular weather data from Dhaka using advanced ML techniques
- Quantifies algorithm performance for temperature and precipitation forecasting
- Identifies highly correlated variables for the two prediction tasks  
- Provides benchmark for future research directions like ensemble methods, feature engineering, domain adaptation etc.

In summary, this study demonstrates how modern ML algorithms can enable robust weather forecasting, laying the foundation for further enhancements. Granular analysis of long-term data uncovers insights for the Dhaka region.
