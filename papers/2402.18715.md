# [Commonsense Ontology Micropatterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18715)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neurosymbolic AI systems aim to mimic human transfer learning and analogy making abilities to achieve general AI. Modular ontology modeling (MOMo) is one proposed approach to enable this.
- However, a key bottleneck is the limited availability of ready-to-use ontology design patterns (ODPs) to serve as the building blocks. 
- At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have become a rich source of commonsense knowledge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using LLMs to automatically generate commonsense ODPs representing frequently occurring nouns. 
- 104 common nouns are selected and used to prompt an LLM to generate candidate ODPs.
- Various prompt formulations are used to elicit multiple ODP options per noun.
- Heuristics consolidate the candidates into 104 final ODPs called "commonsense micropatterns".

Key Contributions:
- Methodology to automatically elicit commonsense ODPs from LLMs for arbitrary nouns
- Set of 104 commonsense micropatterns covering frequently occurring nouns
- Organization of patterns into a Modular Ontology Design Library (MODL) called CS-MODL
- Makes CS-MODL and all artifacts (prompts, responses, scripts) freely available to enable extension and reuse
- Demonstrates feasibility of using LLMs to accelerate ontology development in support of modular ontology modeling

In summary, the paper introduces an approach to automatically generate commonsense ontology design patterns using LLMs to address the lack of readily available building blocks for modular ontology modeling. The methodology, design library and associated resources produced enable wider adoption of modular techniques for assembling knowledge graphs.
