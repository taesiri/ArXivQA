# [Bring Your Own Character: A Holistic Solution for Automatic Facial   Animation Generation of Customized Characters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Creating facial animations for virtual characters is challenging. Current methods either require expensive motion capture devices or significant manual effort from animators. Existing solutions are also often coupled to specific character rigs, limiting flexibility for customized characters. 

Proposed Solution: This paper presents a holistic solution to automatically generate facial animations for customized virtual characters. The key components are:

1) A deep learning model to retarget facial expressions by estimating blendshape coefficients of input face images. This allows animating characters with varying appearances and blendshape topologies. The model has a base network to extract 3D face parameters and an adapter network to estimate blendshape weights.

2) A Unity toolkit that encapsulates the model and provides interfaces for animation generation, visualization, adjustment and export. It accepts image/video input to drive characters. The toolkit incorporates human-in-the-loop through online tuning of animations and offline model tuning.

3) Evaluations of the model accuracy and toolkit usability. Experiments showed the model can support characters with different textures and topologies. The toolkit was easy to use and animations had higher quality when incorporating human feedback.

Main Contributions:

- Deep learning based facial retargeting to customize blendshape coefficients
- Unity toolkit for convenient animation generation and human-in-the-loop
- Flexibility in supporting varying character textures and topologies 
- Quantitative model accuracy analysis and qualitative animation assessments
- Usability evaluation of toolkit functionalities and human-in-the-loop modes

The solution has the potential to assist animators by automatically generating facial animations tailored to customized virtual characters. Code is public to facilitate future research.
