# [Instability of the solitary waves for the Generalized   Benjamin-Bona-Mahony Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is proving the orbital instability of solitary wave solutions to the generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (gBBM) equation in the critical frequency case. The gBBM equation is:$$\partial_t u+\partial_x u+\partial_x(|u|^pu)-\partial_t \partial_x^{2}u=0$$It has solitary wave solutions of the form $\phi_c(x-ct)$ for wave speeds $c>1$. Prior work showed that for $p>4$, there is a critical wave speed $c_0(p)$ such that:- For $c>c_0(p)$, the solitary waves are orbitally stable - For $1<c<c_0(p)$, the solitary waves are orbitally unstableThe stability in the critical case $c=c_0(p)$ was unknown. This paper aims to prove that the solitary waves are orbitally unstable at the critical speed, thus completing the stability picture. The key hypothesis the authors need to prove instability is that the second variation (Hessian) of the action functional has a negative direction at $c=c_0(p)$. They verify this numerically. With this hypothesis, they are able to construct a monotonicity argument leading to the orbital instability result.So in summary, the main research question is proving instability of gBBM solitary waves at the critical speed $c=c_0(p)$, based on the hypothesis that the Hessian has a negative direction which is confirmed numerically. The instability result fills the last gap in the stability theory for these waves.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper studies the instability of solitary wave solutions for the generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (gBBM) equation in 1D. The key contributions are:1. It completes the stability theory of solitary waves for the gBBM equation by addressing the last remaining critical case where the second derivative of the action functional vanishes. 2. It proves the orbital instability of solitary waves in the critical frequency case, i.e. when the wave speed c equals c_0(p), through constructing a monotonic quantity based on localized virial identities and modulation analysis.3. The proof involves overcoming significant challenges posed by the non-onto property of the skew-symmetric operator in the gBBM equation. New techniques are introduced such as finding suitable pre-images for key terms and verifying a negative direction assumption numerically.4. The coercivity of the Hessian of the action is analyzed via spectral decomposition. Estimates on the modulation parameters are derived using the equation's Hamiltonian structure.5. A monotonic function is constructed by combining the modulation parameters, a localized virial functional, and the Hessian's spectral properties. Its positivity and coercivity lead to the instability result.In summary, this paper makes an important contribution by fully resolving the stability theory of solitary waves for the gBBM equation. The techniques introduced to handle the critical case enrich the analysis of stability for dispersive PDEs with poor Hamiltonian structure.
