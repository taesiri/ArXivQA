# [INEXA: Interactive and Explainable Process Model Abstraction Through   Object-Centric Process Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Process events are recorded at different granularity levels in multiple information systems. Existing process discovery techniques operate on these event logs directly and are not able to handle the differences in granularity.
- Existing event abstraction methods preprocess the logs to handle different granularities. However, they have limitations:
  1) The determined abstraction level binds all subsequent analysis steps, limiting interactivity
  2) They do not allow directly abstracting patterns in the process model
  3) They do not trace the analysis journey for explainability
- Existing process model abstraction methods also have limitations:
  1) Limited interactivity in exploring different abstraction levels 
  2) Only restricted tracing of the analysis journey, limiting explainability
  3) Abstracted models disconnect the log and model, preventing log replay

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose INEXA, an interactive and explainable process model abstraction method that maintains the link between log and model
- INEXA first discovers a process model on the original log. Then it applies model abstractions to the process model to abstract control flow patterns.
- The applied abstractions are traced by adding "abstraction objects" to the log instead of modifying events. This keeps the original log unchanged.
- An abstraction history object traces the sequence of applied abstractions. Together with the abstraction objects, this enables reconstructing the abstracted model from the original model and log.
- This "log-model link" is the core concept that enables interactivity to explore granularity levels by applying/undoing abstractions, while maintaining explainability.

Main Contributions:
- Novel concept of a log-model link that mirrors model abstractions on the log through abstraction objects and a history object
- Set of model abstractions focusing on control flow structures and interactions
- Interactive interface with apply, redo and export operations that enable exploring granularity levels
- Explainable abstraction journey stored in the log traceable through abstraction objects 
- Evaluation on a real manufacturing process event log demonstrating applicability

In summary, the paper proposes an interactive and explainable process model abstraction technique called INEXA to explore granularity levels in a process model while tracing the abstractions in the corresponding event log. This enables interactivity as well as explainability of the analysis journey.
