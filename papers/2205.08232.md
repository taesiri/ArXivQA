# [LogicSolver: Towards Interpretable Math Word Problem Solving with   Logical Prompt-enhanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08232)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that incorporating logical reasoning into math word problem (MWP) solving models can make them more interpretable and accurate. 

The key points are:

- Current MWP solving models rely on pattern matching and lack grounded mathematical reasoning, making them uninterpretable "black boxes". 

- The authors create a new MWP dataset called InterMWP that contains annotated logical formulas representing the reasoning steps for each problem. 

- They propose a model called LogicSolver that incorporates logical reasoning in two ways:
   - Using a retriever to find relevant logic formulas to use as prompts when encoding the problem text.
   - Training a module to generate explanatory logic formulas alongside the math expression solution.

- Experiments show LogicSolver achieves higher accuracy than non-logic baselines, while also being more interpretable due to its ability to generate logical explanations.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that incorporating logical reasoning into MWP solvers, both through prompting and explicit formula generation, can make the models more accurate and interpretable. The InterMWP dataset and LogicSolver model provide evidence to support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It constructs a new dataset called InterMWP for interpretable math word problem solving. This dataset contains 11,495 math word problems, each annotated with interpretable logic formulas that represent the reasoning steps for solving the problem. 

2. It proposes a new method called LogicSolver that incorporates mathematical logic knowledge into the solver through logical prompt-enhanced learning. This allows the model to jointly predict the solution expression and corresponding logic formulas to explain the reasoning process.

3. Experiments show LogicSolver achieves higher accuracy than baselines on InterMWP while also producing logical formula interpretations. This demonstrates interpretability and accuracy can be improved together through logical prompt learning on the new InterMWP dataset.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing a new interpretable math dataset, a logical prompt learning method to inject logic knowledge, and showing jointly improved accuracy and interpretability on this dataset. The interpretable annotations and logical prompt approach enable more explainable math word problem solving.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in math word problem solving:

- It focuses on improving the interpretability of math word problem solvers, which has received less attention compared to improving accuracy. Many existing papers focus only on getting the numeric answer correct.

- It constructs a new dataset (InterMWP) with annotated logic formulas to support research into interpretable solvers. Most existing datasets only have numeric answers as the target output.

- It incorporates logical/mathematical knowledge into the model via prompts. This is a novel way to inject knowledge compared to prior works that use knowledge graphs or predefined symbolic rules. 

- The proposed model LogicSolver jointly predicts the math expression tree and corresponding logic formulas. Most prior works only predict the expression tree.

- Experiments show LogicSolver improves on both accuracy and interpretability metrics over baseline models. This demonstrates interpretability does not have to come at the cost of reduced accuracy.

Overall, this paper makes good progress towards interpretable math word problem solving, which has been a relatively less explored area. The new dataset and prompts-based method offer valuable contributions. Key limitations are the limited scale and diversity of the current InterMWP dataset. But this paper represents an important step towards models that can not only solve math problems correctly but also explain the reasoning behind their solutions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

- Expanding the InterMWP dataset with more logic formulas to cover more real-world cases. The current set of 210 formulas is limited. 

- Improving performance on problems with long expression trees. Longer expressions are more challenging for both models and humans. Developing methods to handle longer expressions would be valuable.

- Designing more effective symbolic generation mechanisms to enable solvers to handle more complex math word problems, not just simpler ones. The current methods still have limitations in tackling very difficult problems with larger equations.

- Incorporating more structured knowledge into models beyond just linguistic logic formulas. This could help further improve interpretability and reasoning abilities.

- Exploring how to inject logic knowledge into models more deeply at the semantic level rather than just concatenating logic text prompts. This could lead to better utilization of logic knowledge.

- Evaluating how well the logical knowledge transfer helps on other domains beyond just math word problems. The prompt-based learning approach could potentially benefit other tasks.

- Developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy to better measure model interpretability and reasoning. This could drive further progress.

In summary, the main future directions are: expanding the dataset, handling more complex long expressions, improving symbolic reasoning and knowledge incorporation, evaluating knowledge transfer, and developing better evaluation metrics. Overall, there are still many opportunities to enhance model interpretability, reasoning, and generalization abilities for math word problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an interpretable math word problem (MWP) solving method called LogicSolver. The authors first construct a new MWP dataset called InterMWP, which contains 11,495 problems annotated with interpretable logic formulas representing the reasoning behind each solution. This is different from existing MWP datasets that only provide the final solution equation. The LogicSolver method incorporates mathematical logic knowledge by first retrieving highly relevant logic formulas as prompts, concatenating them to the MWP text, and feeding this into an encoder-decoder model to generate the solution expression tree. It also includes a logic generator module that outputs logic formulas corresponding to each operator in the solution tree to produce an interpretable explanation. Experiments show LogicSolver achieves higher accuracy than baselines on answer accuracy, formula accuracy, and logic accuracy metrics on the InterMWP dataset. The results demonstrate LogicSolver's stronger interpretability through logic formulas while also improving math problem solving accuracy using logic prompt learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a new interpretable math word problem (MWP) dataset called InterMWP and a framework named LogicSolver for generating explainable solutions to MWPs. InterMWP consists of 11,495 MWPs where each solution equation is annotated with interpretable logic formulas representing the grounded mathematical logic. This allows models trained on InterMWP to output logic formulas along with the solution expression. LogicSolver incorporates mathematical logic knowledge by first retrieving highly correlated logic formulas as prompts to improve the semantic representation of the MWP. The enhanced representation allows LogicSolver to generate both the solution expression and logic formulas explaining each operation in the expression. Experiments show LogicSolver achieves higher accuracy than baselines on InterMWP while also producing formula-based explanations for its solutions. 

The key contributions are the construction of the InterMWP dataset to facilitate research into interpretable MWP solvers, and the LogicSolver framework which leverages logical prompts to achieve higher accuracy and generate logical explanations. The results demonstrate improved performance over baselines on answer accuracy, formula accuracy and logic accuracy. This represents an advance towards building MWP solvers that are not only accurate but also interpretable.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is logical prompt-enhanced learning for interpretable math word problem solving. The authors propose a framework called LogicSolver which consists of three main components:

1. A logic formula retriever, which extracts logic formulas highly correlated with the math word problem (MWP) and passes them to the encoder-decoder model as logical prompts. 

2. An encoder-decoder model, which takes the MWP text concatenated with the logic prompts as input, and generates the solution expression tree as output.

3. A logic generator, which takes the operator nodes in the generated expression tree and predicts which logic formula can best explain the reasoning behind generating that operator. 

The key idea is to use relevant mathematical logic knowledge in the form of textual prompts to enhance the semantic representation of the MWP text. This allows the model to better ground its reasoning, and output a solution expression along with logical formulas that explain the reasoning behind each operator. The logic formulas come from an annotated dataset called InterMWP constructed by the authors. Experiments show this logical prompt-enhanced learning approach improves accuracy and interpretability compared to strong baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of interpretability in math word problem solving using neural networks. Specifically:

- Math word problem solving with neural networks has made great progress in terms of answer accuracy. However, these models rely on shallow heuristics and lack grounded mathematical reasoning, making them uninterpretable black boxes. 

- There is a lack of relevant and easily exploitable interpretable math word problem datasets to develop more interpretable models.

- The paper proposes to address these issues by:

1) Constructing a new interpretable math word problem dataset called InterMWP, where each problem is annotated with interpretable logic formulas representing the mathematical reasoning. 

2) Developing a model called LogicSolver that incorporates mathematical logic knowledge through logical prompts to improve problem understanding and generate interpretable logical formulas along with the solution expression.

In summary, the key issue being addressed is improving the interpretability of neural network models for math word problem solving by incorporating mathematical logic knowledge into the models and leveraging a new dataset with annotated logical formulas. The paper aims to take a step towards more interpretable models that can provide grounded explanations.
