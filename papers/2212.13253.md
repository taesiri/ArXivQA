# [DSI2I: Dense Style for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13253)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to represent and transfer style in a fine-grained, spatially-varying manner for exemplar-based image-to-image translation without paired data or semantic supervision during training. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Modeling style densely as a spatial map instead of a global feature vector will allow for finer control over stylistic attributes and better preservation of semantics during translation. 

2) Adversarial and perceptual losses can encourage disentanglement of dense style and content representations without supervision.

3) Semantic correspondence between source and exemplar images can be used to spatially warp the dense style map to match the layout of the source image content.

4) Evaluating stylistic similarity in a localized, class-wise manner better captures the benefits of dense style modeling compared to global image-level metrics.

The overall goal is to develop an unpaired, unsupervised image translation method that can adopt the fine-grained style of a target exemplar image while preserving source content, without relying on semantic labels or ground truth pairs during training. The central hypothesis is that dense style modeling along with the other proposed techniques can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a dense style representation for unpaired exemplar-based image-to-image translation (UEI2I). This allows for finer-grained control over style transfer compared to methods that use a global style vector. 

2. It shows that adversarial and perceptual losses can encourage disentanglement of the dense style and content representations during training, without requiring semantic labels.

3. It develops a cross-domain semantic correspondence module to warp the exemplar's dense style to align with the spatial structure of the source image content. This allows the exemplar's style to be transferred to semantically similar regions in the source image.

4. It introduces a localized style metric to quantitatively measure the similarity between the style of the translated image and the exemplar image on a per-class basis. 

5. Experiments demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the proposed method can produce image translations that are more diverse and stylistically closer to the exemplars compared to global style methods, while preserving fidelity.

In summary, the key novelty is the formulation of a dense style representation for UEI2I that provides spatial control over style transfer, without semantic supervision during training. The cross-domain warping and localized evaluation metric are also contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for unpaired image-to-image translation that represents image style densely using a feature map with the same spatial resolution as the content, and uses perceptual and adversarial losses to disentangle style and content, allowing for finer-grained control over style transfer without sacrificing content fidelity.
