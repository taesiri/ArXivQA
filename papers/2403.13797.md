# [Bridge the Modality and Capacity Gaps in Vision-Language Model Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13797)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of selecting the most suitable pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) from a diverse VLM zoo for a given image classification dataset, using only the textual data (class names) of the target dataset. This is referred to as Language-Only VLM Selection (LOVM). Two key challenges in LOVM are analyzed:

1) Modality gap: The features extracted by VLMs for images vs texts cluster into two distinct groups, making text a poor substitute for images when estimating a VLM's image classification capability.  

2) Capacity gap: A VLM's overall performance averaged across datasets does not accurately reflect its performance on a specific target dataset. So selecting VLMs based on general strength is ineffective.

Solution - SWAB:
The paper proposes a method called SWAB (VLM Selection With Gap Bridging) to address both gaps in LOVM and improve VLM selection. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a transport matrix using optimal transport to capture semantic similarity between classes of target dataset and open datasets.  

2) Use this matrix to transfer useful class-level statistics of VLMs like modality gap vectors and rankings from open datasets to the target dataset. This helps estimate these statistics for the target dataset.

3) Bridge modality gap: Use transferred gap vectors to modify text features and make them better proxies for images. Improves text-classification based VLM ranking prediction.  

4) Bridge capacity gap: Use transferred VLM rankings to better predict dataset-specific rankings.

5) Ensemble the two ranking predictions to select the best VLM.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and analyze the modality gap and capacity gap as key challenges in LOVM
- Propose SWAB method to mitigate negative impacts of both gaps 
- Use optimal transport to transfer useful VLM statistics between datasets
- Demonstrate improved VLM selection performance across variety of models and datasets

In summary, the paper provides an effective solution called SWAB to address gaps in cross-modal VLM selection using only language data of target dataset. The use of optimal transport and ensemble technique leads to significantly better VLM recommendations.
