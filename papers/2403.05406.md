# [Considering Nonstationary within Multivariate Time Series with   Variational Hierarchical Transformer for Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05406)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Forecasting of multivariate time series (MTS) is challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, inherent stochasticity, and non-stationarity issues. 
- Previous works adopt stationarization methods to attenuate non-stationarity, but this ignores inherent non-stationarity and causes over-stationarization problems.
- Deterministic Transformer models also face difficulties in modeling complex real-world MTS distributions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Hierarchical Time Series Variational Transformer (HTV-Trans) to tackle non-stationarity and stochasticity in MTS forecasting.
- It consists of a Hierarchical Time Series Probabilistic Generative Module (HTPGM) combined with a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture.
- HTPGM uses a hierarchical variational autoencoder structure to capture multi-scale non-stationary characteristics and stochasticity. 
- Transformer leverages the HTPGM outputs for enhanced representation learning.
- An autoencoding inference scheme with combined prediction and reconstruction loss is used.

Main Contributions:
- HTPGM avoids over-stationarization by recovering non-stationary information into model, providing multi-scale generative representations.
- HTV-Trans couples the complementary strengths of HTPGM and Transformer for modeling complex MTS distributions and dependencies.  
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on various MTS datasets, proving benefits of handling non-stationarity and stochasticity.
- Ablation studies demonstrate contribution of each component of the proposed approach.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and empirical contributions in MTS forecasting by effectively tackling non-stationarity and uncertainty via the proposed HTV-Trans framework.
