# [Thousands of AI Authors on the Future of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of consensus and high uncertainty among AI experts regarding the future progress and impact of artificial intelligence. However, their judgments are important for navigating policy decisions about AI.

- Previous surveys of AI experts' views had limited sample sizes of a few hundred participants.

Solution:
- The authors conducted a large-scale survey of 2,778 AI researchers who recently published papers at top AI conferences.

- The survey asked about predictions related to the pace of progress, likelihood of key milestones, potential for exponential acceleration, and social impacts of advanced AI systems.

Key Results:  
- On average, AI milestones are expected 1 year earlier compared to forecasts from a similar 2022 survey. Several economically valuable tasks like automating certain jobs or generating realistic media are now expected before 2030.

- Despite shifts in timelines, there is still substantial disagreement and uncertainty regarding most questions.

- 38-51% of participants estimate over 10% chance that advanced AI could cause human extinction, though there is no consensus it is likely.

- Most participants think AI progress and safety merits more research prioritization than currently, and risks like mass surveillance and inequality deserve serious concern.

Main Contributions:
- This survey provides an updated snapshot of expert views following a year of rapid public progress, captures a diversity of questions related to AI timelines and social impacts through well-designed methodology, and includes views from the largest sample of expert participants to date (over 10x more than previous surveys). Though views remain uncertain, tracking changes and variance can inform difficult judgment calls about navigating AI progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the results of a survey of over 2,700 AI researchers on their predictions regarding the pace of AI progress and potential social impacts of advanced AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents the results of a large survey of AI researchers on their predictions and views regarding the progress and impacts of artificial intelligence. The main contributions include:

1) It surveys 2,778 AI researchers who published peer-reviewed papers in 2022 at top AI conferences. This is the largest survey of AI researchers to date.

2) It tracks how AI progress predictions have changed over time by comparing to similar surveys conducted in 2016 and 2022. Many milestones are now expected earlier - for example, human-level machine intelligence is predicted 13 years earlier on average compared to 2022. 

3) It gathers AI researchers' views on potential risks and benefits of advanced AI systems. A majority assign substantial probability to extremely bad outcomes like human extinction, though views overall remain uncertain and complex.

4) It examines beliefs about an "intelligence explosion" - whether AI progress will dramatically accelerate. Median predictions have been remarkably stable since 2016, though most view the argument as broadly correct.

5) It includes new questions probing views on issues like AI system alignment, lack of explainability, races in AI capabilities, and how to balance openness and safety.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a comprehensive updated perspective on how leaders in AI view progress and impacts of the field, based on the largest expert survey to date. The results highlight increasing expectations for early capabilities but enduring uncertainty about long-term consequences.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper surveyed researchers who published in top AI conferences in 2022. What are some potential biases that could arise from only sampling researchers who published recently, compared to sampling more broadly across the field?

2. When asking about the timing of future AI capabilities, the survey used two framings: fixed years and fixed probabilities. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of each framing? How might the framings influence respondents' answers differently?  

3. The paper compares results on High-Level Machine Intelligence (HLMI) and Full Automation of Labor (FAOL) questions between survey waves. However, the questions differ in some potentially important ways beyond just task vs occupation framing. What are some other ways the questions differ that could explain the large gaps in timing predictions?

4. In the questions about extinction risk, how was "human extinction or similarly permanent and severe disempowerment" defined? What range of scenarios could respondents have considered for the latter clause? How might ambiguities in interpreting the question stem wording impact results?

5. The paper concludes that AI researchers believe there is a nontrivial risk of extinction from AI, but most gave this a median 5-10% probability. What considerations influence an expert making a quantitative judgment about an unprecedented event like AI-caused extinction?

6. The survey questions ask about feasibility or capability, not adoption or deployment. How might answers differ if the questions had instead asked "when will AI systems be widely deployed that..." rather than "when will it become feasible for AI systems to..."?  

7. The paper uses a weighted combination of the fixed years and fixed probabilities question framings. What would be the benefits/drawbacks of analyzing the results separately per framing instead? How could an unweighted ensemble approach retain more information?

8. How robust are the conclusions in this paper if restricted only to respondents from academia rather than industry? What differences might be expected between respondents from corporations versus universities?

9. The introduction mentions limitations of expert judgment. What calibration techniques could have been used to check for overconfidence among respondent forecasts for milestones? How might a calibration analysis influence interpretation of the aggregate predictions?

10. In the question about impacts of HLMI, respondents assign probabilities across a range of outcomes. How sensitive are the aggregated “extremely bad” probabilities to how bins/scenarios were defined and labeled? How comparable is this to questions framed directly about extinction probability?
