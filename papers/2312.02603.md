# [Automatic Robot Path Planning for Visual Inspection from Object Shape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02603)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an automatic robotic path planning approach for visual inspection tasks based solely on an object's geometry, without needing prior object models or training data. The method utilizes a single RGB-D camera mounted on a robot to capture point cloud data of the target object. The point cloud is processed to extract the object's 3D profile, which is then used to generate inspection path targets for the robot end-effector that follow the object's surface curvature and normal vectors. Both single-path and multi-path inspection plans can be produced depending on object size and shape complexity. The approach is evaluated in simulation and real-world experiments with varying objects, successfully demonstrating robotic motion execution to reach the computed inspection poses. A key advantage is the method's simplicity and ability to operate on standard hardware with just a single depth camera, while also being robot-agnostic. Limitations relate to stray points affecting target locations and missing surface details in some cases. Overall, the technique enables automated visual inspection path generation for unknown objects using only perceptual observations, with open-source code provided.
