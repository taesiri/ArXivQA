# [Beyond Joint Demonstrations: Personalized Expert Guidance for Efficient   Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08936)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in efficient exploration due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space. Prior works have shown that expert demonstrations can guide single-agent RL, but directly applying them to MARL is difficult since obtaining joint expert demonstrations that show collaborative behaviors is impractical. This paper asks: can we instead leverage more readily available "personalized" demonstrations that focus on individual agent behaviors to guide MARL?

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel MARL algorithm called Personalized Expert-guided MARL (PegMARL) that selectively utilizes personalized demonstrations to reshape rewards and guide exploration, while allowing agents to learn coordination. PegMARL has two discriminators - a "behavior" discriminator that matches state-action distribution to demonstrations, and a "dynamics" discriminator that checks if the demonstrations match the environment dynamics. The reshaped reward integrates outputs of both discriminators.

Main Contributions:

- First approach to enable personalized demonstrations for heterogeneous MARL, easily generalizable to varying numbers and types of agents

- PegMARL dynamically and selectively reshapes rewards using two discriminators to aid exploration in a general, plug-and-play manner

- Evaluated on discrete and continuous environments; outperforms SOTA MARL, imitation learning, and reward shaping baselines. Achieves near-optimal performance even with suboptimal demonstrations

- Also compatible with joint demonstrations, including non-co-trained ones. Experiments in StarCraft show PegMARL converges effectively when trained on non-co-trained joint demonstrations

In summary, PegMARL introduces a novel concept of personalized demonstrations for MARL and an effective algorithm to selectively leverage them to learn cooperative policies. Key advantages are generalizability, scalability and robustness.
