# [How Lexical is Bilingual Lexicon Induction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) aims to learn word translations between language pairs from monolingual corpora. It remains challenging, especially for low-resource languages, due to lack of data and lexical variation across languages.
- The hubness problem where certain words have dense clusters of potential translations makes disambiguation difficult. Recent methods using cross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE) alignments do not effectively address this.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose incorporating simple lexical features like part-of-speech (POS) tags and term frequencies to help with disambiguation. 
- They show higher POS and term frequency correlation exists between aligned language pairs using statistics on the XLING dataset.
- A retrieve-and-rerank framework is used. A CLWE model retrieves candidates, which are re-ranked using XLM-Roberta and gradient boosted decision trees with lexical features.

Main Contributions:
- Show higher correlation of POS tags and term frequencies between aligned language pairs.
- Propose a lexical-features boosted bilingual lexicon induction (LFBB) method to improve disambiguation.
- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on the XLING benchmark, improving accuracy by 2.75% on semi-supervised and 1.2% on supervised splits over previous best method.
- Demonstrate efficacy of using lexical features to address hubness issue and qualitatively analyze improvements.

In summary, the paper tackles BLI by using lexical features like POS and term frequencies to help disambiguate difficult cases. A retrieve-rank framework with gradient boosted decision trees modeling these features achieves new state-of-the-art on XLING dataset.
