# [Reframing Tax Law Entailment as Analogical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06715)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Statutory reasoning (applying laws to case facts) is an important legal task but lacks sufficient training data. 
- Prior work framed it as textual entailment with a small dataset (SARA).
- Consistency across cases is an important legal principle that is not captured when looking at cases in isolation.

Proposed Solution:
- Reframe statutory reasoning as an analogy task between pairs of statute-case mappings. 
- Generate a dataset of statute-case quadruples labeled as analogy/not analogy if the entailment labels match/differ.
- Test analogy methods like GPT-3.5, vector offsets, and classification models.
- Solve statutory reasoning by retrieving similar statute-case pairs and making entailment predictions based on analogy outcomes.

Key Contributions:
- Formulate statutory reasoning as an analogy task to increase data and incorporate consistency.
- Generate a dataset of 15K quadruples from 176 entailment samples.
- Show the analogy task is similarly challenging for models as the original task.
- Demonstrate an improvement in statutory reasoning using retrieval and analogy models over prior comparable methods.
- Provide some interpretability by surfacing similar cases and analogies to explain decisions.

In summary, the paper introduces a way to reframe statutory reasoning as analogy to expand the limited training data. Experiments show this is a challenging task for current models. Finally, a pipeline using retrieval and analogy predictions advances progress on the original statutory reasoning problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper reframes statutory reasoning in tax law as an analogy task by combining statute-case pairs into analogical quadruples, shows this task is roughly as difficult for NLP models, and demonstrates some progress on statutory reasoning itself by using retrieval mechanisms and analogy models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Reframing statutory reasoning as an analogy task by forming quadruples of statute-case pairs and labeling them as analogical or not. This increases the dataset size and introduces an element of interpretability.

2) Evaluating multiple methods, including powerful language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, on the analogy task and analyzing their capabilities and limitations.

3) Proposing an approach to solve statutory reasoning by retrieving similar cases and using analogy models to predict entailment labels. This combines retrieval mechanisms and analogy reasoning to provide a form of interpretability. 

4) Demonstrating some improvement over prior work on statutory reasoning, although not reaching statistical significance due to the small dataset size. The proposed retrieval + analogy approach has the potential to further improve performance.

In summary, the key contribution is reframing statutory reasoning as analogy to generate more data, evaluate analogy methods, and propose a retrieval + analogy approach that shows promise while also providing interpretability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes reframing statutory reasoning as an analogy task. What is the rationale behind this? How does forming analogies between statute-case pairs help capture useful similarities and differences compared to looking at cases in isolation?

2. The paper generates analogical quadruples from the SARA dataset. What strategies are used to create positive and negative examples? How is the dataset size expanded through this quadruple generation process?

3. The paper tests several methods, including GPT models and a vector offset method, on the analogy task. What are the key differences between these approaches and what insights do the results provide about the difficulty of analogical reasoning in this legal domain? 

4. For the vector offset method, both a quadruple approach and a pair approach are tested. What are the equations used in these two approaches and what do the results suggest about the utility of computing pairwise offsets?

5. The paper frames the analogy task as a binary classification problem and fine-tunes T5-Large. What input representation is used? What results are achieved compared to the vector offset baselines?

6. How is the trained analogy model adapted to solve the original statutory reasoning task? Explain the process of using retrieval to find similar cases and making entailment predictions based on analogy judgments. 

7. What retrieval mechanisms are explored and what impact does using different amounts of information from the statute+case pairs have on performance? How do the best results compare to prior work?

8. What patterns in GPT model behavior on the analogy task are identified through qualitative analysis? What limitations do the observations suggest about these models' reasoning capabilities? 

9. The discussion section mentions integrating better analogy models and retrieval methods. What specific approaches are suggested to improve performance? What other legal datasets could be leveraged to further assess effectiveness?

10. Beyond accuracy, what potential benefits does the proposed reframing of statutory reasoning as analogy provide in terms of interpretability or explainability? How could this advantage current pure machine learning approaches?
