# [Can Language Models Teach Weaker Agents? Teacher Explanations Improve   Students via Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09299)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can language models act as effective teachers for weaker agents by intervening with natural language explanations? More specifically, the authors investigate if, when, and how a teacher language model should intervene with explanations to improve a student language model's performance on reasoning tasks.The key aspects explored are:- If teacher language model interventions at test time can improve student model predictions (RQ1)- Given a budget on how many data points the teacher can intervene on, when the teacher should intervene to maximize student performance (RQ2) - How the teacher can personalize its explanations for a particular student model using theory of mind, in order to generate more helpful explanations (RQ3)- If the teacher's explanations generalize and improve the student's performance on future unexplained data points (RQ4)So in summary, the central research question examines the ability of teacher language models to improve student language models through personalized and selectively-timed explanation interventions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a student-teacher framework to evaluate whether language model teachers can improve student language models through natural language explanations. The key findings are:1. Teacher language models can intervene at test time with explanations to improve student model performance on reasoning tasks. More intervention leads to better student performance, though human teachers are still better. 2. Teachers can build "mental models" of students to decide when to intervene based on expected utility, improving student performance at lower communication costs.3. Teachers can further personalize explanations using "theory of mind", tailoring explanations to help the particular student model. This leads to better teaching compared to unpersonalized explanations.4. In multi-turn interactions, teacher explanations generalize and improve student performance on future unexplained data points. 5. Misaligned teachers can intentionally provide misleading explanations to reduce student performance.Overall, the work provides a comprehensive analysis of whether, when and how language model teachers can successfully teach using natural language explanations, highlighting both the potential benefits and risks. The theory of mind approach allows modeling the mental states of students to personalize teaching.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper investigates whether large language models can act as effective teachers for weaker agents by intervening with natural language explanations, and finds that they can successfully build mental models of students to decide when and how to personalize explanations in order to improve student performance both on explained examples and on future unexplained data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can act as effective teachers for weaker AI agents, using natural language explanations to improve their reasoning skills. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:- Most prior work has focused on evaluating explanations by having students simulate or predict the teacher's behavior. This paper directly tests if explanations improve student performance on reasoning tasks.- Recent work has proposed knowledge distillation methods where a smaller model is finetuned on the explanations from a larger model. This paper explores more interactive student-teacher communication with considerations of when and how to explain. - Theory of mind has been used in some prior AI systems, but this paper utilizes it to build mental models of the student that help decide when and how to explain. The prompts provide a simple but effective implementation.- Unlike most past work that looks at one-shot explanation evaluation, this paper also studies multi-turn interactions where explanations aim to improve student performance on new unexplained data.- Testing misaligned teachers reveals both positive and negative implications of influential teacher explanations. Most prior work assumes an accurate teacher.Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of student-teacher communication with LLMs, using theory of mind to decide when and how to intervene. The interactive setting and focus on improving the student are distinctive from related work that evaluates explanations in isolation or via simulated predictions. The results demonstrate promise for LLM communication, but also reveal concerns like their potential to mislead students.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Explore using human explanations that are tailored to improve a particular student model, rather than generic explanations, to see if it leads to further improvements in teaching ability. - Consider non-uniform communication costs for teacher explanations (e.g. based on length or complexity), instead of the uniform cost assumption made in this work.- Evaluate the ability of teachers to teach students in more interactive settings with multiple rounds of explanation and prediction. The authors present some initial results but suggest more work is needed.- Explore other prompt designs and methods to improve the teacher's ability to build effective mental models and tailor explanations for the student.- Extend the frameworks and ideas to other domains beyond the textual reasoning tasks explored in this work.- Further analyze the implications of teachers being able to intentionally provide misleading explanations and ways to safeguard against it.- Evaluate how well the approaches could work for human-AI teaching in addition to the model-model teaching explored in this paper.In summary, the key suggestions are around exploring more advanced prompt designs and interaction frameworks, testing on more tasks, and further analysis of potential negative implications of influential but incorrect model explanations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores the ability of large language models (LLMs) to teach weaker agents through natural language explanations. It proposes a student-teacher framework between two LLM agents to investigate if, when, and how the teacher should intervene with explanations to improve the student's performance. The authors decompose the teaching problem into several research questions. First, they show LLMs can intervene at test time to improve a student LLM's predictions, with more intervention leading to better performance. Next, they propose the teacher build a mental model of the student to decide when to best intervene based on expected utility. The teacher can further personalize explanations using theory of mind. Teacher explanations are also shown to generalize and improve student performance on unexplained data in multi-turn interactions. Finally, the authors demonstrate misaligned teachers can intentionally provide misleading explanations to lower student performance. Overall, the work highlights LLMs' capabilities and limitations for teaching weaker agents.
