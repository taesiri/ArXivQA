# [Multimodal Fusion with Pre-Trained Model Features in Affective Behaviour   Analysis In-the-wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15044)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses two problems - Expression Recognition and Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation from video data. 
- This involves recognizing emotions from complex "in-the-wild" multimodal video data containing multiple people, noise, and other challenges.

Proposed Solution: 
- They propose using pre-trained models to extract features from the audio, visual, text modalities. 
- They perform modal alignment, multimodal fusion using MCTN, MFN and attention models to effectively integrate multimodal information.
- For VA estimation, they use CCC loss and techniques like pseudo-labeling and label smoothing. 
- For expression recognition, they use a ResNet Transformer Encoder architecture with MobileNetV3 backbone and F1 loss.

Main Contributions:
- Combination of multimodal fusion and pre-trained models for affective computing in the wild.
- Assessment of different pre-trained models for feature extraction from audio, visual, text data.
- Use of different modal alignment and fusion techniques like MCTN, MFN and attention models. 
- Demonstrated effectiveness of CCC loss for VA estimation.
- Proposed ResNet Transformer Encoder architecture with MobileNetV3 backbone for expression recognition.
- Impact: Significantly outperformed baselines in the ABAW competition for both expression recognition and VA estimation.

In summary, they effectively leverage sophisticated pre-trained models and advanced fusion techniques for multimodal emotion recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance on an in-the-wild benchmark.
