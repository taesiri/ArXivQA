# [Convergence of Gradient Descent for Recurrent Neural Networks: A   Nonasymptotic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12241)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used for learning dynamical systems, but theoretical understanding of training RNNs with gradient descent is limited. Prior works require massive overparameterization for convergence guarantees.

- Key questions: Can RNNs achieve optimality without overparameterization? What is the impact of long-term dependencies (memory) on required network size? What class of dynamical systems can RNNs represent? 

Proposed Solution:
- Perform non-asymptotic analysis of gradient descent for standard Elman-type RNNs to prove sharp bounds on network size and training iterations.

- Explicitly characterize the class of dynamical systems that can be approximated by infinite-width limit of RNNs using kernel methods. 

- Establish local smoothness properties of the hidden state dynamics to enable tight analysis addressing complications due to weight sharing in RNNs.

Key Contributions:
- Prove RNNs with only O(log n) neurons can achieve optimality, with n being number of samples. Massively improves on prior polynomial bounds. 

- Formalize exploding/vanishing gradient phenomena: network size and iterations scale exponentially for systems with long-term dependencies, polynomially otherwise.

- Provide first explicit characterization of dynamical systems representable by RNNs in infinite-width limit using transportation mappings.

- Derive superior guarantees for projected gradient descent, highlighting impact of regularization on stability and sample efficiency.

In summary, the paper provides a significantly tightened analysis of gradient descent for RNNs highlighting the role of memory and establishing learnability without overparameterization. The results bridge theory and practice for this important class of models.
