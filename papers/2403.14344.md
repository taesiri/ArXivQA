# [Tell Me What You Want (What You Really, Really Want): Addressing the   Expectation Gap for Goal Conveyance from Humans to Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conveying goals between humans and autonomous systems is challenging due to mismatches in expertise and expectations. 
- Humans make many implicit assumptions when conveying goals to each other that need to be made explicit for robots.
- There are gaps in existing analysis techniques to systematically capture the relevant implicit human expectations and constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a "robot task analysis" (RTA) framework that builds on applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA) methods used in human training.
- RTA adds considerations for physical, sensory, and other robot-specific components missing from ACTA.  
- Introduce a "robot expectations matrix" that lists human expectations (from psychology research) against robot system components to methodically consider their interactions. Allows proactively identifying conflicts early.
- Use the RTA framework and expectations matrix during development to reduce design iterations. Also use it to identify violations that should be communicated to users to avoid rejection.

Main Contributions:
- Identified common categories of unstated human expectations that cause human-robot goal conveyance issues.
- Proposed augmentations to existing task analysis methods to better capture robot task requirements. 
- Developed the robot expectations matrix to systematically consider interaction of human expectations and robot capabilities during design.
- Provided recommendations to use these methods to improve development efficiency and user acceptance.
- Highlighted areas for future work like representation alignment, learning constraints from demonstration, and context-aware goal learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from this paper: This paper proposes a robot task analysis process using cognitive task analysis and an expectations matrix to more effectively translate human goals into autonomous system requirements and design by bridging the gaps in expertise, system capabilities, and implied human expectations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of a framework called "robot task analysis" (RTA) that augments applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA) methods to help elicit implicit human knowledge and expectations that are needed to translate tasks to autonomous systems. 

2) The concept of an "expectations matrix" that can be used during system design to systematically consider the interactions between human expectations and different elements of robot system design like sensors, controllers, task planners etc. This is proposed as a way to proactively identify potential issues early.

3) Identification of some underlying causes of difficulties in conveying goals between humans and autonomous systems, including mismatches in expertise and unstated human expectations. 

4) Recommendations for future research directions focused on human-robot representation alignment, learning implicit constraints from demonstrations, and context-aware task learning.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and proposal of the RTA framework and expectations matrix to help improve the goal conveyance process in the design and operation of autonomous systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, the main keywords associated with this paper are:

- Robot design
- Human expectations
- Task analysis  
- User acceptance

As stated in the abstract and keywords section of the paper:

"We show how such expectations can be used in conjunction with task-specific expectations and the system design process for AS to improve design team communication, alleviate barriers to user rejection, and reduce the number of design cycles."

"Keywords: Robot design, human expectations, task analysis, user acceptance."

So the key terms focus on improving the robot design process by better understanding and aligning human expectations, using task analysis methods, with the goal of improving user acceptance of autonomous systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose a new method called "robot task analysis" (RTA) that augments applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA) for developing autonomous systems. What are the key limitations of ACTA that RTA aims to address? How does RTA build upon and extend ACTA?

2. One key component proposed in RTA is the "expectations matrix." What are the two axes of this matrix and what does each axis represent? How does explicitly mapping the interactions between these two axes help in the system design process?

3. The authors highlight the concept of "unstated expectations" that humans hold about how other humans will behave. Why can these unstated expectations lead to issues when interacting with autonomous systems? Provide some examples of common unstated expectations referenced in the paper.  

4. The authors recommend using principles from infant psychology research to help uncover common human expectations. What are some examples of research methods from infant psychology that could shed light on implicit human expectations? Why are these particularly useful?

5. The paper discusses differences in how procedural knowledge is encoded explicitly vs implicitly as humans gain more expertise. How might this impact cognitive task analysis methods with expert users? What supplement to ACTA do the authors suggest to help elicit implicit user knowledge?

6. Domain experts hold specialized expectations that may not generalize to lay users. What two recommendation techniques does the paper suggest to uncover these specialized expectations? Explain why both techniques are necessary.  

7. The expectations matrix is proposed to highlight areas where system design violates user expectations. What are two possible ways the authors suggest addressing expectation violations surfaced through the matrix? When might one approach be preferred over the other?

8. What validations need to be done regarding the proposed RTA method? What are some practical barriers to validating RTA for real-world autonomous system development?  

9. The paper recommends research directions like learning from demonstration and context-aware task learning. Explain how advances in these areas could facilitate human goal conveyance for autonomous systems.  

10. How might the methodology change if the autonomous system in question involves multiple robots coordinating, rather than a single robot? What additional considerations might come into play?
