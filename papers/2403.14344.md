# [Tell Me What You Want (What You Really, Really Want): Addressing the   Expectation Gap for Goal Conveyance from Humans to Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conveying goals between humans and autonomous systems is challenging due to mismatches in expertise and expectations. 
- Humans make many implicit assumptions when conveying goals to each other that need to be made explicit for robots.
- There are gaps in existing analysis techniques to systematically capture the relevant implicit human expectations and constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a "robot task analysis" (RTA) framework that builds on applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA) methods used in human training.
- RTA adds considerations for physical, sensory, and other robot-specific components missing from ACTA.  
- Introduce a "robot expectations matrix" that lists human expectations (from psychology research) against robot system components to methodically consider their interactions. Allows proactively identifying conflicts early.
- Use the RTA framework and expectations matrix during development to reduce design iterations. Also use it to identify violations that should be communicated to users to avoid rejection.

Main Contributions:
- Identified common categories of unstated human expectations that cause human-robot goal conveyance issues.
- Proposed augmentations to existing task analysis methods to better capture robot task requirements. 
- Developed the robot expectations matrix to systematically consider interaction of human expectations and robot capabilities during design.
- Provided recommendations to use these methods to improve development efficiency and user acceptance.
- Highlighted areas for future work like representation alignment, learning constraints from demonstration, and context-aware goal learning.
