# [TESS: Text-to-Text Self-Conditioned Simplex Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08379)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can diffusion models be effectively adapted for natural language generation tasks, overcoming challenges related to the discrete nature of text?The key hypotheses tested in this work are:1) Diffusing directly on the vocabulary logit space rather than typical learned embedding spaces is more suitable for language.2) Fully non-autoregressive decoding allows generating complete sequences in parallel and flexibly handling variable sequence lengths. 3) A new form of self-conditioning that leverages the logit simplex structure improves generation quality.The authors propose TESS, a text-to-text diffusion model that performs diffusion directly on the vocabulary logit simplex, decodes fully non-autoregressively, and uses an efficient self-conditioning method. Through experiments on text generation and understanding tasks, they demonstrate TESS's effectiveness compared to prior diffusion and non-autoregressive methods. The central goal is adapting the diffusion paradigm to language in a way that maintains its benefits like parallel decoding while overcoming challenges related to text's discrete nature.
