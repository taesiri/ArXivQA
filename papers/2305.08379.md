# [TESS: Text-to-Text Self-Conditioned Simplex Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08379)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can diffusion models be effectively adapted for natural language generation tasks, overcoming challenges related to the discrete nature of text?

The key hypotheses tested in this work are:

1) Diffusing directly on the vocabulary logit space rather than typical learned embedding spaces is more suitable for language.

2) Fully non-autoregressive decoding allows generating complete sequences in parallel and flexibly handling variable sequence lengths. 

3) A new form of self-conditioning that leverages the logit simplex structure improves generation quality.

The authors propose TESS, a text-to-text diffusion model that performs diffusion directly on the vocabulary logit simplex, decodes fully non-autoregressively, and uses an efficient self-conditioning method. Through experiments on text generation and understanding tasks, they demonstrate TESS's effectiveness compared to prior diffusion and non-autoregressive methods. The central goal is adapting the diffusion paradigm to language in a way that maintains its benefits like parallel decoding while overcoming challenges related to text's discrete nature.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing TESS, a new text-to-text diffusion model for natural language generation tasks. The key aspects of TESS are:

- It is fully non-autoregressive, allowing parallel generation of entire sequences rather than block-by-block or token-by-token.

- It performs diffusion directly on the vocabulary logit space rather than typical latent embeddings. This avoids the need for mapping between discrete and continuous representations.

- It incorporates a novel form of self-conditioning that exploits the semantics of the logit simplex for more effective conditioning. 

- It is evaluated on a diverse set of language generation tasks including summarization, simplification, paraphrasing, and question generation. Results show it outperforms prior non-autoregressive and diffusion models and achieves competitive performance with strong pretrained autoregressive models.

- It can generate variable length outputs, overcoming a limitation of many non-autoregressive models.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a fully non-autoregressive text diffusion model operating on the logit space with an efficient self-conditioning scheme, and demonstrating its effectiveness on a variety of text generation tasks compared to previous state-of-the-art models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes TESS, a non-autoregressive text diffusion model that performs diffusion directly on the vocabulary logit space, incorporates efficient self-conditioning to improve sample quality, and demonstrates strong performance on a variety of natural language generation and understanding tasks compared to previous diffusion and non-autoregressive methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in text diffusion modeling:

- It proposes a fully non-autoregressive text diffusion model called TESS, unlike prior work like SSD-LM that uses a semi-autoregressive approach. Being fully non-autoregressive allows TESS to generate longer sequences more efficiently.

- TESS performs diffusion directly on the vocabulary logit space rather than on latent embeddings like most prior work. This avoids issues around training instability and the need for auxiliary mapping between discrete and continuous representations. 

- The paper demonstrates strong performance of TESS on a broad set of language generation tasks including summarization, simplification, paraphrase generation, and question generation. Results meet or exceed recent diffusion models and compete with strong autoregressive baselines.

- TESS incorporates a novel self-conditioning approach during diffusion that is tailored to the logit space. Experiments show this is more effective than prior self-conditioning strategies that simply concatenate context vectors.

- The paper provides extensive analysis and ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of design decisions like self-conditioning, number of sampling steps, and inference speed.

Overall, this paper pushes text diffusion modeling forward through innovations like non-autoregressive generation and simplex-based self-conditioning. The strong empirical results across diverse language tasks highlight the viability of the TESS model versus prior diffusion techniques. The analyses also surface key factors and tradeoffs to optimize when applying these types of generative models to language.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Pretraining the proposed TESS model from scratch using diffusion objectives like denoising and infilling. The authors note that they initialized their model from a RoBERTa checkpoint, but suspect that diffusion pretraining could provide further performance improvements.

- Investigating the potential benefits of TESS for long sequence modeling. The authors suggest that the full potential of diffusion models may lie in generating very long texts, so scaling up the models and sequence lengths is an area for future work. 

- Accelerating sampling speed in TESS through techniques specialized for the logit simplex space. The discrete simplex semantics could enable faster sampling schemes compared to typical continuous embedding spaces.

- Studying the theoretical properties of sampling from the logit simplex space to better understand why TESS requires fewer steps than prior diffusion models. The deterministic vs stochastic sampling tradeoff merits further analysis.

- Extending TESS to open-ended dialogue tasks and other natural language tasks beyond the supervised setup studied in the paper. The text-to-text formulation makes TESS amenable to other NLG applications.

- Scaling up model size, datasets, and computational resources to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with diffusion models on language tasks.

In summary, the main future directions focus on diffusion pretraining, long text generation, faster sampling, theoretical analysis, model scaling, and expanding the range of tasks. The authors position TESS as a promising new paradigm for non-autoregressive text generation using diffusion models.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are trying to address is how to effectively apply diffusion models to natural language generation tasks. Some of the key challenges they identify include:

- Natural language is inherently discrete, while most diffusion models work well for continuous data like images. This makes directly applying diffusion models to text difficult. 

- Many prior diffusion models for text operate in the latent embedding space, but translating between the continuous embeddings and discrete tokens can be problematic.

- Existing text diffusion models are often limited to short contexts or are semi-autoregressive, restricting their flexibility for long or non-monotonic generation.

- Diffusion models for text have lagged behind autoregressive models like GPT-2/3 and BART on natural language tasks.

To address these issues, the authors propose TESS, a text-to-text self-conditioned simplex diffusion model. The key ideas in TESS are:

- Operate directly on the vocabulary probability simplex rather than latent embeddings. This avoids issues translating between continuous and discrete spaces.

- Use a non-autoregressive transformer encoder architecture. This allows parallel generation of even long sequences. 

- Introduce a form of self-conditioning tailored to the simplex space. This improves sample quality.

- Demonstrate strong performance on a suite of language generation and understanding tasks, closing the gap to autoregressive models.

So in summary, the main problem is adapting diffusion models to effectively handle discrete textual data and generation tasks, overcoming issues that have limited prior diffusion models for language. TESS introduces innovations like simplex diffusion and self-conditioning to push diffusion models for text forward.
