# [LoDisc: Learning Global-Local Discriminative Features for   Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04066)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current self-supervised contrastive learning methods tend to learn coarse global image features that are useful for generic object recognition. 
- However, such global features overlook subtle local details that are important for fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) tasks distinguishing between sub-categories.

Proposed Solution:  
- A global-local self-supervised contrastive learning framework to learn both global and local discriminative features.
- A new "Local Discrimination" (LoDisc) pretext task to explicitly supervise focus on local pivotal regions using a location-wise mask sampling strategy.
- Local pivotal regions are identified using attention weights from a vision transformer. Masking keeps high-attention regions while removing other patches.
- A local discriminative branch learns features on the pivotal regions guided by LoDisc, along with global branches.

Main Contributions:
- Novel global-local framework to learn both global coarse and local fine-grained discriminative features in a self-supervised manner.
- LoDisc pretext task to discover pivotal local regions without annotations and learn subtle local features.
- Location-wise attention-based mask sampling to selectively retain pivotal regions as model input.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on multiple fine-grained datasets for classification and retrieval.
- Also shows good improvements on generic Caltech dataset, highlighting wide applicability.

In summary, the paper proposes a self-supervised method to overcome global coarse-level feature learning limitations for fine-grained tasks by additionally learning local discriminative representations guided by attention-based masking of images.
