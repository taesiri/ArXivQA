# [MineDreamer: Learning to Follow Instructions via Chain-of-Imagination   for Simulated-World Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12037)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing approaches for building embodied agents that can follow diverse instructions struggle to do so steadily, failing to understand abstract, sequential natural language instructions. Agents cannot translate instructions into precise prompts tailored to the current state to demonstrate desired behavior. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MineDreamer, an embodied agent in Minecraft, with an innovative Chain-of-Imagination (CoI) mechanism to enhance instruction following ability. The agent envisions sub-steps to achieve goals based on instructions and states. These imagined steps serve as precise visual prompts to guide action generation towards achieving them.

The system has three key components:
1) An Imaginator (diffusion model enhanced by a multimodal language model) to imagine goal images containing physical rules and environment understanding.
2) A Prompt Generator to convert imaginations into latent visual prompts offering precise behavior demonstrations. 
3) A PolicyNet (foundation model) to use prompts to predict actions.

Through multi-turn CoI interactions between Imaginator and PolicyNet, prompts are generated that align with states to steadily follow instructions.

Contributions:
1) Introduces CoI method that breaks down instructions via “self multi-turn interaction” for steady following.  
2) Proposes a Goal Drift Collection method and an enhanced Imaginator to generate state-aware goal imaginations.
3) Creates MineDreamer agent with CoI mechanism that doubles performance of baselines in executing single and multi-step instructions.
4) Showcases potential as downstream controller under a high-level planner.

The proposed paradigm of generating tailored visual prompts can help models steadily follow instructions in simulated world control.
