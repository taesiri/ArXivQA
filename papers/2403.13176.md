# [Castor: Competing shapelets for fast and accurate time series   classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13176)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Time series classification involves constructing a model to accurately assign labels to unlabeled time series data based on a collection of labeled time series samples. While methods like shapelets, dictionaries, and convolutions have pushed accuracy, there is still room for improvement in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes CASTor, a novel time series transformation method based on dilated shapelets that compete to represent different temporal contexts. CASTor transforms a time series into a feature representation by sliding dilated shapelets across a padded time series to compute distance profiles. Shapelets are organized into groups and compete at each timestep to best match that context based on having the minimum distance. For each shapelet, aggregated min distance, max distance, and occurrence frequency features are extracted. This allows CASTor to transition between distance-based and dictionary-based approaches through balancing competition and independence.

Main Contributions:
- Effectiveness: CASTor achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for shapelet classifiers on 112 UCR datasets, significantly outperforming methods like Rocket, Hydra, and DST. It has accuracy close to MultiRocket but is more efficient.
- Efficiency: CASTor demonstrates superior computational efficiency to Rocket and MultiRocket while having accuracy close to MultiRocket. It trains/tests 112 UCR datasets 20% faster than Rocket and 30% faster than MultiRocket.
- Completeness: Comprehensive ablation studies are performed to analyze algorithmic choices and suggest accurate default hyperparameters that yield performance superior to most state-of-the-art classifiers.
- Reproducibility: Efficient reference implementation of CASTor and state-of-the-art methods is provided to ensure reproducibility.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions around a new time series transform called CASTor that pushes accuracy and efficiency for shapelet classifiers by having shapelets compete to represent contexts. Thorough experimentation demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.
