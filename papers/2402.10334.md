# [HI-GAN: Hierarchical Inpainting GAN with Auxiliary Inputs for Combined   RGB and Depth Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Inpainting involves filling in missing pixels in images, which is important for augmented reality (AR) and diminished reality (DR) applications. 
- Existing RGBD inpainting methods focus on RGB or depth separately, rely on multiple models and complex training, or use predicted depth lacking accuracy.  
- Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth sensors used in AR devices produce imperfect depth maps with missing pixels.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Hierarchical Inpainting GAN (HI-GAN), an end-to-end framework with three collaborating GANs for RGBD inpainting.
- It takes masked RGB, depth, edge and segmentation label images as input. EdgeGAN and LabelGAN inpaint edge and labels respectively. 
- CombinedRGBD-GAN combines latent representations from EdgeGAN and LabelGAN to guide RGBD inpainting.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to incorporate segmentation labels to augment RGBD inpainting. Edge and labels provide complementary context.
- Hierarchical optimization where EdgeGAN and LabelGAN are trained separately and further optimized inside CombinedRGBD-GAN.
- End-to-end training of all three GANs simultaneously, without needing attention mechanisms or complex training strategies.
- Experiments show HI-GAN achieves highest SSIM, PSNR and lowest MAE, RMSE compared to state-of-the-art baseline models, proving superiority in RGBD inpainting.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative RGBD inpainting framework comprising hierarchical GANs optimized collaboratively in an end-to-end manner. Auxiliary edge and label inputs guide accurate inpainting through context and optimization. Experiments validate the approach's effectiveness.
