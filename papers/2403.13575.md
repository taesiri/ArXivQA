# [Leveraging feature communication in federated learning for remote   sensing image classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13575)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Remote sensing applications need to process large distributed datasets, requiring efficient and privacy-preserving methodologies. 
- Centralized training leads to privacy issues while localized training struggles with non-uniform data distribution and insufficient data.
- There is a need for communication-efficient federated learning (FL) methods suitable for remote sensing.

Proposed Solution:
- Explore innovative FL communication strategies for remote sensing image classification based on FedAVG:
  - Feature-centric communication: clients exchange only average feature vectors instead of full models. Uses Large Margin Cosine Loss (LMCL) to enable learning from features.
  - Pseudo-weight amalgamation: constrains feature deviation across clients via regularization.
  - Combined method: utilizes both feature communication and FedAVG weight synchronization for superior performance.
  - Retrieval-based classification: formulates prediction as nearest-neighbor search in the feature space.

Contributions:  
- Proposes and evaluates various innovative FL strategies for remote sensing applications.
- Shows feature-centric communication enables faster convergence and greater privacy while reducing communication costs. 
- Combined approach achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging both synchronized weights and features.
- Provides insights into implications of feature-based communication for remote sensing scenarios.

In summary, the paper explores feature-centric FL strategies that accelerate convergence, heighten privacy and reduce communication costs for remote sensing image classification. A combined synchronization approach achieves high performance by amalgamating weights and features.
