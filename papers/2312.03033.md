# [LiDAR-based Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing person re-identification (ReID) methods rely on cameras and appearance features like clothing color, which have limitations in poor lighting conditions and complex backgrounds. Cameras also lack 3D shape information and raise privacy concerns. Although some works have explored depth sensors, they are limited to indoor scenes. This paper explores using LiDAR for the first time for person ReID to address these issues.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose ReID3D, an end-to-end LiDAR-based person ReID framework. The key components are:

1) A Graph-based Complementary Enhancement Encoder (GCEE) to extract comprehensive 3D shape and motion features from LiDAR point clouds. It consists of a graph convolutional network backbone and a complementary feature extractor.

2) A transformer-based temporal fusion module to aggregate motion features over time.

3) A multi-task pre-training strategy on a simulated LiDAR dataset with point cloud completion and body shape estimation to learn robust 3D human representations.

The pre-trained GCEE is finetuned on real LiDAR data for the ReID task.

Contributions:

1) First work on LiDAR-based person ReID, showing LiDAR's potential for ReID in complex outdoor scenes.

2) LReID - first real-world LiDAR ReID dataset with 320 identities in varying conditions. 

3) LReID-sync - new simulated LiDAR dataset with 600 pedestrians for pre-training.

4) Proposed ReID3D framework outperforms state-of-the-art camera ReID methods, especially in low light conditions. The multi-task pre-training brings significant gains.

In summary, this paper pioneers LiDAR-based person ReID to effectively exploit 3D shape features while addressing limitations of camera-based ReID. The ReID3D framework and new datasets advance capabilities in this direction.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. This is the first work on LiDAR-based person re-identification (ReID), demonstrating the practicality of using LiDAR for person ReID in challenging real-world outdoor scenes.

2. The paper builds LReID, the first LiDAR-based person ReID dataset, collected in several outdoor scenes with variations in natural conditions. It also introduces LReID-sync, a new simulated pedestrian dataset for pre-training ReID models.

3. The paper proposes a LiDAR-based ReID framework called ReID3D, which utilizes pre-training to guide an encoder to learn 3D body features. It also introduces a Graph-based Complementary Enhancement Encoder (GCEE) to extract comprehensive and discriminative features from point clouds.
