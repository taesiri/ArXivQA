# [Analysis of Embeddings Learned by End-to-End Machine Learning Eye   Movement-driven Biometrics Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Prior research has shown that biometric features with high temporal persistence (stability over time) confer better performance to biometric systems. 
- With the shift towards machine learning in biometrics, it is unclear if embeddings learned by these models exhibit similar temporal persistence as traditional biometric features. 
- This study aims to analyze the temporal persistence, reliability, and efficacy of embeddings learned by a state-of-the-art machine learning model for eye movement biometrics.

Proposed Solution 
- Utilize the Eye Know You Too (EKYT) model, a densenet-based neural network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on eye movement biometrics.
- Conduct experiments by varying input data conditions - changing sequence lengths, sampling rates, training data percentages, and signal quality.
- Evaluate the embeddings using 3 metrics: 
    1) Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) for temporal persistence
    2) Pearson R intercorrelations 
    3) Equal error rate (EER) for biometric performance
- Analyze how these metrics change under different data conditions to assess embedding reliability.

Key Contributions
- Validated that machine learning derived embeddings mirror the temporal persistence seen in traditional biometrics features. Longer sequences produce more reliable embeddings.
- Showed sampling rate significantly impacts embeddings - moderate reduction is tolerable but excessive decimation causes disproportionate decline in quality.   
- Reducing training data percentages worsens embedding consistency and biometric accuracy.
- Signal quality has modest influence on embeddings - minimal change in KCC but increased EER with lower precision and accuracy.
- Intercorrelations among embeddings exhibit remarkable stability irrespective of input variations.

In summary, the study provided new insights into the temporal persistence of machine learning embeddings for biometrics while also highlighting their sensitivity to changes in input data characteristics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the temporal persistence, reliability, and biometric efficacy of embeddings learned by an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for eye movement biometrics under varying input data conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It aims to validate whether the embeddings learned from a machine learning model in an eye movement biometrics pipeline exhibit temporal persistence similar to that seen with traditional biometric features. 

2. It examines the influence of varying input data (such as sampling rate, data length, and quality) on the temporal stability, reliability, and biometric efficacy of the learned embeddings.

3. It seeks to understand how input data variations affect the overall performance of the eye movement biometrics system, providing insights into the adaptability and consistency of machine learning models when exposed to diverse real-world data conditions.

In summary, the key contribution is an in-depth analysis focused on the machine learning-derived embeddings in an eye movement biometrics context, evaluating their temporal persistence properties and the impact of input data variability on the reliability and efficacy of the biometric system.

The paper focuses on analyzing the embeddings learned by a machine learning-based eye movement biometric authentication system called Eye Know You Too (EKYT). It examines the temporal persistence and reliability of these learned embeddings under varying conditions of data length, sampling rate, and signal quality. Key metrics used include Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance (KCC), intercorrelations, and equal error rate (EER). The goal is to gain insights into how input data variability impacts the efficacy and consistency of an eye movement biometric system that utilizes deep learning techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance (KCC) over Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) to measure temporal persistence of embeddings. What is the rationale behind choosing KCC over ICC for this analysis? 

2. The Equal Error Rate (EER) is used as one of the evaluation metrics in this study. Explain why EER was chosen over other authentication performance metrics like Accuracy, F1-Score or AUC-ROC.

3. The paper analyzes the effect of varying sequence sizes on the reliability of embeddings. Beyond the sequence lengths explored in the paper, what further analysis could be done to establish boundaries on optimal sequence sizes?  

4. How exactly does the weighted sum of categorical cross-entropy and multi-similarity loss used during training impact the clustering of embeddings from the same class together?

5. The pre-processing steps involve replacing NaN values with 0 before feeding to the neural network. What are the potential drawbacks of this approach? Are there better ways to handle missing values?

6. The results show intercorrelations among embeddings remain mostly unaffected by input data variations. What implications does this have on the information captured within the embeddings?

7. The analysis relies on EER for biometric performance measurement. But could the consistency of embeddings itself be used as a measure of biometric reliability? If yes, how can this be quantified?

8. How can the notion of temporal persistence of embeddings be leveraged to make the model more resistant to presentation attacks or spoofing attempts? 

9. The impact of eye tracker sampling rate on embeddings has been analyzed. But are there any other eye tracker specifications that could influence embedding efficacy?

10. The study establishes boundaries on how much input data can be compromised before authentication performance drops significantly. Can similar optimality thresholds be identified along other data dimensions like sampling rate or eye tracking precision?
