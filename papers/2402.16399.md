# [Analysis of Embeddings Learned by End-to-End Machine Learning Eye   Movement-driven Biometrics Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Prior research has shown that biometric features with high temporal persistence (stability over time) confer better performance to biometric systems. 
- With the shift towards machine learning in biometrics, it is unclear if embeddings learned by these models exhibit similar temporal persistence as traditional biometric features. 
- This study aims to analyze the temporal persistence, reliability, and efficacy of embeddings learned by a state-of-the-art machine learning model for eye movement biometrics.

Proposed Solution 
- Utilize the Eye Know You Too (EKYT) model, a densenet-based neural network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on eye movement biometrics.
- Conduct experiments by varying input data conditions - changing sequence lengths, sampling rates, training data percentages, and signal quality.
- Evaluate the embeddings using 3 metrics: 
    1) Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) for temporal persistence
    2) Pearson R intercorrelations 
    3) Equal error rate (EER) for biometric performance
- Analyze how these metrics change under different data conditions to assess embedding reliability.

Key Contributions
- Validated that machine learning derived embeddings mirror the temporal persistence seen in traditional biometrics features. Longer sequences produce more reliable embeddings.
- Showed sampling rate significantly impacts embeddings - moderate reduction is tolerable but excessive decimation causes disproportionate decline in quality.   
- Reducing training data percentages worsens embedding consistency and biometric accuracy.
- Signal quality has modest influence on embeddings - minimal change in KCC but increased EER with lower precision and accuracy.
- Intercorrelations among embeddings exhibit remarkable stability irrespective of input variations.

In summary, the study provided new insights into the temporal persistence of machine learning embeddings for biometrics while also highlighting their sensitivity to changes in input data characteristics.
