# [Institutional Platform for Secure Self-Service Large Language Model   Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are very costly to train, store, and host for individual use. Enabling personalized LLM use cases in a cost-effective and secure way is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
- A self-service system is proposed that allows users to easily upload datasets, configure/launch training jobs, and interact with resulting personalized LLMs. 
- The system utilizes adapter-based training (LoRA) to only update a small percentage of LLM parameters per job. 
- Multi-adapter inference is supported on shared base models to concurrently host thousands of lightweight adapters.
- A secure computational overlay network (Cresco agents) connects isolated resources, provides end-to-end encryption, and allows dynamic load balancing.

Key Contributions:
- Self-service interface for personal LLM training/hosting
- Leverages LoRA training for efficiency 
- Enables concurrent and cost-effective multi-adapter inference
- Establishes secure computational network between resources 
- Supports dynamic discovery/utilization of heterogeneous resources
- Allows scaling to support large user base with personalized LLMs

In summary, the paper proposes an end-to-end system to enable personalized LLM use cases at scale. Efficiency, security and easy access are key focuses. The multi-adapter inference and overlay network are the main technical innovations described.
