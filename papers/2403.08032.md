## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for various applications like self-driving cars, robot navigation, etc. However, existing methods have limitations in fully leveraging the underlying motion patterns in pedestrian trajectories to make accurate predictions. 

Method - LG-Traj:
This paper proposes a novel LLM Guided Trajectory prediction (LG-Traj) approach that effectively incorporates motion cues from a large language model (LLM), along with past trajectories, to predict future trajectories. The key aspects are:

1. Utilize LLM to generate descriptive 'motion cues' from past pedestrian trajectories that capture inherent motion patterns (like linear, curved motions).

2. Incorporate 'future motion cues' by clustering diverse future trajectory behaviors from training data into mixture of Gaussians. 

3. Augment past trajectories using rank-k approximation with SVD to retain critical information.

4. A Motion Encoder captures spatio-temporal patterns using past motion cues, observed trajectories and future motion cues. 

5. A Social Decoder then combines the pedestrianâ€™s motion embedding with neighbouring pedestrians' interactions for trajectory forecasting.

Main Contributions:

1. Novel incorporation of descriptive motion cues from LLM to better capture trajectory motion patterns.

2. Effective usage of future motion cues from trajectory clusters to model uncertainty.

3. Trajectory augmentation using rank-k approximation to improve representation learning.  

4. State-of-the-art performance on ETH-UCY and SDD benchmarks, with 10% and 4% relative improvement in average trajectory error over best baseline.

5. Ablation studies validate the importance of individual components like motion cues, encoding, and augmentation.

In summary, this paper explores an effective way to integrate LLM generated motion cues into pedestrian trajectory forecasting to achieve improved modeling of motion patterns and performance. The incorporation of future motion cues and trajectory augmentation further helps in handling diversity and improving representations.
