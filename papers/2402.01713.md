# [Prompting Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Clinical Prediction with   Structured Longitudinal Electronic Health Record Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01713)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional machine learning models struggle to make accurate predictions on new/emerging diseases due to lack of historical training data. 
- Structured longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data is complex and differs from the unstructured text data that large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are designed to handle.  

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a prompting framework to enable LLMs to effectively comprehend and analyze structured EHR data for clinical prediction tasks in a zero-shot setting.

Key Contributions:
- Propose a prompting strategy that represents the longitudinal, sparse, knowledge-infused nature of EHR data for LLMs. This includes units, reference ranges and an in-context learning approach with example patient data.
- Demonstrate LLMs can successfully perform diverse clinical prediction tasks like mortality, length of stay and readmission prediction over varying time contexts. 
- Benchmark experiments on real-world ICU datasets show GPT-4 with the tailored prompting framework can outperform machine learning models in low data settings. GPT-4 achieved 35% higher AUROC for mortality prediction.
- The work underscores the potential of LLMs to enhance clinical decision-making, especially for emerging diseases where historical data is scarce. It also opens possibilities for better understanding such healthcare challenges.

In summary, the key innovation is an elicitation strategy using prompts to extract predictive insights from LLMs for EHR data. By encoding the data characteristics and clinical knowledge into the prompts, significant performance gains are achieved in scarce data settings relevant for emerging health threats.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates how to effectively adapt large language models like GPT-4 for zero-shot prediction on clinical tasks using longitudinal electronic health records, through elaborately designed prompts that represent the structure, sparsity, and domain knowledge aspects of the data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an elaborately designed prompting framework that enables large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to effectively perform zero-shot prediction on structured longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data for diverse clinical prediction tasks. 

Specifically, the paper makes the following key contributions:

1) It identifies three key challenges when applying LLMs to EHR data: the longitudinal, sparse, and knowledge-infused nature of EHR data compared to the unstructured text LLMs are accustomed to. 

2) It systematically investigates prompt engineering techniques to address these challenges, considering:
- Effective representation of the longitudinal aspect using a feature-wise input format 
- Strategies for handling sparsity such as reserving missing values
- Incorporating domain knowledge contexts like units and reference ranges along with an in-context learning approach 

3) Through comprehensive experiments on two real-world ICU datasets, the paper demonstrates LLMs can significantly improve performance on critical healthcare predictive tasks like mortality, length-of-stay, and readmission prediction in zero-shot settings.

4) Benchmarking results show the elaborated prompting framework enables GPT-4 to outperform competitive machine learning models trained with limited data, highlighting the potential of LLMs in enhancing clinical decision-making for emerging diseases.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed prompting framework that successfully adapts LLMs to structured EHR data for zero-shot clinical prediction.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using prompt engineering to bridge the gap between structured longitudinal EHR data and unstructured text that LLMs are used to. What specific strategies were used for representing time series data and handling missing values in the prompts? How effective were these?

2. When adding clinical context to the prompts, the paper explored both adding units/reference ranges and sample input-output pairs. What was the relative impact of each of these contexts? Is there potential value in exploring other types of clinical context as well? 

3. For the sample input-output pairs used in in-context learning, how were these examples constructed? What considerations went into determining the optimal number of examples to provide? Could more sophisticated approaches to generating examples be beneficial?

4. The paper benchmarked several LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Was there any analysis done on the relationship between LLM size/architecture and effectiveness on EHR data? What insights does this provide about requirements for LLMs specialized to clinical prediction?

5. When using the Chain-of-Thought prompting approach, the performance of the LLM declined compared to the optimal approach. What are some hypotheses for why explicit step-by-step reasoning did not help for EHR prediction tasks?

6. For the time sensitivity analysis, it was found that LLMs did not exhibit significant differences in predictions across varying time spans. Why might this be the case? Are there any modifications to the prompting approach that could make LLMs more sensitive to temporal contexts?

7. The paper focused on predictions at the patient level. Could the methods be extended to population health forecasting tasks? What additional considerations would need to be made in the prompts?

8. What types of uncertainty quantification could be beneficial when using LLMs for clinical prediction? How might the prompts be designed to extract different estimates of uncertainty from the LLM's predictions?

9. The paper used simulated EHR data to construct the sample input-output pairs for in-context learning. Could there be any risks or downsides associated with training LLMs on synthetic medical data? 

10. For practical clinical use, what additional evaluations need to be done regarding the safe and responsible application of LLMs for patient care, especially in high-stakes scenarios? What protections need to be in place?
