# [Deciphering Hate: Identifying Hateful Memes and Their Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10829)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of hateful meme detection and identification of targets of hate in memes. Hateful memes that propagate hate speech are becoming prevalent on social media. Detecting and understanding such memes is challenging since they contain both visual imagery and text. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a novel multimodal framework called DORA (Dual cO-attention guided Representation Aggregator) for hateful meme detection and target identification. DORA employs a dual co-attention mechanism to extract pertinent visual and textual representations by allowing interactions between modalities. It also uses aggregators to combine the attended representations from each modality.

Key Contributions:
- Created a new dataset of hateful Bangla-English code-mixed memes labeled for detection and target identification tasks.
- Proposed a novel DORA framework that utilizes dual co-attention between visual and textual features along with aggregators to combine attended representations.
- DORA outperforms state-of-the-art visual, textual and multimodal baselines by 4-5% in F1 score on hateful meme detection and target identification tasks. 
- Ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each component of DORA.
- Analysis shows that DORA generalizes across languages while being superior in transfer learning performance.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in hateful meme analysis by releasing a dataset and developing a dual co-attention based multimodal approach that outperforms previous benchmarks. The ablation studies and cross-dataset evaluations also provide useful insights.
