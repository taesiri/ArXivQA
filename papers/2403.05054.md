# [A Sinkhorn-type Algorithm for Constrained Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05054)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper focuses on a general class of optimal transport (OT) problems with a combination of equality and inequality linear constraints. Solving such constrained OT problems allows obtaining optimal transport plans that satisfy complex geometric constraints. However, prior work on fast OT algorithms through entropic regularization, such as the Sinkhorn algorithm, focuses solely on the unconstrained case. This prompts the key question of whether one can develop a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for inequality/equality constrained OT that enjoys similar computational efficiency and scalability.

Proposed Method
The main proposal is an extension of the entropic regularization approach and the Sinkhorn algorithm to inequality/equality constrained OT problems. 

Theoretical Contributions:
- Provides an entropy regularization formulation for constrained OT and shows the approximation error reduces exponentially as the regularization parameter increases. 
- Introduces a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for constrained OT and proves its sublinear convergence in reaching approximate first-order optimality.

Algorithmic Contributions:  
- Proposes efficient row/column scaling steps interleaved with a Newton-based update of the dual variables associated with constraints. 
- Accelerates the algorithm through dynamic regularization scheduling and second-order sparse Newton iterations.

Experiments
The experiments demonstrate the proposed Sinkhorn-type algorithm can rapidly obtain low-cost transport plans that approximately satisfy constraints on synthetic random assignment problems and learning-to-rank tasks. The acceleration techniques can provide 5-100x speedups.

Impact
This work allows extending fast OT solvers to problems with complex constraints, enabling wider adoption of optimal transport with constraints in machine learning. The proposed algorithm and analysis integrate recent advances in unconstrained entropic OT to handle constraints.
