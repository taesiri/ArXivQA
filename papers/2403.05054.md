# [A Sinkhorn-type Algorithm for Constrained Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05054)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper focuses on a general class of optimal transport (OT) problems with a combination of equality and inequality linear constraints. Solving such constrained OT problems allows obtaining optimal transport plans that satisfy complex geometric constraints. However, prior work on fast OT algorithms through entropic regularization, such as the Sinkhorn algorithm, focuses solely on the unconstrained case. This prompts the key question of whether one can develop a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for inequality/equality constrained OT that enjoys similar computational efficiency and scalability.

Proposed Method
The main proposal is an extension of the entropic regularization approach and the Sinkhorn algorithm to inequality/equality constrained OT problems. 

Theoretical Contributions:
- Provides an entropy regularization formulation for constrained OT and shows the approximation error reduces exponentially as the regularization parameter increases. 
- Introduces a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for constrained OT and proves its sublinear convergence in reaching approximate first-order optimality.

Algorithmic Contributions:  
- Proposes efficient row/column scaling steps interleaved with a Newton-based update of the dual variables associated with constraints. 
- Accelerates the algorithm through dynamic regularization scheduling and second-order sparse Newton iterations.

Experiments
The experiments demonstrate the proposed Sinkhorn-type algorithm can rapidly obtain low-cost transport plans that approximately satisfy constraints on synthetic random assignment problems and learning-to-rank tasks. The acceleration techniques can provide 5-100x speedups.

Impact
This work allows extending fast OT solvers to problems with complex constraints, enabling wider adoption of optimal transport with constraints in machine learning. The proposed algorithm and analysis integrate recent advances in unconstrained entropic OT to handle constraints.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for solving optimal transport problems with a combination of equality and inequality linear constraints. Specifically:

- It introduces an entropy regularization formulation for constrained optimal transport and shows the approximation error decays exponentially as the regularization parameter increases.

- It proposes a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for the constrained case that alternates between standard Sinkhorn row/column scaling updates and a new constraint dual variable update. Convergence guarantees are provided.  

- It discusses how to extend recent acceleration techniques like entropy regularization scheduling and second-order Newton methods to the constrained setting to further improve performance.

- Overall, it provides a systematic framework and efficient algorithm for incorporating linear constraints into optimal transport problems, allowing practitioners to obtain approximate solutions to more complex constrained transport scenarios. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on problems like constrained assignment and ranking are provided.

In summary, the key novelty is developing a practical Sinkhorn-type method for optimal transport under linear equality and inequality constraints, supported by convergence guarantees, which helps expand the applicability of entropic optimal transport.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for solving constrained optimal transport problems. How does the algorithm differ from the standard Sinkhorn algorithm for unconstrained problems? What modifications were made to handle the constraints?

2) The key insight enabling the extension to constraints is viewing entropic optimal transport as an instance of entropic linear programming. Can you explain this connection and how it naturally leads to handling constraints through slack variables?

3) For the inequality constrained case, the paper introduces slack variables and derives a primal-dual formulation. Can you walk through the derivations and how they lead to the update steps in the algorithm? 

4) The paper proves an exponential approximation bound when using entropic regularization for constrained optimal transport. Can you summarize the proof technique and assumptions required? How does the bound compare to the unconstrained case?

5) One of the main results is a sublinear convergence rate for the proposed algorithm under fairly general conditions. Can you sketch the proof approach through the Lyapunov function and how the greedy update steps are analyzed? 

6) Acceleration techniques like dynamic regularization scheduling and Newton-type methods are proposed. Can you explain the key ideas there and how they extend similar techniques for unconstrained problems? What modifications were required?

7) For the Newton-based acceleration, the paper uses an approximate sparsity approach. What causes the Hessian matrix to be approximately sparse and how is this exploited algorithmically?

8) The experiments showcase very rapid convergence empirically. Can you summarize what is shown and discuss whether it matches the theory? Are there any interesting open questions?

9) The algorithm is equivalent to a Bregman projection method in the equality constrained case. Can you sketch the derivation showing the connection? When might the projection view be preferred?

10) How useful do you think this method could be in machine learning applications needing to solve constrained optimal transport problems? Can you name some potential use cases and how it could impact them?
