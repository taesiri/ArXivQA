# [SPAR: Personalized Content-Based Recommendation via Long Engagement   Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10555)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing content-based recommendation systems struggle to effectively process long sequences of user engagement history text (over 5K tokens). Methods that encode history contents separately fail to capture cross-content interactions. Approaches that fuse user-candidate information early on result in non-standalone representations, posing deployment challenges.  

Proposed Solution - SPAR:
- Proposes a framework to obtain standalone user and candidate embeddings while extracting fine-grained features from long engagement history texts. 
- Employs a pretrained language model (PLM) and poly-attention layers in a session-based manner with sparse attention to encode user history hierarchically.
- Further enriches user history by utilizing a large language model to summarize user interests.
- Applies additional poly-attention layers to derive multiple user and candidate embeddings for sufficient post-interaction.

Main Contributions:
- Novel combination of poly-attention and sparse attention mechanisms to summarize lengthy user history efficiently while capturing both local and global user interests.
- Obtains standalone user and candidate representations to support retrieval systems, while also enhancing their post-interaction.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art content recommendation methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving significant AUC improvements of 1.48% on MIND and 1.15% on Goodreads dataset.
- Provides extensive ablation studies validating the impact of key components like sparse attention, user interest summarization, multiple user/candidate embeddings, etc.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative recommendation framework called SPAR that leverages poly-attention strategies to effectively process long user engagement histories for superior personalized recommendations, with standalone user/candidate embeddings.
