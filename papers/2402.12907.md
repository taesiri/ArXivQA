# [Incentive Compatibility for AI Alignment in Sociotechnical Systems:   Positions and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing AI alignment research focuses primarily on technical components like data, models, training algorithms etc, neglecting the sociotechnical nature of AI systems. This can lead to a gap between an AI system's development and its actual deployment context, limiting real-world safety.

- There is a lack of effective means to simultaneously address both the technical and societal facets of AI systems to enable consensus between AI capabilities and human values across different contexts. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new problem - Incentive Compatibility Sociotechnical Alignment Problem (ICSAP) - exploring how to leverage incentive compatibility (IC) from game theory to align AI systems with human values and intentions. 

- IC suggests participants can just pursue self-interests and still achieve optimal outcomes aligned with the game designer's goals. This concept can be used in AI alignment.

- The paper illustrates how three classical game problems that achieve IC - mechanism design, contract theory and Bayesian persuasion - can be applied to solve ICSAP.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies sociotechnical gap in current AI alignment work, lacking joint technical and societal considerations.

- Formulates new problem - ICSAP - bringing attention to using IC for AI alignment in sociotechnical systems.

- Discusses prospects and challenges of using mechanism design, contract theory and Bayesian persuasion for achieving IC in ICSAP scenarios. 

- Calls for more research exploring IC for enabling AI consensus with human values across different contexts, addressing both technical and societal facets.

In summary, the paper makes a strong case for the value of incentive compatibility in bridging the sociotechnical divide in AI alignment research and enabling human-AI consensus across contexts. It sets the stage for further work on ICSAP.
