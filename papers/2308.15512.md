# [Shatter and Gather: Learning Referring Image Segmentation with Text   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15512)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we learn referring image segmentation in a weakly supervised manner using only image-text pairs as supervision?The key points related to this question are:- Referring image segmentation enables segmenting arbitrary entities described in free-form text queries. This is useful for many applications but requires costly labeling of training data.- The authors propose a weakly supervised approach that uses only image-text pairs, without needing segmentation masks, to train the model. This reduces annotation cost.- Their method consists of a bottom-up module to discover visual entities and a top-down module to select relevant entities based on the text query. - A new "entity slot" approach is proposed to enable fine-grained discovery of entities.- A contrastive cycle-consistency loss allows training the model without extra supervision by enforcing consistency between image-text pairs.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that referring image segmentation can be learned using only image-text pairs as supervision, through the proposed model architecture and training approach. The experiments then validate this hypothesis by showing strong performance compared to supervised methods and other weakly supervised baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. A new weakly supervised learning model for referring image segmentation that uses only image-text pairs for training. The model employs bottom-up and top-down attention to discover individual entities in an image and infer their relevance to a referring expression. 2. A new loss function called contrastive cycle-consistency (C^3) loss that allows the model to be trained without requiring any segmentation mask supervision. This loss enforces cycle-consistency between matching image-text pairs.3. Evaluation on four public benchmarks shows the proposed method substantially outperforms prior weakly supervised methods and recent open-vocabulary segmentation models, even without large-scale pretraining.In summary, the key ideas are using bottom-up and top-down attention to exploit relations between entities mentioned in referring expressions for weakly supervised training, and the C^3 loss that establishes cycle-consistency between images and texts to guide the learning process without mask labels. The results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for referring image segmentation using only image-text pairs.
