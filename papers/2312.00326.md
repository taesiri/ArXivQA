# [Agent-OM: Leveraging Large Language Models for Ontology Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00326)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Agent-OM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents for ontology matching (OM). The framework consists of two Siamese agents with planning, tools, and memory modules. It implements a set of intuitive prompt-based OM tools like entity retrievers, matchers, summarizers and validators that mitigate LLM limitations. Evaluated on three OAEI tracks, Agent-OM achieves very close results to state-of-the-art systems on simple tasks and significantly outperforms on complex tasks. The framework is highly generic, reusable and scalable. It represents a new paradigm for OM systems by simulating human reasoning. While observations indicate LLMs have advantages in learning context, self-correction and reasoning for OM, challenges still exist regarding tradeoffs, complex reasoning, hallucinations and prompt engineering. Overall, the paper demonstrates strong potential in using LLMs and agents for OM via careful prompt design.
