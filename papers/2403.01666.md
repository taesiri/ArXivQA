# [Improving Adversarial Energy-Based Model via Diffusion Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01666)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Energy-based models (EBMs) define flexible unnormalized density models and are useful for density estimation, but they are difficult to train due to the intractable normalization constant. Adversarial EBMs avoid expensive MCMC sampling by introducing a generator network, but have several limitations: (1) Minimax training can be unstable if generator and EBM optimizations are unbalanced. (2) Relying solely on KL divergence for generator training is insufficient. (3) Optimizing the generator requires computing intractable entropy terms.

Solution:
The paper proposes a Denoising Diffusion Adversarial EBM (DDAEBM) which incorporates a sequence of conditional EBMs into a denoising diffusion process. By splitting long generations into smaller steps, each conditional EBM matches a simpler conditional denoising distribution instead of complex marginal data distribution. For generator training, a symmetric Jeffrey divergence is employed and a variational posterior distribution is introduced to compute the entropy term.

Contributions:
- First framework incorporating adversarial EBMs into a diffusion process, avoiding MCMC during both training and sampling.
- Learns conditional EBMs on simpler denoising distributions instead of complex marginal distributions.  
- Uses Jeffrey divergence and variational posterior distribution for generator training to address main challenges in adversarial EBMs.
- Achieves significantly improved sample quality over previous adversarial EBMs and provides useful densities.
- Reduces gap between adversarial EBMs and mainstream generative models in terms of sample quality and density estimation.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective framework for training high-quality adversarial EBMs by incorporating them into a diffusion process and addressing main training challenges. This leads to state-of-the-art results among adversarial EBM methods.
