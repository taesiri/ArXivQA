# [ClassEval: A Manually-Crafted Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on   Class-level Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01861)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How do large language models (LLMs) perform on the more challenging task of class-level code generation compared to simpler function-level code generation benchmarks like HumanEval?

The key hypotheses examined in the paper are:

1) LLMs will show worse performance on class-level code generation tasks compared to standalone function-level tasks.

2) The rankings of LLM performance on function-level tasks may not hold for class-level tasks. 

3) Different code generation strategies (holistic, incremental, compositional) may be better suited for different LLMs on class-level tasks.

4) LLMs may have difficulty generating code that depends on other contexts like fields and methods within a class.

To test these hypotheses, the authors construct a new benchmark of class-level coding tasks called ClassEval and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art LLMs using different generation strategies. The key findings validate the worse performance of LLMs on class-level tasks, changes in LLM rankings, and limitations in generating dependent code. Overall, the paper provides new insights into LLM capabilities on more complex, class-level code generation compared to simpler function-level benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper presents the first benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on class-level code generation tasks. Specifically, the authors manually construct a new benchmark called ClassEval with 100 class-level Python code generation tasks. Constructing this benchmark involves significant manual effort (around 500 person-hours) to create class skeletons, test cases, and solutions for each task. 

2. The paper performs an empirical study using the ClassEval benchmark to evaluate 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on class-level code generation. The study explores different code generation strategies like holistic, incremental, and compositional generation. The results reveal insights about the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs for more complex, class-level code generation compared to simpler function-level tasks.

3. The key findings from the study are:

- LLMs demonstrate much lower performance on class-level tasks compared to function-level tasks. Their function-level abilities do not necessarily reflect class-level abilities. This highlights the need for class-level benchmarks like ClassEval.

- GPT-3 and GPT-4 still dominate other LLMs on class-level generation, while models like Codex, Instruct-CodeGen, and WizardCoder form the next tier.

- Holistic generation works best only for GPT models. Other LLMs perform better with incremental or compositional method-by-method generation.

- Models struggle to generate code dependent on other methods, compared to field accesses. 

- Common errors include AttributeError and TypeError, indicating difficulties in satisfying constraints.

Overall, the paper presents the first dedicated class-level code generation benchmark ClassEval, and uses it to provide novel insights into evaluating more complex coding abilities of LLMs compared to simpler function-level tasks. The benchmark and findings highlight promising future research directions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here are some key comparisons of this paper to other related work in the field of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on code generation:

- This paper presents the first study focused specifically on evaluating LLMs on class-level code generation. Most prior work has focused on simpler function-level or statement-level generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. The new ClassEval benchmark fills an important gap by assessing model performance on more complex, interdependent code generation.

- The paper includes experiments with 11 state-of-the-art LLMs, making it one of the most comprehensive comparative studies on code generation. Many prior works have only evaluated 1-3 models on a given benchmark. Covering a diverse set of models provides useful insights into factors like model size, training data, and architecture design.

- The study explores multiple code generation strategies like holistic, incremental, and compositional generation. Most prior work looks at standalone generation, while this paper shows how performance can vary significantly depending on the approach used.

- The new benchmark ClassEval is manually constructed to avoid train/test data leakage issues in some prior automated benchmarks based on public code data. The rigorous human-in-the-loop process improves benchmark quality.

- The paper provides useful error analysis to identify common challenges LLMs still face in handling class dependencies and generating valid interdependent code. This helps pinpoint areas for improvement in future model development.

Overall, this work makes excellent progress in designing more realistic benchmarks and providing insights into LLM code generation capabilities. The focus on class-level generation and comprehensive model evaluation are significant contributions compared to prior literature. The findings help guide research towards developing LLMs better suited for practical, real-world software development scenarios.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding the scale and diversity of the class-level code generation benchmark by including more programming languages, more topics/domains, and more complicated tasks. The current benchmark has limitations in size and generalizability.

- Continuing to explore different prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques to further improve LLMs' performance on class-level code generation. The prompts and tuning approaches may have a big impact on results.

- Investigating new model architectures or training objectives tailored for class-level code generation. The authors mention the current models still show limitations in capturing dependencies. New architectures or objectives could help. 

- Enhancing LLMs' ability to generate method-dependent code and properly handle class fields and contexts. The error analysis shows models still struggle with dependencies.

- Evaluating how well class-level code generation transfers to more realistic software engineering scenarios. The benchmark is simplified - applying models to real-world tasks is an important next step.

- Exploring human-AI collaboration for class-level code generation, like having both humans and LLMs jointly complete the coding tasks.

- Developing enhanced debugging and error handling capabilities when LLMs generate incorrect code. This could identify common failure cases and improve results.

- Studying how to better leverage class-level information during training, instead of only using function-level data, to improve generalization.

So in summary, expanding the benchmark, improving prompting and training strategies, handling dependencies better, testing more realistic scenarios, and integrating human collaboration are some of the key future directions highlighted. The results show big room for improvement on class-level generation.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ClassEval, a new benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on class-level code generation tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on simpler function-level code generation, ClassEval asks models to generate full Python classes with multiple interdependent methods. The authors manually constructed ClassEval over approximately 500 person-hours, with each of the 100 tasks consisting of a class skeleton, test cases, and a canonical solution. The benchmark covers diverse practical coding topics and requires generating longer code snippets with intricate dependencies between methods. 

Based on ClassEval, the authors perform an empirical study of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs with different generation strategies. The key findings are: 1) LLMs exhibit significantly lower performance on class-level tasks compared to standalone function-level tasks, indicating the difficulty of generating complex code, 2) GPT-4 and GPT-3 maintain dominance but other models like CodeX show similar performance, 3) Holistic generation works best only for GPT models while others prefer stepwise method-by-method generation, 4) Generating field accesses is easier than method invocations for all models, and 5) Common errors include misunderstanding dependencies and violating syntactic/semantic constraints. Overall, ClassEval represents a challenging new benchmark for more comprehensive LLM evaluation on practical software development tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my review, the main method used in the paper can be summarized as follows: 

The paper manually constructs a new benchmark for evaluating large language models on class-level code generation tasks. The benchmark, named ClassEval, consists of 100 class-level coding tasks in Python that are manually created through a rigorous process involving approximately 500 person-hours of effort. Each task comprises a class skeleton that outlines the class structure, a test suite with high coverage for verifying correctness, and a canonical solution as the reference implementation. The benchmark focuses on generating classes containing multiple methods with diverse contextual dependencies, distinguishing it from existing benchmarks that evaluate standalone function-level code generation. 

The authors then conduct an empirical study evaluating 11 state-of-the-art large language models on the new benchmark using different generation strategies - holistic, incremental and compositional. The models exhibit significantly lower performance on the more challenging class-level tasks compared to method-level tasks in existing benchmarks. While GPT-4 and GPT-3 maintain dominance, other models like InstructCodeGen and WizardCoder perform similarly. The study provides insights into model capabilities on long-form generation and handling dependencies, while also analyzing error patterns in generated classes. Overall, the manually constructed benchmark and rigorous empirical analysis help advance the understanding and evaluation of large language models on more practical class-level code generation scenarios.
