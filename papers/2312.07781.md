# [Combining propensity score methods with variational autoencoders for   generating synthetic data in presence of latent sub-groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-quality synthetic data from clinical cohorts is important for data privacy and other applications, but faithfully preserving heterogeneity across patients is challenging. 
- Heterogeneity may be due to known sub-groups with labels, or unknown sub-groups reflected only in distribution properties like bimodality.  
- Standard deep learning techniques like VAEs struggle with such complex distributions.

Proposed Solution:
- Complement VAEs with pre-transformations to handle unknown sub-groups and recover complex marginal distributions. Specifically, use Box-Cox transforms for skewness and a power transform to reduce bimodality.
- For known sub-groups, estimate propensity scores on the original variables and visualize them on the VAE latent space. Use propensity scores to guide weighted sampling from the VAE prior.

Main Contributions:
- Pre-transformation enhanced VAE approach that can recover bimodal and skewed distributions in synthetic clinical data.
- Novel way to complement VAEs with propensity scores for known sub-groups, enabling guided sampling to control or preserve group-specific characteristics.
- Quantitative and visual evaluation on realistic simulations and international stroke trial data showing the approach works well.
- The proposed statistical modeling complements VAEs for high-quality synthetic data generation from heterogeneous clinical cohorts.

In summary, the key innovation is augmenting VAEs with pre-transformations and propensity scores to address heterogeneity in the form of complex marginal distributions and known sub-groups when generating synthetic clinical cohort data. This enables new ways to faithfully preserve or control the heterogeneity.
