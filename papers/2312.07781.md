# [Combining propensity score methods with variational autoencoders for   generating synthetic data in presence of latent sub-groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-quality synthetic data from clinical cohorts is important for data privacy and other applications, but faithfully preserving heterogeneity across patients is challenging. 
- Heterogeneity may be due to known sub-groups with labels, or unknown sub-groups reflected only in distribution properties like bimodality.  
- Standard deep learning techniques like VAEs struggle with such complex distributions.

Proposed Solution:
- Complement VAEs with pre-transformations to handle unknown sub-groups and recover complex marginal distributions. Specifically, use Box-Cox transforms for skewness and a power transform to reduce bimodality.
- For known sub-groups, estimate propensity scores on the original variables and visualize them on the VAE latent space. Use propensity scores to guide weighted sampling from the VAE prior.

Main Contributions:
- Pre-transformation enhanced VAE approach that can recover bimodal and skewed distributions in synthetic clinical data.
- Novel way to complement VAEs with propensity scores for known sub-groups, enabling guided sampling to control or preserve group-specific characteristics.
- Quantitative and visual evaluation on realistic simulations and international stroke trial data showing the approach works well.
- The proposed statistical modeling complements VAEs for high-quality synthetic data generation from heterogeneous clinical cohorts.

In summary, the key innovation is augmenting VAEs with pre-transformations and propensity scores to address heterogeneity in the form of complex marginal distributions and known sub-groups when generating synthetic clinical cohort data. This enables new ways to faithfully preserve or control the heterogeneity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes combining variational autoencoders with pre-transformations and propensity score modeling to generate synthetic clinical cohort data that faithfully preserves heterogeneity due to both known and unknown sub-groups.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an approach to generate high-quality synthetic clinical cohort data that faithfully preserves heterogeneity due to both known and unknown sub-groups. Specifically:

1) To deal with unknown sub-groups reflected in marginal distributions, the paper proposes combining VAEs with pre-transformations like Box-Cox and power transformations to recover bimodal and skewed distributions. This allows the VAE to better model the data.

2) To deal with known sub-groups, the paper proposes complementing the VAE latent space representation with propensity score modeling. Propensity scores calculated on the original data space provide complementary information about sub-group membership that can guide weighted sampling from the VAE latent space. This allows control over sampling data with or without sub-group specific characteristics.

In summary, the key insight is that combining deep learning techniques like VAEs with more traditional statistical approaches like pre-transformations and propensity score modeling enables generating synthetic data that realistically preserves sub-group heterogeneity, both known and unknown. The utility of this approach is demonstrated on a simulated dataset and a real international stroke trial dataset.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining VAEs with pre-transformations to handle unknown sub-group structures reflected in marginal distributions. What is the intuition behind using pre-transformations instead of just modifying the VAE architecture or loss function? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages?

2. The Box-Cox and power transformations are used as pre-transformations. What other types of transformations could be explored? How can the choice of pre-transformations be optimized in an automated way? 

3. The paper uses propensity scores to handle known sub-group structures. What other methods for subgroup modeling could be combined with VAEs? What are the tradeoffs to consider?

4. The propensity scores are visualized in the VAE latent space to guide weighted sampling. What other ways could the propensity scores inform the VAE training or sampling? Could they be incorporated into the loss function?

5. The paper evaluates performance using utility metrics and by examining reconstructed marginal distributions. What other quantitative and qualitative ways could the synthetic data quality be evaluated? 

6. The simulation study is based on a breast cancer dataset. How could the proposed approach be validated on a wider range of complex real-world datasets from other domains?

7. The sample sizes used in the experiments are relatively small. How would the approach perform on larger datasets? Would the computational expense significantly increase?

8. The paper focuses on generating both continuous and binary variables. How could the approach be extended to handle categorical, count, and other variable types?

9. What optimizations could be made to the VAE architecture, such as using normalizing flows or hierarchical VAEs, to improve modeling of complex joint distributions?

10. The proposed weighted sampling requires selecting parameters like the cell size for discretization. How sensitive are the results to these hyperparameter choices? Could they be set in an adaptive, data-driven manner?
