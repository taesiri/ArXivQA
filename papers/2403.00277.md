# [Gender Bias in Large Language Models across Multiple Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00277)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various applications, assessing and mitigating biases embedded in them is crucial.  
- Prior work on evaluating gender bias in LLMs focuses mainly on English and uses limited evaluation methods. Comprehensive analysis across languages and evaluation dimensions is lacking.

Proposed Solution
- The paper proposes three measurements to evaluate gender bias in LLM generations across multiple languages:
  1. Bias in descriptive word selection: Checks if certain descriptive words are more likely to be predicted for a particular gender.
  2. Bias in gendered role selection: Checks if LLMs associate certain descriptive words more with a specific gendered pronoun.
  3. Bias in dialogue topics: Checks if sentiment reflected in LLM-generated dialogues differs based on gender pairings.
  
- Experiments were conducted using GPT models across six languages - English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

Main Contributions
- Demonstrated existence of gender bias in LLM generations across languages using three evaluation measurements.
- Lexicon and sentiment aspects of gender bias were analyzed providing insights into how diverse instructions can influence bias.
- Variations were found in how gender bias manifests across languages indicating influence of regional cultures.
- Proposed methodology and findings will assist future efforts to mitigate gender bias in LLM texts.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive multilingual analysis of gender bias in LLMs using novel measurements that evaluate both word associations and dialogues. Key results show gender bias persists across languages and manifests in varied forms based on regional cultures.
