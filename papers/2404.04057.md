# [Score identity Distillation: Exponentially Fast Distillation of   Pretrained Diffusion Models for One-Step Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04057)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Diffusion models can generate high-quality images but require multiple iterative refinement steps during generation, making them computationally expensive. The paper aims to distill the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion models into an efficient single-step generator.

Method - Score Identity Distillation (SiD):
- Models the forward diffusion as a semi-implicit distribution to derive three score-related identities. 
- Proposes distilling via model-based score matching loss between the scores of diffused real and fake distributions.
- Approximates the intractable loss using the score identities and Monte Carlo estimation.
- The resulting loss trains the single-step generator on its own synthesized images without needing real data.

Contributions:
- Introduces an innovative data-free diffusion model distillation method without reverse diffusion.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art single-step image generation quality, outperforming the teacher diffusion models.
- Demonstrates rapid exponential decrease in FID during training.
- Sets new benchmarks in efficiency and effectiveness for diffusion distillation.
- Simplifies diffusion distillation by eliminating the need for real training data.

The method is validated on CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64x64, FFHQ 64x64 and AFHQv2 64x64 datasets by distilling the EDM diffusion models. The single-step SiD generator outperforms EDM and other state-of-the-art techniques in sample quality and training efficiency.
