# [Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can store factual knowledge and provide explanations. However, they may still give outdated information or hallucinate, which is concerning for real-world medical applications.  
- Existing model editing techniques struggle with the complexity and specialization of medical language when modifying LLMs' medical knowledge and explanation abilities.

Methodology:
- The authors propose two preliminary studies on medical LLM editing: (1) editing factual medical knowledge to ensure up-to-date information, and (2) editing explanations to facts to mitigate hallucinations.
- They construct two benchmarks, MedCF and MedFE, to evaluate editing approaches on efficacy, generality, locality and fluency. More challenging locality metrics are introduced.  
- They propose MedLaSA, a novel layer-wise scalable adapter strategy. It employs causal tracing to identify knowledge locations in neurons. Scalable adapters are then introduced into LLM layers based on that knowledge to enable automatic discrimination between editing and non-editing data.

Experiments:
- Experiments were conducted on MedCF and MedFE using medical LLMs ChatDoctor and Meditron.
- MedLaSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art editing methods across metrics due to its ability to handle complex medical knowledge without largely modifying unrelated knowledge.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the effects of critical components in MedLaSA.

Main Contributions:
- First to explore medical LLM editing for factual knowledge and explanatory abilities.
- Construct specialized benchmarks for evaluation with comprehensive metrics. 
- Propose MedLaSA that associates knowledge to layers and applies tailored scaling adapters for efficient medical editing.
