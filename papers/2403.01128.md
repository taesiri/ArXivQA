# [Sensitivity Analysis On Loss Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sensitivity analysis is challenging, especially for non-linear and complex datasets. Conventional methods like statistical correlations have limitations in detecting non-linear relationships and providing a deeper understanding of how independent variables influence the dependent variable.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel sensitivity analysis approach by exploring the loss landscape of a neural network using the first, second, and third order derivatives of the loss function. 

- A simple neural network model is set up with specific choices of activation functions like tanh. The model is trained while storing the derivatives and loss values using automatic differentiation.

- Second order gradients are analyzed to identify features that are increasing vs decreasing as loss reduces. It is observed that features with positive/negative Spearman correlation values align with increasing/decreasing second order gradients.

- Thus, second order gradients can provide insights similar to statistical correlation analysis, but with the ability to capture non-linear relationships as well. First and third order gradients also provide useful insights.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates how gradient-based analysis of the loss landscape can be an effective sensitivity analysis technique, overcoming limitations of conventional statistical methods

- Reveals that second order gradients can detect monotonic as well as non-linear relationships between independent and dependent variables

- Provides intuitive visualizations to compare second order gradients with statistical correlation analyses

- Showcases the additional insights that can be obtained from first and third order derivatives 

- Discusses a potential application of using gradients for selective attention in images, analogous to the human eye's blind spot

In summary, the paper presents a novel sensitivity analysis approach using derivatives to deeply explore the loss landscape, offering valuable insights beyond conventional practices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper explores sensitivity analysis through visualizing the loss landscape of a neural network using the first three derivatives to understand the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is presenting a novel approach to conducting sensitivity analysis by exploring the loss landscape using the first, second, and third derivatives of the loss function. Specifically:

- The paper shows that by observing the patterns of second-order gradients during training, insights can be gained that are similar to those given by Spearman's correlation coefficient in terms of understanding which independent variables have a significant impact on the dependent variable. However, the second-order gradient approach also detects non-linear relationships, unlike Spearman's correlation.

- The study underscores the value of visualizing the relationships between variables through retraining and plotting of the derivatives. Rather than focusing only on extensive model training for maximum accuracy, the method provides a way to gain a deeper intuition about the loss landscape and the sensitivity of the outputs to changes in inputs.

- Overall, the paper highlights the importance of thorough sensitivity analysis using derivatives and loss landscape visualization for enhancing model robustness, exposing theoretical foundations, and moving beyond conventional practices.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a derivative-based, loss landscape visualization approach for an advanced sensitivity analysis that can handle non-linear relationships and provide deeper insights.
