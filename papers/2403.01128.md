# [Sensitivity Analysis On Loss Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sensitivity analysis is challenging, especially for non-linear and complex datasets. Conventional methods like statistical correlations have limitations in detecting non-linear relationships and providing a deeper understanding of how independent variables influence the dependent variable.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel sensitivity analysis approach by exploring the loss landscape of a neural network using the first, second, and third order derivatives of the loss function. 

- A simple neural network model is set up with specific choices of activation functions like tanh. The model is trained while storing the derivatives and loss values using automatic differentiation.

- Second order gradients are analyzed to identify features that are increasing vs decreasing as loss reduces. It is observed that features with positive/negative Spearman correlation values align with increasing/decreasing second order gradients.

- Thus, second order gradients can provide insights similar to statistical correlation analysis, but with the ability to capture non-linear relationships as well. First and third order gradients also provide useful insights.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates how gradient-based analysis of the loss landscape can be an effective sensitivity analysis technique, overcoming limitations of conventional statistical methods

- Reveals that second order gradients can detect monotonic as well as non-linear relationships between independent and dependent variables

- Provides intuitive visualizations to compare second order gradients with statistical correlation analyses

- Showcases the additional insights that can be obtained from first and third order derivatives 

- Discusses a potential application of using gradients for selective attention in images, analogous to the human eye's blind spot

In summary, the paper presents a novel sensitivity analysis approach using derivatives to deeply explore the loss landscape, offering valuable insights beyond conventional practices.
