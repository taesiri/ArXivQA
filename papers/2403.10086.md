# [Large Language Models to Generate System-Level Test Programs Targeting   Non-functional Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- System-Level Test (SLT) is important for testing complex Systems-on-Chip but manually creating SLT programs is challenging and time-consuming. 
- There are no systematic approaches for generating SLT programs targeting non-functional properties like temperature.
- Traditional test generation methods using fault models are infeasible for SLT due to the complexity and lack of structural information about the device under test (DUT).

Proposed Solution:
- Use Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate SLT test programs targeting non-functional properties of the DUT. 
- Specifically, generate C code snippets that maximize instructions per cycle (IPC) of a simulated super-scalar processor, as a proxy for temperature.
- Engineer a prompt for Code Llama LLM giving constraints and optimization goals.
- Apply prompt optimization using prompt-optimizer and hyperparameter optimization with Optuna to improve results.

Main Contributions:
- First work examining feasibility of using LLMs for automated generation of system-level test programs.
- Demonstrated generating C code targeting high IPC on a processor simulation using Code Llama, prompt optimization and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.  
- Showed care is needed in prompt engineering to achieve validity and optimization goals for generated programs.
- Analysis of quality of generated programs using pass@k metric.
- Future work proposed on LLM fine-tuning and further prompt enhancements.

The paper makes an important first step in leveraging recent advances in LLMs for the challenging problem of automated generation of system-level test programs targeting non-functional properties. Careful prompt design and optimization is shown to achieve promising initial results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes using large language models to automatically generate system-level test programs targeting non-functional properties like instructions per cycle for hardware testing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate system-level test (SLT) programs that target non-functional properties of the device under test (DUT). Specifically, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of using LLMs to generate C code snippets that maximize the instructions per cycle (IPC) of a simulated processor. They engineer a prompt for the Code Llama LLM to generate high IPC code, and use prompt and hyperparameter optimization to achieve good results without further LLM training. Although more work is needed, this is an initial demonstration that LLMs can be useful for automatically generating SLT programs targeting non-functional properties like IPC.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) for system-level test (SLT) program generation. What are some key challenges in adapting LLMs for this purpose compared to other code generation tasks? For example, how can the non-functional optimization objective be effectively communicated?

2. The authors use instructions per cycle (IPC) as a proxy metric for temperature. What are some other potential proxy metrics that could be relevant SLT objectives? How might the choice of metric impact the prompting strategy? 

3. What types of constraints need to be encoded in the prompt to ensure the generated programs are valid SLT programs for the device under test? For example, what contextual information is required?

4. The paper uses Code Llama, a 13B parameter model. How might the choice of model size and architecture impact the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach? What are relevant tradeoffs to consider?  

5. What other prompt engineering techniques beyond those explored could be beneficial? For example, how could providing more exemplar programs or a curriculum strategy improve results?

6. The authors use prompt optimization and hyperparameter optimization. What are some challenges in effectively navigating this joint search space? How can the techniques be adapted to scale more efficiently?

7. The pass@k metric indicates reasonable success rates, but how could the likelihood of getting valid, high-IPC programs be further improved? What changes to the method could help?

8. How brittle is the approach to changes in simulation environments and ISAs? What could make it more robust and generalizable?

9. The authors note more prompt engineering is needed. What are some theories on why the model struggles with appropriately responding to the IPC concept? How can understanding failures inform prompt design?

10. The method is evaluated in simulation. What adaptations would be necessary to apply it for SLT program generation targeting real hardware? What new challenges might emerge?
