# [Understanding and Robustifying Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09656)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. Why does DARTS (Differentiable Architecture Search) sometimes fail to find good neural network architectures, yielding degenerate architectures with poor test performance?

2. Is there a relationship between the curvature/sharpness of the validation loss landscape and the generalization performance of architectures found by DARTS? 

3. Can DARTS be made more robust by regularizing the inner training objective during architecture search to alter the loss landscape and steer optimization towards flatter minima that generalize better?

In particular, the paper seems to investigate:

- Several cases where standard DARTS fails to find good architectures on new search spaces/datasets (Section 3)

- Whether the dominant eigenvalues of the Hessian of the validation loss indicate sharp vs flat minima that impact architecture generalization (Section 4) 

- How regularization of the inner objective (via data augmentation or L2 penalty) impacts the sharpness and guides DARTS towards better architectures (Section 5)

- Simple methods to make DARTS more robust, like early stopping based on eigenvalues, or using multiple regularizations (Section 6)

So in summary, the main goals are to understand when and why standard DARTS fails, connect sharpness of the architecture search space to generalization, and develop more robust versions of DARTS.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Identifying 12 neural architecture search (NAS) benchmarks based on four search spaces where standard Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) yields architectures with poor test performance.

2. Showing there is a strong correlation between the dominant eigenvalue of the validation loss Hessian matrix with respect to the architectural parameters and the architecture's generalization error. Based on this, they propose an early stopping criterion for DARTS.

3. Demonstrating that regularizing the inner objective of DARTS more strongly (via data augmentation or L2 regularization) allows it to find architectures with smaller Hessian spectra and better generalization. This leads to two practical robustifications of DARTS. 

4. Evaluating the proposed methods, including early stopping, adaptive regularization, and multiple regularized DARTS runs, which overcome failure modes and substantially improve robustness. The methods are evaluated across 5 search spaces on 3 image classification tasks and also for disparity estimation and language modeling.

In summary, the main contribution is identifying issues with standard DARTS, relating them to curvature and generalization, and proposing simple yet effective solutions to make DARTS more robust across tasks and search spaces. The paper provides useful analysis and insights for making NAS methods like DARTS more reliable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a few simple modifications to the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method to make it more robust, by regularizing the inner training objective and using early stopping or multiple runs with different regularization strengths. These changes help avoid poor solutions with large Hessian eigenvalues and curvature, which correlate with worse generalization, across a diverse range of architecture search spaces and tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS):

- Focuses on understanding and improving the robustness of DARTS: This paper aims to analyze the failure modes of the popular DARTS algorithm for DNAS and proposes modifications to make it more robust. Much other DNAS research has focused on developing new methods rather than understanding and enhancing existing ones like DARTS. 

- Identifies relationship between architecture Hessian eigenvalues and generalization: A key finding is that large dominant eigenvalues of the architecture Hessian correlate with poor generalization performance of the discovered architectures. This connects DNAS optimization to the broader research area of flat vs sharp minima.

- Tests robustness across diverse search spaces and tasks: The authors systematically test DARTS and variants across 12 search spaces on image classification, disparity estimation, and language modeling. This evaluates robustness more thoroughly than much prior work.

- Regularization improves robustness: Adding regularization like data augmentation or L2 during architecture search is shown to improve the robustness of DARTS across tasks. This simple but effective technique contrasts many proposed elaborate new DNAS algorithms.

- Practical methods for enhancing DARTS: Simple methods like early stopping, adaptive regularization, and running multiple regularized DARTS runs are provided as easy ways to enhance DARTS in practice. The focus on practical guidance for practitioners is valuable.

Overall, this paper provides useful analysis and insights into the training dynamics and failure modes of DARTS. The emphasis on robustness, connections to generalization theory, and practical enhancements differentiate it from much other DNAS research focused on novel algorithms. The rigorous benchmarking provides a model for thorough NAS evaluation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further analysis of the relationship between Hessian eigenvalues and generalization error. The authors show there is a correlation, but more work could be done to understand the theoretical underpinnings of this relationship.

- Developing better ways to regularize the inner objective function in DARTS. The authors show that techniques like data augmentation and L2 regularization help, but more advanced regularization methods could further improve DARTS' robustness. 

- Exploring other ways to avoid sharp minima and control curvature besides early stopping and regularization. For example, new optimization techniques could potentially guide the search away from high curvature regions.

- Extending the robustified DARTS approaches to other tasks and domains beyond image classification. The authors demonstrate results on disparity estimation and language modeling, but more work is needed to determine if the conclusions generalize.

- Analyzing how well robustified DARTS works on the original DARTS search spaces, compared to the reduced spaces mainly studied in the paper. The authors provide some initial results, but more investigation would be useful.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why DARTS fails in certain scenarios, and when the proposed robustification methods are guaranteed to work. The paper's empirical results could inform new theory.

- Studying whether insights from robustifying DARTS could generalize to making other NAS approaches more robust. The concepts like controlling eigenvalues could potentially transfer.

So in summary, the authors point to several interesting directions, including better understanding the theory, improving regularization, generalizing the methods, and extending the analysis to other NAS techniques. Advancing any of these areas could build nicely on this paper's foundations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper focuses on understanding and overcoming failure modes of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). The authors identify several search spaces where standard DARTS yields poor architectures with low test performance. They show this is related to DARTS minimizing sharp regions of the validation loss landscape, characterized by large dominant eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. Based on this, they propose an early stopping criterion that tracks the largest eigenvalue and stops when it grows too large. They also show that increased regularization of the inner objective helps guide DARTS to flatter minima and better architectures. Their analysis is conducted across various image classification datasets and search spaces, as well as for disparity estimation and language modeling. The proposed methods, especially combining early stopping and regularization, yield a robustified version of DARTS that avoids poor solutions across many benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an analysis of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to understand and overcome its failure modes when applied to certain neural architecture search spaces. The authors identify several search spaces where standard DARTS yields poor architectures with high generalization error, even though it succeeds in minimizing the validation loss. By analyzing the curvature of the validation loss landscape, measured by the dominant eigenvalue of its Hessian matrix, they find a strong correlation between high curvature and poor generalization of the resulting architectures. 

Based on these insights, the authors propose several modifications to make DARTS more robust. First, they introduce an early stopping criterion based on the eigenvalue trajectory to avoid sharp regions of the loss landscape. Second, they show that stronger regularization of the inner training objective allows DARTS to find flatter minima and architectures that generalize better. The proposed methods, including adaptive regularization, early stopping, and running multiple DARTS instances with different regularization, are evaluated on several architecture search spaces and tasks. They are shown to substantially improve the robustness and test performance of architectures found by DARTS across the board.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a differentiable architecture search method called DARTS for designing neural network architectures automatically. The key ideas are:

- Relax the discrete architecture search space to be continuous by representing each network layer as a mixture of candidate operations weighted by architectural parameters. 

- Optimize both the network weights and architectural parameters by alternating gradient descent. The network weights are optimized on the training data to minimize the training loss (inner objective) while the architectural parameters are optimized on the validation data to minimize the validation loss (outer objective). 

- Approximate solving the inner optimization problem by only taking one gradient step on the network weights rather than fully optimizing them. This allows efficiently computing gradients of the validation loss with respect to the architectural parameters.

- At the end, discretize the architecture by choosing the top-k weighted operations per layer and retrain this network normally.

In summary, DARTS formulates architecture search as a continuous optimization problem by relaxing the search space and approximately solving the resulting bi-level optimization problem via alternating gradient descent steps on network weights and architectural parameters. This allows reducing the architecture search costs substantially compared to prior NAS methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the issue that the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method for neural architecture search can sometimes yield poor architectures that generalize poorly. 

- DARTS optimizes architecture parameters and model weights by approximating the bilevel optimization problem with gradient descent. However, the authors find that it can get stuck in regions of the architecture space that lead to poor test performance.

- The authors identify that larger eigenvalues of the Hessian of the validation loss with respect to the architecture parameters correlate with worse generalization performance. 

- To address this issue, the authors propose modifications to DARTS, including early stopping based on tracking the dominant eigenvalue, and adding regularization to the inner optimization objective.

- These modifications lead to architectures with better generalization that avoid sharp minima in the architecture space. The robustified DARTS methods substantially outperform standard DARTS across a range of architecture search spaces and tasks.

In summary, the key focus is on understanding and overcoming failure modes of DARTS, where it can get stuck in regions of the architecture space that generalize poorly. The authors relate this to sharp vs flat minima and propose practical methods to make DARTS more robust.

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a robustification of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by analyzing and avoiding its failure modes of finding architectures that generalize poorly. The key ideas are:

1) Standard DARTS often finds architectures dominated by parameterless skip connections that perform poorly. This happens across various search spaces and datasets.

2) There is a correlation between the dominant eigenvalue of the Hessian of the validation loss w.r.t. the architectural parameters and the generalization error. Large eigenvalues indicate poor generalization.

3) Regularizing the inner training loss of DARTS more strongly implicitly regularizes the architectural parameters, keeping eigenvalues small and leading to better generalization. This can be done via early stopping, stronger weight decay, or more aggressive data augmentation.

4) Based on these insights, robustified versions of DARTS are proposed that show much more consistent performance across tasks.

In summary, the paper provides an analysis of DARTS' failure modes and uses insights about flat vs. sharp minima to propose fixes that make DARTS substantially more robust in practice.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies why standard Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) often fails to find architectures that generalize well on new problems and datasets. The authors identify several search spaces where DARTS converges to architectures dominated by parameterless skip connections and pooling operations that achieve poor test performance. Through an analysis of the Hessian spectrum, they find these failure cases correlate with sharp local minima that overfit to the validation data. To address this issue, they propose and empirically validate two modifications: early stopping based on the dominant Hessian eigenvalue and stronger regularization of the inner objective function to flatten the architecture landscape. Their proposed robustified DARTS methods substantially outperform standard DARTS across the problematic search spaces and also generalize well on disparity estimation and language modeling tasks. Overall, this work provides useful insights into DARTS' failure modes and offers simple, practical solutions to make DARTS more robust.
