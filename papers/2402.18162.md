## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important capability for deploying machine learning models safely in the real world. However, current OOD detection methods rely on limited assumptions that constrain their effectiveness. There is a need to explore new perspectives for more reliable OOD detection. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a novel prior called Neural Activation Prior (NAP) for OOD detection. NAP is based on the key observation that in a trained neural network, a few neurons in a channel are significantly more likely to exhibit larger activation responses to an in-distribution sample compared to an out-of-distribution sample. Intuitively, each channel learns to detect certain patterns, and will have strongly activated neurons when those patterns occur in the input. Such strong responses are less likely for OOD inputs that do not contain those patterns.  

Based on NAP, a new SNR-inspired scoring function is developed by taking the ratio of maximum and average activation values within each channel. This function naturally highlights channels with strongly activated neurons. Being derived from pre-global-pooling activations, NAP provides complementary information to existing post-pooling methods.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the novel NAP prior that provides a new perspective for OOD detection.
- Develops a simple yet effective NAP-based scoring function that is plug-and-play, retains model accuracy, and complements existing methods.
- Achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating the power of the proposed NAP technique.
- Opens up new research directions by showing the utility of pre-global-pooling information for OOD detection.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions by introducing the NAP prior and showing how it can be effectively used to advance OOD detection capabilities. The presented results highlight the potential of leveraging new assumptions about model activations.
