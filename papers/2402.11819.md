# [Head-wise Shareable Attention for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from a huge number of parameters, restricting their deployment on edge devices due to limited storage and memory. 
- Existing weight sharing techniques focusing on small models like BERT employ coarse-grained sharing which becomes limiting for LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a perspective on head-wise shareable attention for LLMs.
- Propose two memory-efficient methods sharing parameters across attention heads of LLMs:
  - DirectShare: Directly reuse pre-trained weights based on cosine similarity of weight matrices between heads.
  - PostShare: Post-train with constraint on weight matrix similarity between selected heads to share, then share weights.

Main Contributions:  
- Investigate feasibility of head-wise weight sharing for LLMs.
- DirectShare is time-efficient, retains satisfactory performance when sharing ratio below 30%.
- PostShare yields better performance via post-training, especially at higher sharing ratios.  
- Experiments show comparable results to competitive memory-efficient methods on multiple datasets and tasks.
- Additional analysis indicates efficiency in small models like BERT and GPT.

In summary, this paper explores fine-grained head-wise weight sharing strategies for memory-efficient LLMs, proposes two complementary methods, and demonstrates their effectiveness empirically. The feasibility of applying such techniques to reduce redundancy while preserving diverse capabilities of LLMs is shown.

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. Investigating the feasibility of head-wise weight sharing for large language models and proposing two corresponding methods named \textbf{DirectShare} and \textbf{PostShare}.

2. The proposed \textbf{DirectShare} is time-efficient and retain a large portion of the performance when sharing ratio is below 30\%. Complementarily, \textbf{PostShare} yields satisfactory performance via post-training, especially under large ratios. 

3. Experimental results revealing the proposed methods achieve comparable performance to the competitive memory-efficient methods. Additional analysis also indicates the efficiency in small-scale models.

The paper focuses on exploring head-wise weight sharing strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) in order to improve their memory and parameter efficiency. The two main methods proposed are DirectShare and PostShare. Key concepts involved include sharing weight matrices across attention heads in the Multi-Head Attention blocks based on cosine similarity, with the goal of reducing parameters and memory usage while preserving model performance as much as possible.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two complementary methods: DirectShare and PostShare. What are the key differences between these two methods and what are the trade-offs involved in choosing one over the other?

2. The paper motivates the idea of head-wise weight sharing through an analysis of attention map similarity across heads. Can you explain this analysis and how it led to the proposed fine-grained weight sharing strategy? 

3. The paper uses a specific dynamic head matching strategy based on cosine similarity of the concatenated weight matrices Wq and Wk. What is the rationale behind this choice and how does it differ from other possible matching strategies analyzed in the paper?

4. For the PostShare method, the paper introduces a regularization term to encourage similarity of weights during post-training. Explain how this term is formulated and how it impacts the training process and final shared weights.  

5. The paper evaluates the methods on a range of datasets spanning reasoning, language understanding, knowledge and examination tasks. Can you summarize the key results and how performance differed across these different categories of tasks?

6. The paper states that DirectShare performs competitively with a state-of-the-art pruning method without requiring retraining. What specifically does this demonstrate about the feasibility of the proposed fine-grained sharing technique?

7. The results show PostShare can help recover performance on certain tasks where DirectShare struggled. But the paper also notes a risk of overfitting during post-training. Can you expand on this issue and discuss potential ways to mitigate overfitting?

8. The paper combines weight sharing with 4-bit quantization and shows little additional impact on performance. Explain why weight sharing and quantization can be effectively combined and discuss the potential memory savings.  

9. The paper explores applying the method to both large and small scale language models. Summarize what the robustness experiments revealed about the viability of head-wise weight sharing across model sizes. 

10. The visualization study gives insight into the distribution of shared weights across layers and heads. What key observations were made and how do they relate to the feasibility of fine-grained vs coarse-grained sharing strategies?
