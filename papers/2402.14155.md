# [Can Similarity-Based Domain-Ordering Reduce Catastrophic Forgetting for   Intent Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dialogue systems need to handle new domains after deployment, but retraining models from scratch is expensive. Continual learning (CL) allows models to adapt without full retraining.
- However, CL models suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) - deterioration in performance on older domains when trained on new ones.
- Prior CL research has explored techniques like replay and regularization, but the effect of domain ordering remains unexplored for intent recognition in dialog systems.

Methodology:
- Use T5-Base and T5-Large for intent recognition on Schema-Guided Dialog dataset's 20 domains.  
- Generate domain orderings using inter-domain similarity graphs and 3 strategies: min-sum path, max-sum path, random.
- Continually fine-tune models on subsets of 5 domains based on these orderings.
- Evaluate using Average Accuracy and Average Catastrophic Forgetting.

Key Findings:
- For T5-Base, min-sum path ordering significantly reduces CF compared to other strategies. It progresses from similar to dissimilar domains, aiding generalization.
- For T5-Large, ordering has no significant impact on CF. Model size matters more.

Main Contributions:
- First study analyzing effect of domain order on CF in continual learning for dialog intent recognition.
- Identify min-sum path ordering as best strategy to mitigate CF with smaller model size. 
- Show ordering effect diminishes with larger model, indicating its usefulness in low-resource scenarios.
- Provide new insights on curriculum learning for continual intent recognition.

In summary, the paper demonstrates domain ordering can complement existing CL techniques for intent recognition, especially when compute resources are limited. The min-sum path strategy produces the best outcomes.
