# [Modelisation of a rolling disk with Sympy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16624)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a Lagrangian modeling approach using symbolic computation in Python to derive the state equations describing the motion of a disk rolling on a plane without sliding or friction. The state variables include the center position coordinates, three Euler orientation angles, and their time derivatives. The Lagrangian accounts for kinetic and potential energy. Constraints from ground reaction forces not allowing sliding or slipping are incorporated using d'Alembert's principle and Lagrange multipliers. This yields a system of differential-algebraic equations that is symbolically solved to obtain compact state equations. These are validated through simulations showing expected circular trajectory with precession, as well as simpler motions. The symbolic computation streamlines the tedious derivations, allows general parameterization, and enables compact closed-form system equations. Overall, this showcases an efficient physics-based modeling approach for this classical non-holonomic mechanics problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper uses a Lagrangian approach and symbolic computation with Sympy to derive the state equations modeling the dynamics of a disk rolling on a plane without sliding or friction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is using symbolic computation with the SymPy package in Python to derive the state equations for a disk rolling on a plane without sliding, using a Lagrangian approach. Specifically:

- The paper represents the kinematics of the rolling disk system using Euler angles and establishes the Lagrangian by computing the kinetic and potential energy. 

- It then applies the Euler-Lagrange equation with non-holonomic constraints to obtain the state equations, taking advantage of SymPy symbolic math capabilities to simplify the derivations. 

- The paper provides the full Python code to generate the system equations and simulate the dynamics of the rolling disk. 

- It discusses and simulates some special cases of the disk motion to validate the derived state equations against intuition.

In summary, the key contribution is leveraging symbolic computation to streamline the modeling process for this classical mechanics problem, and providing an executable environment to apply and test the theoretical results.

The paper focuses on using a Lagrangian approach along with symbolic computation in Sympy to derive the state equations for a rolling disk. Key concepts include defining the orientation with Euler angles, formulating the kinetic and potential energy, incorporating nonholonomic constraints from rolling contact using d'Alembert's principle, and solving the equations to end up with state equations describing the disk's motion. The solution method relies heavily on matrix calculus and linear algebra. In the end some simulations are shown to validate the model, including the precession effect.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes the Lagrangian approach to model the dynamics of a rolling disk. What are the key advantages of using a Lagrangian formulation over other modeling approaches like Newtonian mechanics?

2. The orientation matrix R relating the body frame to the inertial frame plays an important role. Explain how the time derivative of R leads to an expression for the angular velocity vector ωr. What insights does this provide?  

3. Explain the physical significance of the nonholonomic constraints equations derived in the paper. How do they mathematically represent the no-slide condition?

4. What is D'Alembert's principle and how is it applied in the paper to find expressions for the constraint forces τ? Discuss the meaning of virtual displacements in this context.  

5. The mass matrix M(q) appears in the final equations of motion. What are its key properties? Discuss difficulties that can arise when numerically integrating equations with an explicit mass matrix.

6. Discuss the structure and physical meaning of the final state space equations for the rolling disk. How many states are there and what does each one represent? 

7. Explain the difference between holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. Provide an example of each type of constraint. 

8. The paper shows three case studies after deriving the equations of motion. Pick one case and explain what physical insights it provides into the model. How does it help validate the theoretical development?

9. Discuss potential limitations or singularities of the derived model. When might it break down or no longer apply?

10. The model assumes no slip and frictionless rolling. Speculate on changes if viscous friction or longitudinal/lateral slip were introduced. What additional modeling considerations would be required?
