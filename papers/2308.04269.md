# [Lossy and Lossless (L$^2$) Post-training Model Size Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04269)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we achieve high compression ratios for deep neural network models efficiently through an integrated application of lossy and lossless compression techniques in a unified post-training compression framework?

Some key points:

- The paper proposes a novel post-training model compression approach that combines lossy and lossless compression in an integrated manner. 

- It aims to efficiently achieve high compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss through jointly optimizing various lossy compression techniques like pruning and quantization.

- A key hypothesis seems to be that optimizing lossy compression to produce weights more amenable for entropy encoding, will allow better leveraging of lossless techniques to boost compression. 

- The paper introduces techniques like a unified parametric weight transformation and a differentiable counter that enable joint optimization of diverse lossy techniques while considering properties needed for good lossless compression.

- The goal is to achieve superior compression ratios compared to using lossy and lossless techniques in isolation or sequence, within the efficient post-training compression setting.

So in summary, the central research question is how to efficiently and unifiably combine lossy and lossless compression to push compression ratios for deep models in a post-training manner. The key hypothesis is that optimizing them jointly will yield better compression than separate/sequential application.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a post-training model compression method that combines lossy and lossless compression techniques in a unified framework. Specifically:

- They introduce a unified parametric weight transformation approach to integrate different lossy compression techniques like pruning and quantization. This allows jointly optimizing them in a post-training manner.

- They propose a differentiable counter using a kernel function to estimate the entropy of the compressed weights. This helps optimize the lossy compression step to produce weights more amenable to the later lossless compression. 

- Their method allows controlling the target overall compression ratio while adaptively allocating ratios for each layer.

- Experiments show their method can achieve high compression ratios (e.g. 10x) with negligible accuracy loss, and even higher ratios (e.g. 20x) with minor losses. 

In summary, the key contribution seems to be presenting a unified modeling approach to combine lossy and lossless compression in an efficient post-training optimization framework, while considering their interactions to maximize compression. The proposed techniques like the unified weight transformation and differentiable counter enable optimizing the compression in this integrated manner.
