# [Generating Feasible and Plausible Counterfactual Explanations for   Outcome Prediction of Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09232)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Predictive models used in predictive process analytics (PPA) lack transparency and interpretability. This makes it difficult for users to understand the reasoning behind predictions, especially undesirable ones.  
- Counterfactual explanations can provide clarity by showing "what if" scenarios indicating what changes could lead to a different, more desired prediction. However, generating valid counterfactuals for sequential process data is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces REVISED+, a method to generate feasible and plausible counterfactual explanations tailored to process data. 
- It restricts counterfactuals to lie in high-density regions of the process data distribution. This promotes feasibility.
- It incorporates Declare constraints, which describe temporal activity patterns, into the loss function. This promotes plausibility.
- Specifically, trace constraints are added to the VAE and label-specific constraints to the counterfactual generation.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies properties that define valid counterfactuals for PPA: proximity, sparsity, plausibility, feasibility and diversity.
- Proposes metrics to evaluate these properties for sequential process data.
- Introduces REVISED+ algorithm to generate counterfactuals optimized for plausibility and feasibility.
- Empirically demonstrates that adding constraints increases quantity and validity of counterfactuals over 9 event logs.
- Provides real example showcasing usefulness for reasoning about factors influencing predictions.

In summary, the paper presents a novel method for generating high-quality counterfactual explanations for predictive process analytics. By optimizing for plausibility and feasibility, it generates realistic "what-if" scenarios to aid in the interpretation of model predictions over sequential process executions.
