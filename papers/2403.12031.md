# [ROUTERBENCH: A Benchmark for Multi-LLM Routing System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12031)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive capabilities across many tasks, but using only a single LLM has limitations in terms of cost, performance tradeoffs, and inability to leverage strengths of multiple models.  

- LLM routing systems aim to address these issues by combining multiple LLMs and routing inputs to the optimal LLM based on user constraints like cost and performance. However, there has been no standardized benchmark to evaluate routing systems.

Proposed Solution 
- The paper introduces RouterBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite to assess LLM routing systems. It contains 405K samples covering major LLM tasks like reasoning, math, coding etc. and outputs from 11 LLMs including GPT-3.

- They propose a theoretical framework to evaluate routers using metrics like cost-quality tradeoffs and average quality improvement. This allows standardized comparison of different routing algorithms.

- They implement and test several predictive (MLP, KNN-based) and non-predictive (cascading) routers using the benchmark. The oracle router gives upper bound on potential routing gains.

Key Contributions
- RouterBench benchmark with rich task coverage and LLM outputs to evaluate routers without expensive inference

- Formalized metrics and mathematical framework to compare different routing systems 

- Analysis of several routing algorithms, revealing 2-5x cost benefits possible over individual LLMs

- Demonstrating feasibility and potential of LLM routing, RouterBench aims to drive further progress in this area to make LLMs more accessible.
