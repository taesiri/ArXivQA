# [Riveter: Measuring Power and Social Dynamics Between Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Verb-centric lexica that capture social dynamics between entities in text (e.g. power, sentiment) are useful for studying phenomena like gender bias across corpora. However, working with these lexica poses challenges for non-NLP researchers due to the need for core NLP skills like parsing and named entity recognition, interfacing between different NLP tools, and interpreting the lexicon results. This reduces accessibility of the lexica for digital humanities/social science researchers.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces Riveter, a Python package that provides a complete pipeline for using verb-centric lexica to analyze social dynamics between entities in text. Riveter handles the NLP processing like parsing, coreference resolution and named entity recognition under the hood using performant libraries like spaCy. It has functionality to load lexica, extract lexical scores per entity, and explore/visualize results. This makes verb lexica more accessible for non-NLP experts.

Main Contributions:
- Lowers barrier for using verb-centric lexica by handling complex NLP behind the scenes 
- Provides intuitive functions for loading lexica, extracting social scores per entity, aggregating and visualizing
- Showcases Riveter's usefulness through case studies of analyzing power dynamics in AI-generated stories and gender roles in the novel Pride and Prejudice
- Open-sources Riveter to make verb lexica analysis more accessible for digital humanities/social science researchers

In summary, the paper introduces an easy-to-use software package called Riveter that makes verb-centric lexica for analyzing social dynamics computationally accessible to a broader range of researchers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Riveter, a Python package that provides an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing power dynamics and social biases in text using verb-based lexicons, aimed at improving accessibility and interpretability for researchers across the humanities and social sciences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution of this work is the introduction of Riveter, a Python package that provides tools to use, evaluate, and visualize verb lexica. Specifically, Riveter:

- Includes a pipeline system for importing a lexicon, parsing a dataset, identifying entities, resolving coreferences, and measuring patterns across those entities. 

- Provides functionality to explore the outputs of each component of the pipeline.

- Includes evaluation and visualization methods to promote grounded analyses within a targeted dataset. 

The paper argues that while verb-based lexica are useful for studying social phenomena in text, working with them poses technical hurdles involving NLP pipelines and result interpretation. By packaging the necessary NLP components and providing integrated evaluation methods, Riveter aims to make verb lexica more accessible to researchers across the social sciences and humanities.

So in summary, the main contribution is the Riveter Python package itself, which connects NLP pipelines and provides accessible methods for working with verb lexica to study social dynamics in text.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Connotation frames - verb-centric lexica that capture implied sentiment, power, and agency relations between the subject (agent) and object (theme) of a verb

- Verb predicates - the main verbs in a sentence that describe events and states

- Sentiment analysis - analyzing the sentiment/emotion conveyed in text

- Power dynamics - modeling the power differential between two entities in text

- Agency - capturing how much decisiveness and ability to act an entity has

- Pipeline system - the end-to-end system in Riveter for parsing text, extracting triples, resolving coreference, scoring lexicon matches 

- Interpretability - ability for users to understand and validate the textual patterns measured by Riveter

- Social dynamics - broader social attitudes, biases, and hierarchies encoded in language

- Digital humanities - interdisciplinary field combining computing and humanities disciplines

- Cultural analytics - using computational methods to study culture via cultural artifacts like text

So in summary, the key concepts cover the verb lexicons, sentiment/power/agency dimensions, the computational pipeline, interpretability, and applications in fields like digital humanities and cultural analytics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions addressing three main challenges with using verb lexicons - familiarity with NLP tools, interfacing between tools, and interpreting results. Can you expand on the specific ways that Riveter handles each of these challenges? What design decisions were made?

2. The pipeline diagram in Figure 2 shows the overall flow through Riveter. Can you walk through this pipeline step-by-step and explain the purpose and output of each component? What are some key functions of the exploration and visualization components?  

3. In the lexicon loading section, the authors describe converting the categorical labels from Sap et al.'s lexicon into numerical scores. What is the purpose of this conversion and what are some of the advantages? How does it facilitate aggregation over entities?

4. One of the stated goals is to facilitate analysis established in prior work. Can you discuss 2-3 specific types of analyses that Riveter aims to facilitate, possibly referencing relevant papers from Table 1? What functionality supports these types of analyses?

5. In the first case study, predetermined power roles are given to GPT-3.5 to generate stories. What was the purpose of this study and what results did it show about Riveter's capabilities? How do the graphs in Figures 3 and 4 support the conclusions?

6. In the second case study on Pride and Prejudice, what specific capabilities of Riveter were showcased? How did the customization of pronoun groups and visualization methods provide insight into gender hierarchies and power dynamics in the novel?

7. The authors state that Riveter can serve multiple roles, such as diagnostic, formalizer, and synecdoche. Can you explain what each of these roles means and how Riveter fits that role? Provide examples.  

8. What are some limitations of Riveter discussed from an ethics perspective? For example, how might biases be propagated through the tool? How does the interpretability aim to mitigate risks?

9. The functionality seems focused on English text. How might Riveter handle or be extended to other languages? Would all components transfer directly? What challenges might exist?

10. If you were to propose additional capabilities for Riveter, what might those be? For example, what other visualization methods could facilitate new analyses aligned with the goals of the tool? Or what other models could it potentially incorporate?
