# [Personalized Audiobook Recommendations at Spotify Through Graph Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Audiobook recommendations is a new and challenging task, especially on an existing platform like Spotify with music and podcasts. Main issues are extreme cold-start due to user unfamiliarity, high stakes due to paid model initially, and needs to fit into existing Spotify architecture.  

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a modular Two-Tower Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (2T-HGNN) that combines strengths of GNNs to capture nuanced item relationships and Two Tower (2T) models for scalability.

- Construct a co-listening graph between items (audiobooks & podcasts) based on user interactions. Add content features from language model. Use 2-layer HGNN on graph to get item embeddings.

- 2T model then takes HGNN embeddings as well as user features to generate user and item vectors for recommendation. Weak signals also incorporated to deal with cold-start.

Main Contributions:
- First work to investigate audiobook recommendations at scale and show connection between user tastes in podcasts and audiobooks

- Novel model architecture with HGNN on item graph combined with 2T model, enhancing both accuracy and scalability

- Introduction of balanced neighbor sampler in HGNN to handle imbalance between different edge types

- Strong offline experimental results beating baselines. A/B test with millions of users resulted in significant lifts - 25.8% increase in streaming rate and 46.8% increase in new audiobook starts.

- Model launched into production, benefiting both audiobook and podcast recommendations.
