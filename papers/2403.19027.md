# [Should I Help a Delivery Robot? Cultivating Prosocial Norms through   Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19027)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Delivery robots are increasingly deployed in public spaces, necessitating thoughtful integration with human society. However, lack of transparency and public acceptance hinders their adoption.  
- Fostering harmonious human-robot interactions and prosocial behaviors is crucial but the reliability of existing methods remains questionable.

Proposed Solution:  
- Leverage social observation and conformity to established new prosocial norms between humans and robots.
- Conduct an online randomized controlled experiment to quantitatively evaluate changes in normative beliefs regarding human-robot prosocial behaviors through observational learning.

Methods:
- 210 participants assigned to one of three observation conditions: human-helping-human, human-helping-robot, robot-helping-human.
- Measured normative beliefs at baseline, after observation trials, and during decision trials where participants assume the helper role.
- High visual-fidelity simulation environment with three mobility-related prosocial scenarios.

Key Findings:
- Observing robots helping humans (vs being helped) more effectively increased feelings of obligation to help robots. Highlights the role of reciprocal expectations.
- Positive changes in beliefs about robots helping humans increased participants' intention to help robots. Suggests internalization of learned norm.  
- Familiarity with robot capabilities and portraying them as social partners can promote acceptance.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates feasibility of using observational learning to establish prosocial norms in human-robot interactions
- Compares relative effectiveness of different observation scenarios 
- Identifies key factors shaping baseline normative beliefs about assisting robots
- Provides design insights to encourage human prosociality towards mobility robots

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being addressed, the proposed observational learning solution, the experimental methods/design, major results related to the research questions, and the main contributions of this work. It highlights how observing robots helping humans can promote reciprocal expectations and acceptance of mobility robots in public spaces.
