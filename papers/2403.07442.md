# [Proxy Methods for Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07442)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of domain adaptation under distribution shift caused by changes in the distribution of an unobserved latent variable that confounds both the covariates and labels. Neither covariate shift nor label shift assumptions hold in this setting. The goal is to identify the optimal predictor in the target domain without having access to any labels.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes to use "proxy" variables that provide indirect information about the latent variable, along with either (i) "concept" variables that mediate the relationship between covariates and labels or (ii) data from multiple source domains with different distributions over the latent variable. 

The key idea is to construct "bridge" functions that connect the proxies to the labels, marginalizing over the latent variable. This allows identification of the optimal predictor without needing to explicitly model the latent variable distribution.

Two estimation procedures are proposed:
1) Two-stage kernel regression using proxies, concepts and covariates 
2) Two-stage kernel regression using proxies, covariates and data from multiple source domains

Main Contributions:

- Shows that bridge functions can be adapted from source to target leading to identification of optimal predictor under arbitrary latent shifts, without needing to identify latent variable distribution.  

- Considers two settings: (i) concepts available (ii) multiple source domains available. In each case, shows conditions under which adaptation is possible.

- Develops practical two-stage kernel estimation methods for adaptation in both settings.

- Empirically demonstrates robustness to complex latent shifts on simulated and real datasets. The method outperforms baselines including methods that explicitly model the latent variable distribution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes techniques to adapt predictive models across domains when the distribution shift is due to changes in an unobserved variable that confounds the relationship between covariates and outcomes, using either proxy variables or data from multiple source domains to enable adaptation without explicitly modeling the latent variable.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing techniques for domain adaptation under the latent shift assumption that are guaranteed to identify the optimal predictor in the target domain without explicitly recovering or modeling latent variables. Specifically:

1) They propose using proxy methods from proximal causal inference to perform adaptation without needing to identify the distribution of the latent variable. This allows them to adapt to arbitrary latent shifts.

2) They consider two settings: (i) the Concept Bottleneck setting where an additional "concept" variable mediating the relationship between covariates and labels is observed, and (ii) the Multi-Domain setting where training data from multiple source domains with different latent variable distributions is available. 

3) For both settings, they provide guarantees for identifying the optimal predictor in the target domain and develop practical two-stage kernel estimators to perform the adaptation.

4) In experiments, they show their approach outperforms other methods, including those that explicitly estimate the latent variable distribution, demonstrating robustness to complex latent shifts.

In summary, the main contribution is a new approach to domain adaptation under latent shift that does not require explicitly modeling the latent variable, instead relying on proxy variables and multiple domains. This provides theoretical guarantees and practical methods for adapting to complex shifts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Domain adaptation - Transferring a model trained on a source domain to a target domain with a different data distribution.

- Latent shift - The distribution change between domains is due to a change in the distribution of an unobserved latent variable that confounds the covariates and labels.

- Concept bottleneck - An additional "concept" variable is observed that mediates the relationship between the covariates and labels. 

- Multi-domain - Training data from multiple source domains with different distributions over the latent confounder is available.

- Proxy methods - Using observed proxy variables for unobserved confounders to estimate causal effects. 

- Bridge functions - Functions that connect proxy variables to labels and allow identification of distributions involving unobserved confounders.

- Kernel estimation - Nonparametric estimation of bridge functions and subsequent prediction on target domain using kernels.

So in summary, key concepts are domain adaptation under latent shift, use of proxies and concepts for adaptation, multi-domain adaptation, bridge functions for adaptation without latent variable recovery, and kernel estimation methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes adapting to distribution shifts in unlabeled data by using proxy variables and either concept variables or multiple source domains. What is the intuition behind why these additional variables enable adaptation? How does this connect to ideas from causality?

2. Theorem 1 shows that the optimal predictor $\mathbb{E}_q[Y|x]$ is identifiable given concepts $C$ and proxies $W$. Walk through the key steps of the proof. What assumptions are required? How do the proxies and concepts enable identification without needing to identify the distribution over the latent variable $U$?

3. In Section 3.2, the paper discusses identification using multiple source domains instead of concept variables. Explain the result shown in Proposition 1 about when full identification is possible. Why does having multiple domains help enable adaptation even without concepts? What limitations exist when $U$ is continuous?

4. Walk through the two-stage kernel estimation procedure proposed in Section 4 for estimating the bridge function $h_0$. Why is a two-stage procedure used here rather than jointly estimating everything together? What is the motivation for using conditional mean embeddings? 

5. The estimation procedure requires selecting several hyperparameters, such as the kernel hyperparameters and regularization parameters λ1, λ2. How should these parameters be selected? What considerations need to be made during selection to ensure proper adaptation performance?

6. For the multi-domain setting, the paper assumes access to samples from the marginal distribution $P(X,W)$ in the target domain. Why is this assumption needed? What changes if only samples from $P(X)$ are available at test time instead?

7. In the experiment in Section 5.3 with the MIMIC-CXR dataset, the multi-domain adaptation procedure was not very successful but the concept adaptation approach worked well. Provide some hypotheses for why this occurred. When should we expect concept variables to be necessary?

8. The method requires strict assumptions on the causal graph, such as faithfulness and completeness. When are these assumptions likely to be violated in practice? How would violation impact the theoretical guarantees for adaptation?

9. The paper focuses on adapting classifiers and regressors. Could the proposed technique also be applied to adapting more complex models like deep neural networks? What modifications would need to be made?

10. A limitation of the method is the need for proxies and concepts/multiple domains. In what practical settings might such variables naturally arise? When would proxies or concepts be unavailable, making the technique inapplicable?
