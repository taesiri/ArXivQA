## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate air quality forecasting is critical for public health and environmental protection. However, existing methods fail to effectively utilize information across different spatial and temporal scales. Spatially, they lack flexibility in interactions between individual stations and the overall city. Temporally, they overlook the periodic nature of air quality variations across timescales.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel Multi-spatial Multi-temporal air quality forecasting method based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Gated Recurrent Units (M2G2). M2G2 bridges the gap in utilizing multi-scale information spatially and temporally. It has two key components:

1) Multi-scale Spatial GCN (MS-GCN): Employing graph structures at both station and city scales, it captures spatial features. A bidirectional learnable fusion enables information interaction between scales. 

2) Multi-scale Temporal GRU (MT-GRU): Using parallel hidden states with distinct update frequencies, it aggregates information across temporal scales. Dynamic weights are assigned to combine features from different periodicities.

Main Contributions:
- First air quality forecasting method considering dual multi-scale in both spatial and temporal dimensions
- Constructs M2G2 with MS-GCN for spatial and MT-GRU for temporal multi-scale feature learning
- MS-GCN has a bidirectional learnable structure for station and city scale interaction  
- MT-GRU uses multiple hidden states to capture multi-periodic temporal patterns
- Experiments on real-world data of 4 pollutants over 5 years, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art across metrics
- Ablation studies validate the efficacy of each M2G2 module in capturing multi-scale dependencies

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in advancing air quality forecasting by effectively modeling complex multi-scale spatiotemporal relationships using graph neural networks and gated recurrent units.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing M2G2, a novel air quality forecasting method that considers multi-scale features in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes a multi-scale spatial module (MS-GCN) based on graph convolutional networks that models spatial relationships at both the station level and city level, and allows for interaction and fusion of features between these two scales. 

2) The paper proposes a multi-scale temporal module (MT-GRU) based on gated recurrent units that incorporates multiple parallel hidden states with different update frequencies to capture temporal features at varying time scales.

3) The paper collects and utilizes a comprehensive real-world dataset with four air quality indicators and meteorological data across 152 stations in 41 cities over a five-year period. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2G2 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for air quality forecasting across different metrics and time horizons.

4) Ablation studies validate the efficacy of each module in M2G2. Additional experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of M2G2 for predicting multiple air pollutants beyond just PM2.5.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the M2G2 model for effectively forecasting air quality by considering multi-scale spatial and temporal features. The introduced techniques and experimental results advance the state-of-the-art in this domain.
