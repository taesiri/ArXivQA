# [Single Transit Detection In Kepler With Machine Learning And Onboard   Spacecraft Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03427)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Exoplanet detection techniques like phase-folding of light curves are biased towards shorter orbital period planets, leaving a gap in discoveries at longer orbital periods. This limits constraints on occurrence rates of planets like Earth. 
- Single transit detection is needed to find longer period planets, but is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble pipeline to identify single transits in Kepler light curves. 
- Incorporate Kepler's ancillary spacecraft engineering data, which has not been used before, as additional input to the CNNs.
- Train CNN ensemble on 621 long-period, small planets from Kepler.

Pipeline:
- Apply data preprocessing and use sliding window to create input light curve segments.
- Classify each segment with the CNN ensemble and identify timestamps likely containing transits.
- Use peak finding and periodograms to locate individual transits and measure the orbital period.

Contributions:
- Show spacecraft engineering data improves transit classification accuracy to 81% (from 77% with photometry alone). 
- Achieve high recovery rate for injected transits down to ~3 Earth radii on test star.
- Discover new single transit candidate KOI 1271.02 in known KOI 1271 system.
- Constrain KOI 1271.02 parameters (period, radius, mass) via transit and TTV modeling. Favored 7:2 resonance solution makes it a 5.3 Earth radius super-Earth.

Overall, the paper demonstrates this CNN ensemble approach using spacecraft data can push Kepler to higher sensitivity for longer-period small planets. This will help improve constraints on planet occurrence rates. The discovery of KOI 1271.02 highlights the potential to still find new planets in Kepler data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper develops a pipeline using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks incorporating Kepler spacecraft engineering data to detect single exoplanet transits, reports the discovery of a new exoplanet candidate in the KOI 1271 system, and constrains the orbital parameters of the candidate.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel pipeline using machine learning to detect single transit events in Kepler data. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that incorporating Kepler's ancillary engineering data (spacecraft diagnostics) as inputs to a neural network ensemble can improve the accuracy of detecting transits compared to using just the flux data. 

2) The paper presents an end-to-end pipeline using this neural network ensemble to take a Kepler lightcurve with no prior planetary information and locate individual transits and determine the orbital period. This pipeline is demonstrated to be sensitive to planets down to about 3.5 Earth radii on orbits up to 800 days.

3) The pipeline discovers a new single transit planet candidate (KOI 1271.02) in the KOI 1271 system. Further modeling places constraints on the parameters of this candidate planet.

In summary, the key innovation is the machine learning pipeline to push Kepler's sensitivity to smaller, longer-period planets using both flux and spacecraft engineering data, as demonstrated through the discovery of the new candidate KOI 1271.02. This has the potential to detect additional low signal-to-noise transiting planets in the Kepler dataset.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

The paper focuses on developing a machine learning pipeline to detect single transit events in the Kepler dataset, particularly for longer orbital period planets, in order to help constrain exoplanet occurrence rates. Key elements include using an ensemble of CNNs trained on both flux and spacecraft engineering data, applying the pipeline to identify a candidate planet in the KOI 1271 system, and performing injections to test the detection sensitivity. Concepts like TTVs, mean motion resonances, η-Earth, and occurrence rates are also important for interpreting and situating the results.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) What was the motivation behind using the ancillary engineering data from Kepler in addition to the photometric data? How did the engineering data help improve transit detection?

2) The paper mentions using an ensemble of CNNs instead of a single NN. Why was this ensemble approach more effective? How did using uniquely structured CNNs in the ensemble help improve performance? 

3) The paper describes a detailed pipeline to go from a raw Kepler lightcurve to predicting the locations and period of transits with no prior stellar or planet information. Can you walk through the key steps in this pipeline and the purpose of each?

4) What resonances were explored when trying to model the TTVs of KOI 1271.01 and constrain the parameters of KOI 1271.02? Why were only certain resonance configurations considered plausible?

5) The paper performs feature mapping to obtain a more precise transit location. Explain how this process works. Why was feature mapping not used when determining the period?

6) Several figures show example solutions for recreating the observed TTVs of KOI 1271.01 under different resonances between 1271.01 and 1271.02. Compare and contrast the fits under different resonances. Which resonance configuration was favored and why?

7) Discuss the constraints, or lack thereof, on the periods of KOI 1271.01 and 1271.02 based on existing Kepler data. Why are additional transits needed to refine the orbital models? 

8) Explain the injection and recovery testing performed. How was sensitivity assessed and what were the key results? Were there any biases in defining recovery criteria?

9) The radius, mass and atmospheric composition of KOI 1271.02 are estimated and discussed. Compare 1271.02 to known exoplanets in a mass/radius diagram. Is it consistent with theoretical models?

10) The paper attempted TESS follow-up of the KOI 1271 system. Summarize the objective, results, and limitations of this analysis. What further follow-up might refine the 1271.01/1271.02 models?
