# [Single Transit Detection In Kepler With Machine Learning And Onboard   Spacecraft Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03427)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Exoplanet detection techniques like phase-folding of light curves are biased towards shorter orbital period planets, leaving a gap in discoveries at longer orbital periods. This limits constraints on occurrence rates of planets like Earth. 
- Single transit detection is needed to find longer period planets, but is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble pipeline to identify single transits in Kepler light curves. 
- Incorporate Kepler's ancillary spacecraft engineering data, which has not been used before, as additional input to the CNNs.
- Train CNN ensemble on 621 long-period, small planets from Kepler.

Pipeline:
- Apply data preprocessing and use sliding window to create input light curve segments.
- Classify each segment with the CNN ensemble and identify timestamps likely containing transits.
- Use peak finding and periodograms to locate individual transits and measure the orbital period.

Contributions:
- Show spacecraft engineering data improves transit classification accuracy to 81% (from 77% with photometry alone). 
- Achieve high recovery rate for injected transits down to ~3 Earth radii on test star.
- Discover new single transit candidate KOI 1271.02 in known KOI 1271 system.
- Constrain KOI 1271.02 parameters (period, radius, mass) via transit and TTV modeling. Favored 7:2 resonance solution makes it a 5.3 Earth radius super-Earth.

Overall, the paper demonstrates this CNN ensemble approach using spacecraft data can push Kepler to higher sensitivity for longer-period small planets. This will help improve constraints on planet occurrence rates. The discovery of KOI 1271.02 highlights the potential to still find new planets in Kepler data.
