# [Deformable One-shot Face Stylization via DINO Semantic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of one-shot face stylization, which aims to stylize a facial image into an artistic style defined by a single example. Existing methods have focused on appearance transfer but overlooked structural exaggerations that are key characteristics of artistic styles. Simply relying on the inversion of the style example is insufficient to provide reliable deformation guidance.  

Solution:
The paper proposes a deformation-aware face stylization framework that can generate diverse, high-quality stylized faces with desired deformations from only a single real-style image pair. The key idea is to leverage the robust and consistent facial structure representation from DINO, a self-supervised vision transformer, to guide the cross-domain deformation learning.  

Specifically, the framework fine-tunes a StyleGAN generator appended with spatial transformer networks to make it deformation-aware. Two innovative DINO-based losses are introduced - a directional deformation loss that aligns the structural changing directions and a relative consistency loss that preserves diversity. Additional color alignment via style mixing further enhances stability.

Main Contributions:
- Explores DINO features and discovers its powerful capability in capturing consistent semantics across real and artistic facial domains, superior to other vision transformers
- Proposes two novel losses based on DINO guidance to constrain the cross-domain geometric deformation 
- Develops a deformation-aware generator trained with only a single real-style image pair that can generate diverse, high-quality stylized faces with desired exaggerations
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, with fine-tuning taking only 10 minutes
