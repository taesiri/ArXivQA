# [DREditor: An Time-efficient Approach for Building a Domain-specific   Dense Retrieval Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12540)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cloud customer service platforms need to quickly deploy domain-specific dense retrieval models to power search across enterprises. However, training these models is very time-consuming due to iterative gradient-based optimization.  
- This is especially challenging for small/medium providers with limited compute resources. Current methods like adapter tuning are still too slow, taking days on GPUs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes DREditor, a highly efficient post-processing method to adapt a dense retriever to new domains. 
- It directly edits the embedding space by learning a specialized linear transformation, without any model finetuning.
- Given a domain dataset, it solves a least squares problem to find an "edit operator" matrix that pulls embeddings of questions towards their answers.

Key Contributions:
- DREditor achieves up to 300x speedup over adapter tuning in domain adaptation, with no loss in retrieval quality.
- It works for any dense retriever, transforms both query/corpus embeddings.
- Demonstrated on multiple domains (finance, science, biomedicine), models (SBERT, DPR, ANCE) and devices (GPU/CPU).  
- Also adapts successfully to zero-shot domain transfer using external knowledge.
- Sets a precedent for extremely fast editing methods as alternate to slow finetuning.

In summary, DREditor enables rapid deployment of domain-customized dense retrieval, which is crucial for cloud customer service platforms. The efficiency gains open up ability to customize for many domains and clients.

The paper proposes an efficient method called DREditor to calibrate the embeddings of a dense retrieval model to adapt it to a specific domain. Key aspects include formulating an optimization objective to edit the matching rule by minimizing the error between questions and answers, while keeping the answer embeddings invariant. This allows efficient adaptation without iterative gradient-based fine-tuning. Experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on domain-specific and zero-shot retrieval scenarios across different models, datasets and devices. Overall, the key focus is on rapidly customizing dense retrievers to new domains in a time-efficient manner for applications like enterprise search services.
