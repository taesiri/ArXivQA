# [CLongEval: A Chinese Benchmark for Evaluating Long-Context Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03514)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) with long-context abilities in Chinese. 
- Existing benchmarks have limitations such as insufficient data volume, narrow applicability in terms of context lengths, or inadequate quality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents CLongEval, a new Chinese benchmark for evaluating LLMs' long-context capabilities. 
- CLongEval contains 7 distinct tasks with over 7,000 test examples. The tasks are designed to assess key capabilities like information acquisition and reasoning.
- The benchmark stratifies test data into small, medium and large subsets based on context lengths, ranging from 1K to 100K tokens. This ensures broad applicability.  
- Two tasks have over 2,000 manually annotated QA pairs and one task uses GPT-4 annotations, ensuring high quality. The other four tasks reuse existing public datasets.

Main Contributions:
- CLongEval is the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark focused specifically on evaluating LLMs in long-context settings.
- With sufficient data volume, varying context lengths, and high-quality annotations, CLongEval enables thorough assessment of existing Chinese LLMs.
- Using CLongEval, the paper benchmarks 8 long-context Chinese LLMs and provides analysis into their capabilities and limitations in handling long context.

In summary, CLongEval moves towards standardized evaluation of long-context abilities for Chinese LLMs by providing a high-quality benchmark encapsulating diverse and practical test scenarios. The analysis based on the benchmark sheds light into current progress and challenges in this domain.
