# [A Motion Planning Algorithm in a Figure Eight Track](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the motion planning problem for two robots moving along a figure eight track without collisions. The goal is to design an algorithm that can take in initial and final configurations of the robots and output a continuous collision-free path between them. Planning optimal, stable algorithms is challenging due to topological features of configuration spaces.

Proposed Solution:
The authors use a topological approach to motion planning. They construct the configuration space of the robots and show it deforms to a spine which is a wedge sum of 7 circles. Using topological complexity, calculated as 3 for this space, they design an explicit algorithm with 3 continuous instructions operating on the spine. The instructions are then extended to the full configuration space using the deformation, and finally translated to robot movements in the physical space.

Key Contributions:
- Construct the configuration space of 2 robots on a figure eight track and give an intuitive visualization using tori.
- Show the configuration space deformation retracts to a 1D spine using explicit homotopy traces. 
- Prove the spine is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 7 circles.
- Use topological complexity to formally calculate the minimal number of instructions needed is 3.
- Give detailed algorithms with 3 instructions on the spine, configuration space and physical robot positions.
- Demonstrate examples of robot movements generated by the algorithm in physical and configuration spaces.

The paper provides an elegant topology-based technique to create provably optimal motion planning algorithms for robots by carefully analyzing configuration spaces. The algorithms enable collision-free navigation of two robots on the figure eight track.
