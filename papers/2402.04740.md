# [Non-Parametric Estimation of Multi-dimensional Marked Hawkes Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the problem of non-parametrically estimating the multidimensional marked Hawkes process. The marked Hawkes process is an extension of the Hawkes process that incorporates variable "marks" or characteristics associated with each event, unlike the Hawkes process where events have a constant impact. Estimating this process is challenging, especially in a non-parametric manner that preserves interpretability. Most existing methods make simplifying assumptions or rely on recurrent neural networks.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two neural network-based approaches for estimating marked Hawkes processes:

1) Shallow Neural Hawkes (SNH) with Marks: Tailored for linear marked Hawkes processes with only excitatory kernels. Uses a 2-layer feedforward network to represent the Hawkes kernel as a joint function of time and marks.

2) Neural Network for Non-Linear Hawkes (NNNH) with Marks: Handles non-linear marked Hawkes processes with both excitatory and inhibitory kernels. Uses a ReLU activation function to keep the intensity positive.

Both methods use stochastic gradient descent on the log-likelihood function for estimation. The models can capture interdependent effects of past event times and associated marks on intensity.

Main Contributions:

- First known non-parametric approach to estimate the marked Hawkes kernel as a combined function of time and marks
- Two flexible neural network methodologies proposed: SNH and NNNH adapted for marks 
- Evaluation on synthetic and real cryptocurrency data demonstrates ability to uncover dependencies neglected by other methods
- Kernels estimated from data provide interpretable insights into temporal and mark dependencies
- Approach is suited for online learning settings with sequential arrival of data

In summary, the paper puts forth a novel way to interpretably model multivariate marked point processes using neural networks. The methods uncover rich dependencies neglected by existing works.
