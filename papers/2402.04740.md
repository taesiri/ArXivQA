# [Non-Parametric Estimation of Multi-dimensional Marked Hawkes Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the problem of non-parametrically estimating the multidimensional marked Hawkes process. The marked Hawkes process is an extension of the Hawkes process that incorporates variable "marks" or characteristics associated with each event, unlike the Hawkes process where events have a constant impact. Estimating this process is challenging, especially in a non-parametric manner that preserves interpretability. Most existing methods make simplifying assumptions or rely on recurrent neural networks.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two neural network-based approaches for estimating marked Hawkes processes:

1) Shallow Neural Hawkes (SNH) with Marks: Tailored for linear marked Hawkes processes with only excitatory kernels. Uses a 2-layer feedforward network to represent the Hawkes kernel as a joint function of time and marks.

2) Neural Network for Non-Linear Hawkes (NNNH) with Marks: Handles non-linear marked Hawkes processes with both excitatory and inhibitory kernels. Uses a ReLU activation function to keep the intensity positive.

Both methods use stochastic gradient descent on the log-likelihood function for estimation. The models can capture interdependent effects of past event times and associated marks on intensity.

Main Contributions:

- First known non-parametric approach to estimate the marked Hawkes kernel as a combined function of time and marks
- Two flexible neural network methodologies proposed: SNH and NNNH adapted for marks 
- Evaluation on synthetic and real cryptocurrency data demonstrates ability to uncover dependencies neglected by other methods
- Kernels estimated from data provide interpretable insights into temporal and mark dependencies
- Approach is suited for online learning settings with sequential arrival of data

In summary, the paper puts forth a novel way to interpretably model multivariate marked point processes using neural networks. The methods uncover rich dependencies neglected by existing works.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel nonparametric neural network approach for estimating the conditional intensity function of multidimensional marked Hawkes processes using both the history of event times and associated marks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel non-parametric estimation technique for the marked Hawkes process, which is the first known approach capable of estimating the kernel as a joint function of time and marks. Specifically, it introduces two neural network-based models - Shallow Neural Hawkes (SNH) with marks and Neural Network for Non-Linear Hawkes (NNNH) with marks.

2. The paper applies the proposed estimation methods to synthetic datasets as well as real-world cryptocurrency trading data. It demonstrates the ability to uncover insights into the relationship between event arrival dynamics and associated marks, which can aid in understanding market microstructure. 

3. Compared to existing marked Hawkes estimation techniques, the proposed approach provides interpretability by estimating the kernel directly rather than just the intensity function. It also accommodates continuous marks and can handle both excitatory and inhibitory effects.

4. The use of stochastic gradient descent combined with Adam optimization provides the flexibility for online learning and updating model parameters as new data arrives.

In summary, the key innovation is a flexible nonparametric marked Hawkes estimation methodology based on neural networks that preserves interpretability while revealing the dependency structure between events and continuous marks. The application to real financial data highlights its practical utility.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Marked Hawkes process - An extension of the Hawkes process that features variable jump sizes across events, as opposed to the constant jump sizes in a regular Hawkes process.

- Non-parametric estimation - The paper proposes a non-parametric methodology to estimate the conditional intensity function of a marked Hawkes process. This is in contrast to parametric assumptions made in much of the existing literature. 

- Neural networks - The proposed methodology employs two-layer feedforward neural networks to approximate the kernels of marked Hawkes processes. Specifically, a Shallow Neural Hawkes (SNH) model and a Neural Network for Non-Linear Hawkes (NNNH) model are introduced.

- Cryptocurrency data - The neural network estimation approach is applied to real-world cryptocurrency market order data from Bitcoin and Ethereum trading. Order volumes serve as the "marks" in analyzing the impact of trade sizes on arrival intensities.

- Simulation - Thinning algorithms are used to simulate synthetic marked Hawkes process data for evaluating the performance of the proposed neural network models.

- Log-likelihood - The neural network parameters are estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood function of the marked Hawkes process through stochastic gradient descent.

So in summary, the key terms cover marked Hawkes processes, nonparametric estimation, neural networks, cryptocurrency data, simulation, and maximum likelihood estimation.
