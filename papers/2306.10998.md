# [RepoFusion: Training Code Models to Understand Your Repository](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10998)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can training code language models to incorporate and combine multiple relevant contexts from a code repository improve their performance on code completion tasks? The key hypothesis is that by training models like RepoFusion to leverage and fuse together multiple relevant code snippets from across a repository, they can generate more accurate and context-aware completions compared to models trained only on individual code files. The paper aims to demonstrate that smaller models trained in this way with repository context can outperform much larger language models trained on code without this contextual information.In summary, the main research question is whether training code models to understand and utilize repository-level context can enhance their capabilities, especially for code completion. The hypothesis is that models trained with the proposed RepoFusion framework will be better at code completion compared to models without access to repository information during training. The experiments aim to validate if training smaller models in a retrieval-augmented way with repository context can surpass bigger models trained on individual files.
