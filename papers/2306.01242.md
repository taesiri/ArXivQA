# [Responsible Task Automation: Empowering Large Language Models as   Responsible Task Automators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01242)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we make large language models (LLMs) behave more responsibly when acting as coordinators to automate tasks upon user instructions, through collaboration with domain-specific executors?The key aspects explored are:- Enhancing reliability of LLM-based coordinators and domain-specific executors working together, from the perspectives of feasibility, completeness, and security. - Presenting a framework called Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) to empower LLMs with capabilities for feasibility prediction, completeness verification, and security protection.- Investigating implementations of the core capabilities, comparing a prompt engineering approach leveraging LLMs' own knowledge versus using specialized domain models.- Demonstrating the framework on UI task automation and analyzing the effectiveness.In summary, the main hypothesis is that by empowering LLMs with specialized capabilities through the ResponsibleTA framework, they can collaborate with domain-specific executors more reliably and responsibly to automate tasks based on user instructions. The work seems to explore the feasibility of this hypothesis through analysis and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a framework called Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) for making large language models (LLMs) behave more responsibly when acting as coordinators to automate tasks. The main contributions are:1. The ResponsibleTA framework which augments LLMs with three capabilities: feasibility prediction, completeness verification, and security protection.2. Two paradigms for implementing feasibility prediction and completeness verification: leveraging the LLM's own knowledge via prompt engineering, and training separate domain-specific models. The results show domain-specific models perform better. 3. A local memory mechanism for security protection that allows sensitive user information to be stored and used only locally, avoiding transmission to the cloud.4. Evaluation of ResponsibleTA on UI task automation scenarios, showing it can effectively improve the success rate and efficiency of automated task completion.In summary, this paper explores how to make LLMs more reliable and responsible when automating tasks by empowering them with capabilities for feasibility checking, result verification, and privacy protection. The proposed ResponsibleTA framework and comparative study of implementation paradigms provide valuable insights into this emerging research direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a framework called Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) that aims to make large language models more reliable when used as coordinators to guide task execution, by empowering them with capabilities for predicting command feasibility, verifying execution completeness, and protecting user privacy through local memory.
