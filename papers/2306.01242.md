# [Responsible Task Automation: Empowering Large Language Models as   Responsible Task Automators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01242)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we make large language models (LLMs) behave more responsibly when acting as coordinators to automate tasks upon user instructions, through collaboration with domain-specific executors?The key aspects explored are:- Enhancing reliability of LLM-based coordinators and domain-specific executors working together, from the perspectives of feasibility, completeness, and security. - Presenting a framework called Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) to empower LLMs with capabilities for feasibility prediction, completeness verification, and security protection.- Investigating implementations of the core capabilities, comparing a prompt engineering approach leveraging LLMs' own knowledge versus using specialized domain models.- Demonstrating the framework on UI task automation and analyzing the effectiveness.In summary, the main hypothesis is that by empowering LLMs with specialized capabilities through the ResponsibleTA framework, they can collaborate with domain-specific executors more reliably and responsibly to automate tasks based on user instructions. The work seems to explore the feasibility of this hypothesis through analysis and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a framework called Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) for making large language models (LLMs) behave more responsibly when acting as coordinators to automate tasks. The main contributions are:1. The ResponsibleTA framework which augments LLMs with three capabilities: feasibility prediction, completeness verification, and security protection.2. Two paradigms for implementing feasibility prediction and completeness verification: leveraging the LLM's own knowledge via prompt engineering, and training separate domain-specific models. The results show domain-specific models perform better. 3. A local memory mechanism for security protection that allows sensitive user information to be stored and used only locally, avoiding transmission to the cloud.4. Evaluation of ResponsibleTA on UI task automation scenarios, showing it can effectively improve the success rate and efficiency of automated task completion.In summary, this paper explores how to make LLMs more reliable and responsible when automating tasks by empowering them with capabilities for feasibility checking, result verification, and privacy protection. The proposed ResponsibleTA framework and comparative study of implementation paradigms provide valuable insights into this emerging research direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a framework called Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) that aims to make large language models more reliable when used as coordinators to guide task execution, by empowering them with capabilities for predicting command feasibility, verifying execution completeness, and protecting user privacy through local memory.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a novel framework called Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) for improving the reliability and responsibility of large language models (LLMs) when used for task automation. The key capabilities introduced are feasibility prediction, completeness verification, and security protection. This addresses important concerns around alignment, safety, and privacy when delegating tasks to LLMs paired with domain-specific executors.- Other recent works have also explored improving the reliability of LLMs for task automation, but have focused on different aspects or proposed different techniques. For example:- CAN [1] trains an external model to criticize the action outputs of LLMs to improve their executability in simple robotic environments. ResponsibleTA takes a more systematic approach across feasibility, completeness and security for complex UI environments.- PlanBERT [2] incorporates execution feedback to improve the planning capabilities of LLMs. ResponsibleTA performs proactive verification before and after execution.- Palm [3] demonstrates LLMs for coordinating APIs/models for task automation, using descriptions of their capabilities. ResponsibleTA goes further to actively verify feasibility and completeness. - So in summary, ResponsibleTA makes novel contributions in its holistic framework covering feasibility, completeness and security, its introduction and comparison of implementation paradigms, and its application to complex UI task automation. The capabilities for proactive verification before and after execution are unique. The framework could provide a foundation for future benchmarking and research on responsible task automation.References:[1] CAN: Coverage-Aware Critic for Robust Task Execution (Ahn et al., 2022) [2] PlanBERT: Planning with Large Language Models (Wang et al., 2023)[3] PaLM: Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways (Chowdhery et al., 2022)


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing benchmarks and datasets for responsible task automation. The authors mention the lack of fledged benchmarks in this emerging research area. They call for the community to construct datasets and benchmarks to facilitate further research.- Designing and iterating on models to pursue high performance on this new task. The paper makes an initial attempt at proposing methods like the feasibility predictor and completeness verifier. But there is scope for designing better models for the various components of the ResponsibleTA framework.- Extending the framework with additional capabilities beyond feasibility, completeness and security. The authors propose ResponsibleTA as a starting point and suggest building on it by incorporating more functionalities to make LLMs behave responsibly in diverse scenarios.- Improving LLMs themselves to make their knowledge more comprehensive and reduce defects or biases. The authors note limitations of current LLMs' capabilities based on the failure case study. As LLMs continue to evolve, enhancing their knowledge could directly boost ResponsibleTA's reliability.- Exploring broader applications beyond UI task automation. The paper focuses on UI tasks as an application scenario. Applying ResponsibleTA to physical world automation or other digital use cases could be an interesting direction.In summary, the authors lay out improving benchmarks, models, framework functionalities, LLMs and exploring new applications as key directions to take this preliminary work on responsible task automation forward. Developing the evaluation methodology and framework itself are important open problems for the community to collectively address.
