# [Responsible Task Automation: Empowering Large Language Models as   Responsible Task Automators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01242)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we make large language models (LLMs) behave more responsibly when acting as coordinators to automate tasks upon user instructions, through collaboration with domain-specific executors?The key aspects explored are:- Enhancing reliability of LLM-based coordinators and domain-specific executors working together, from the perspectives of feasibility, completeness, and security. - Presenting a framework called Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) to empower LLMs with capabilities for feasibility prediction, completeness verification, and security protection.- Investigating implementations of the core capabilities, comparing a prompt engineering approach leveraging LLMs' own knowledge versus using specialized domain models.- Demonstrating the framework on UI task automation and analyzing the effectiveness.In summary, the main hypothesis is that by empowering LLMs with specialized capabilities through the ResponsibleTA framework, they can collaborate with domain-specific executors more reliably and responsibly to automate tasks based on user instructions. The work seems to explore the feasibility of this hypothesis through analysis and experiments.
