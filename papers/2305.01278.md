# [Transfer Visual Prompt Generator across LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01278)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that the visual prompt generator (VPG) component of vision-language large language models (VL-LLMs) can be effectively transferred across different backbone language models, rather than training a new VPG from scratch each time. 

The key research questions explored are:

- Can a VPG trained on one language model be transferred to a different sized language model of the same type (e.g. small to large OPT models) without significant performance loss?

- Can a VPG be transferred across different types of language models (e.g. encoder-only like OPT vs encoder-decoder like FlanT5) while maintaining performance?

- What are the key factors that enable efficient VPG transfer across language models?

- Can an effective framework or approach be developed to maximize VPG transferability and minimize the computational costs of building new VL-LLMs?

The central hypothesis is that transferring an existing well-tuned VPG to a new language model backbone should be more efficient than training a VPG from scratch each time. The paper investigates this hypothesis through empirical analysis and proposes a framework called VPGTrans to enable effective VPG transfer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for efficiently transferring a visual prompt generator (VPG) from one vision-language large language model (VL-LLM) to another VL-LLM. Specifically:

- The paper investigates the transferability of VPGs across LLMs of different sizes (small-to-large transfer) and across LLMs of different types (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder). 

- Through analysis, the paper identifies key factors that affect transfer efficiency, such as inheriting a trained VPG can accelerate training, warming up the linear projector prevents performance drops, and transferring from a smaller LLM src to a larger LLM tgt is easier.

- Based on these findings, the paper proposes a two-stage transfer framework called VPGTrans: 1) projector warm-up to initialize the target LLM's projector using word embeddings and train with large LR, 2) joint fine-tuning of VPG and projector.

- Experiments show VPGTrans achieves comparable performance with up to 10x speedup and 10x less training data compared to training VPG from scratch. The method is shown to work for both small-to-large LLM transfer and across LLM types.

- The paper demonstrates applying VPGTrans to build novel VL-LLMs like VL-LLaMA and VL-Vicuna by transferring VPG from existing VL-LLMs like BLIP-2.

In summary, the key contribution is an effective VPG transfer framework to efficiently build new VL-LLMs by reusing VPGs from existing models, avoiding expensive training from scratch. This can facilitate building custom VL-LLMs with new LLMs at lower cost.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage transfer learning framework called VPGTrans for efficiently transferring a visual prompt generator (VPG) from one vision-language large language model (VL-LLM) to another. The first stage initializes the VPG from a source VL-LLM and warms up the linear projector using a word embedding converter to align the VPG with the target LLM. The second stage fine-tunes the VPG and projector jointly. Experiments show VPGTrans achieves over 10x speedup transferring a VPG from BLIP-2 OPT2.7B to BLIP-2 OPT6.7B with better performance, using only 10.7% of the original training data. The method works for transfer across LLM sizes and types. Key findings are that smaller source LLMs transfer better across sizes, and only large LLMs enable efficient cross-type transfer. Overall, VPGTrans provides an effective way to build new VL-LLMs by transferring VPGs from existing models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for transferring visual prompt generators (VPGs) across different language models (LLMs). The key idea is to improve the efficiency of adapting an existing VPG trained on one LLM to a new target LLM, avoiding the high cost of training a VPG from scratch. 

The authors first diagnose key factors for maximizing VPG transfer efficiency through exploratory experiments. Based on observations, they design a two-stage transfer framework called VPGTrans. Stage 1 warms up the linear projector using word embedding initialization and large learning rates. Stage 2 directly fine-tunes the VPG and projector jointly. Experiments show VPGTrans achieves over 10x speedup for VPG transfer across LLM sizes (2.7B to 6.7B OPT models) and 5x for transfer across LLM types (OPT to Flan-T5). The method also enables training with 10x less data without performance drops. Intriguingly, transfer from smaller source LLMs is more efficient. The authors showcase VPGTrans by building novel VL-LLaMA and VL-Vicuna models efficiently.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes a two-stage transfer learning framework called VPGTrans for transferring a visual prompt generator (VPG) from one vision-language large language model (VL-LLM) to another. In the first stage, the VPG from a source VL-LLM is inherited and its linear projector is initialized by merging it with a word embedding converter trained between the source and target LLM word embeddings. The projector is then warmed up with a large learning rate for 1 epoch while freezing the VPG and target LLM. In the second stage, the VPG and projector are jointly fine-tuned for several epochs with a normal learning rate. This allows transferring the VPG to a target VL-LLM with significantly reduced computational cost and training data while maintaining performance. The method is evaluated by transferring VPGs across VL-LLMs of different sizes and types, achieving up to 10x speedup and using only 10% of the original training data.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper investigates the transferability of visual prompt generators (VPGs) across different language models (LMs) for building multimodal LMs (MLLMs). The authors propose a simple yet highly effective two-stage transfer learning framework called VPGTrans. In the first stage, the projector is warmed up to avoid performance drops when adapting a pre-trained VPG to a new LM. This is done by initializing the projector using a word embedding converter and training with a large learning rate. The second stage fine-tunes the VPG and projector normally. Experiments show VPGTrans can transfer VPGs across different LM sizes and types with minimal performance loss while greatly reducing training costs. For example, transferring VPG from OPT-2.7B to OPT-6.7B achieves comparable results with 10x less GPU hours and data. Intriguingly, smaller LMs are better VPG sources, likely because larger embedding spaces degrade fine-grained perception during VPG training. The authors use VPGTrans to build the first multimodal LLaMA and Vicuna models. Limitations are reliance on aligned VPGs and safety issues common to generative models. Overall, this is an important step towards customizable and efficient MLLMs.
