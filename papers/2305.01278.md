# Transfer Visual Prompt Generator across LLMs

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that the visual prompt generator (VPG) component of vision-language large language models (VL-LLMs) can be effectively transferred across different backbone language models, rather than training a new VPG from scratch each time. The key research questions explored are:- Can a VPG trained on one language model be transferred to a different sized language model of the same type (e.g. small to large OPT models) without significant performance loss?- Can a VPG be transferred across different types of language models (e.g. encoder-only like OPT vs encoder-decoder like FlanT5) while maintaining performance?- What are the key factors that enable efficient VPG transfer across language models?- Can an effective framework or approach be developed to maximize VPG transferability and minimize the computational costs of building new VL-LLMs?The central hypothesis is that transferring an existing well-tuned VPG to a new language model backbone should be more efficient than training a VPG from scratch each time. The paper investigates this hypothesis through empirical analysis and proposes a framework called VPGTrans to enable effective VPG transfer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for efficiently transferring a visual prompt generator (VPG) from one vision-language large language model (VL-LLM) to another VL-LLM. Specifically:- The paper investigates the transferability of VPGs across LLMs of different sizes (small-to-large transfer) and across LLMs of different types (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder). - Through analysis, the paper identifies key factors that affect transfer efficiency, such as inheriting a trained VPG can accelerate training, warming up the linear projector prevents performance drops, and transferring from a smaller LLM src to a larger LLM tgt is easier.- Based on these findings, the paper proposes a two-stage transfer framework called VPGTrans: 1) projector warm-up to initialize the target LLM's projector using word embeddings and train with large LR, 2) joint fine-tuning of VPG and projector.- Experiments show VPGTrans achieves comparable performance with up to 10x speedup and 10x less training data compared to training VPG from scratch. The method is shown to work for both small-to-large LLM transfer and across LLM types.- The paper demonstrates applying VPGTrans to build novel VL-LLMs like VL-LLaMA and VL-Vicuna by transferring VPG from existing VL-LLMs like BLIP-2.In summary, the key contribution is an effective VPG transfer framework to efficiently build new VL-LLMs by reusing VPGs from existing models, avoiding expensive training from scratch. This can facilitate building custom VL-LLMs with new LLMs at lower cost.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage transfer learning framework called VPGTrans that enables efficiently transferring a visual prompt generator (VPG) from an existing vision-language large language model (VL-LLM) to a new target LLM, allowing building a new VL-LLM at much lower cost.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related research on transferring visual prompt generators (VPGs) across vision-language large language models (VL-LLMs):- This paper conducts a thorough investigation into transferring VPGs across different LLM sizes (e.g. small-to-large transfer) as well as different LLM types (e.g. decoder-only vs encoder-decoder). Most prior work has focused on transferring task prompts across models, rather than exploring content prompt transfer for VL tasks.- Based on analysis of factors impacting transfer efficiency, the authors propose VPGTrans - a simple yet effective two-stage transfer learning framework. This provides a new way to build VL-LLMs by transferring VPGs instead of training from scratch.- The paper reveals several interesting findings around VPG transfer, like the counterintuitive "smaller source LLM, easier transfer" trend. It also discusses potential explanations behind these observations.- Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates 10x speedups and >10% data reductions via VPGTrans, outperforming original models in some cases. This has practical value for the LLM community.- As an application, the paper shows how to customize new VL-LLMs (VL-LLaMA, VL-Vicuna) by transferring VPGs from existing models. This provides a template for building new VL-LLMs efficiently.Overall, this paper provides novel analysis and methods for VPG transfer that can facilitate faster, cheaper development of VL-LLMs. The findings, performance improvements, and practical customization demonstrate the value of the VPGTrans approach compared to prior work. The transfer insights could inform future research on adapting VL-LLMs.
