# [Transfer Visual Prompt Generator across LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01278)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that the visual prompt generator (VPG) component of vision-language large language models (VL-LLMs) can be effectively transferred across different backbone language models, rather than training a new VPG from scratch each time. The key research questions explored are:- Can a VPG trained on one language model be transferred to a different sized language model of the same type (e.g. small to large OPT models) without significant performance loss?- Can a VPG be transferred across different types of language models (e.g. encoder-only like OPT vs encoder-decoder like FlanT5) while maintaining performance?- What are the key factors that enable efficient VPG transfer across language models?- Can an effective framework or approach be developed to maximize VPG transferability and minimize the computational costs of building new VL-LLMs?The central hypothesis is that transferring an existing well-tuned VPG to a new language model backbone should be more efficient than training a VPG from scratch each time. The paper investigates this hypothesis through empirical analysis and proposes a framework called VPGTrans to enable effective VPG transfer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for efficiently transferring a visual prompt generator (VPG) from one vision-language large language model (VL-LLM) to another VL-LLM. Specifically:- The paper investigates the transferability of VPGs across LLMs of different sizes (small-to-large transfer) and across LLMs of different types (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder). - Through analysis, the paper identifies key factors that affect transfer efficiency, such as inheriting a trained VPG can accelerate training, warming up the linear projector prevents performance drops, and transferring from a smaller LLM src to a larger LLM tgt is easier.- Based on these findings, the paper proposes a two-stage transfer framework called VPGTrans: 1) projector warm-up to initialize the target LLM's projector using word embeddings and train with large LR, 2) joint fine-tuning of VPG and projector.- Experiments show VPGTrans achieves comparable performance with up to 10x speedup and 10x less training data compared to training VPG from scratch. The method is shown to work for both small-to-large LLM transfer and across LLM types.- The paper demonstrates applying VPGTrans to build novel VL-LLMs like VL-LLaMA and VL-Vicuna by transferring VPG from existing VL-LLMs like BLIP-2.In summary, the key contribution is an effective VPG transfer framework to efficiently build new VL-LLMs by reusing VPGs from existing models, avoiding expensive training from scratch. This can facilitate building custom VL-LLMs with new LLMs at lower cost.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related research on transferring visual prompt generators (VPGs) across vision-language large language models (VL-LLMs):- This paper conducts a thorough investigation into transferring VPGs across different LLM sizes (e.g. small-to-large transfer) as well as different LLM types (e.g. decoder-only vs encoder-decoder). Most prior work has focused on transferring task prompts across models, rather than exploring content prompt transfer for VL tasks.- Based on analysis of factors impacting transfer efficiency, the authors propose VPGTrans - a simple yet effective two-stage transfer learning framework. This provides a new way to build VL-LLMs by transferring VPGs instead of training from scratch.- The paper reveals several interesting findings around VPG transfer, like the counterintuitive "smaller source LLM, easier transfer" trend. It also discusses potential explanations behind these observations.- Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates 10x speedups and >10% data reductions via VPGTrans, outperforming original models in some cases. This has practical value for the LLM community.- As an application, the paper shows how to customize new VL-LLMs (VL-LLaMA, VL-Vicuna) by transferring VPGs from existing models. This provides a template for building new VL-LLMs efficiently.Overall, this paper provides novel analysis and methods for VPG transfer that can facilitate faster, cheaper development of VL-LLMs. The findings, performance improvements, and practical customization demonstrate the value of the VPGTrans approach compared to prior work. The transfer insights could inform future research on adapting VL-LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing methods to better understand and analyze the soft prompts learned by vision-language models. The authors suggest that gaining more insight into how soft prompts represent visual concepts could help improve prompt transfer techniques.- Exploring prompt transfer between larger language models. The authors found prompt transfer worked better between larger LLMs, so they suggest further study on prompt transfer techniques tailored for large models.- Studying differences between content prompts and task prompts. The authors note their content prompt transfer setting has fewer limitations than task prompt transfer, so investigating these differences more thoroughly could be beneficial.- Improving the visual perception ability of customized VL-LLMs built with prompt transfer. The authors acknowledge some limitations in the visual understanding of their VL-Vicuna model, suggesting room for improvement.- Associating prompt transfer techniques with methods for training safer and more robust VL-LLMs. The authors propose this could help mitigate risks from false visual understanding.- Overall, continuing research on understanding and improving prompt transferability to enable building performant yet affordable VL-LLMs. This includes aspects like better converter techniques, optimal transfer learning hyperparameters, etc.In summary, the main future directions relate to better understanding prompt learning and transfer, developing specialized techniques for large models, and improving visual understanding - all towards building better VL-LLMs efficiently.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage transfer learning framework called VPGTrans for efficiently transferring a visual prompt generator (VPG) from one vision-language large language model (VL-LLM) to another. The first stage initializes the VPG from a source VL-LLM and warms up the linear projector using a word embedding converter to align the VPG with the target LLM. The second stage fine-tunes the VPG and projector jointly. Experiments show VPGTrans achieves over 10x speedup transferring a VPG from BLIP-2 OPT2.7B to BLIP-2 OPT6.7B with better performance, using only 10.7% of the original training data. The method works for transfer across LLM sizes and types. Key findings are that smaller source LLMs transfer better across sizes, and only large LLMs enable efficient cross-type transfer. Overall, VPGTrans provides an effective way to build new VL-LLMs by transferring VPGs from existing models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel method for transferring visual prompt generators (VPGs) across different language models (LLMs). The key idea is to improve the efficiency of adapting an existing VPG trained on one LLM to a new target LLM, avoiding the high cost of training a VPG from scratch. The authors first diagnose key factors for maximizing VPG transfer efficiency through exploratory experiments. Based on observations, they design a two-stage transfer framework called VPGTrans. Stage 1 warms up the linear projector using word embedding initialization and large learning rates. Stage 2 directly fine-tunes the VPG and projector jointly. Experiments show VPGTrans achieves over 10x speedup for VPG transfer across LLM sizes (2.7B to 6.7B OPT models) and 5x for transfer across LLM types (OPT to Flan-T5). The method also enables training with 10x less data without performance drops. Intriguingly, transfer from smaller source LLMs is more efficient. The authors showcase VPGTrans by building novel VL-LLaMA and VL-Vicuna models efficiently.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper proposes a two-stage transfer learning framework called VPGTrans for transferring a visual prompt generator (VPG) from one vision-language large language model (VL-LLM) to another. In the first stage, the VPG from a source VL-LLM is inherited and its linear projector is initialized by merging it with a word embedding converter trained between the source and target LLM word embeddings. The projector is then warmed up with a large learning rate for 1 epoch while freezing the VPG and target LLM. In the second stage, the VPG and projector are jointly fine-tuned for several epochs with a normal learning rate. This allows transferring the VPG to a target VL-LLM with significantly reduced computational cost and training data while maintaining performance. The method is evaluated by transferring VPGs across VL-LLMs of different sizes and types, achieving up to 10x speedup and using only 10% of the original training data.
