# [Learning the irreversible progression trajectory of Alzheimer's disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06087)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive brain disorder. Existing machine learning models for predicting AD stages from longitudinal data often make fluctuating predictions for the same subject across visits, violating the expected monotonic increase of disease risk. This reduces trustworthiness of models.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel regularization technique to enforce monotonicity of predicted risk trajectories for individual subjects over time. Specifically, they introduce a loss term that encourages the model predictions to be non-decreasing between consecutive visits as well as all visits of the same subject. This loss term depends on the feature embeddings and time difference between visits.

Key Contributions:
- Formulate a regularization loss based on cosine similarity between feature embeddings of consecutive and all visit pairs per subject, weighted by time differences. This bounds and penalizes violations of monotonicity.
- Evaluate on longitudinal structural MRI and amyloid PET data from ADNI dataset across multiple classification tasks. Demonstrate improved monotonicity and comparable accuracy to baseline models.
- Propose measurements of violation ratio and gap to quantify monotonicity. Show strong correlation between them. 
- Visualize improved continuity of risk trajectories over time after regularization, even when diagnosis is unchanged across visits.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to inject prior knowledge of AD progression irreversibility into machine learning models to improve prediction trajectory continuity without sacrificing accuracy. The proposed regularization approach is generic and can potentially benefit other problems involving longitudinal data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel regularization approach to predict Alzheimer's disease progression longitudinally by enforcing monotonicity of risk predictions across follow-up visits to align with the irreversible nature of the disease.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel regularization approach to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression longitudinally. Specifically:

- They introduce a monotonicity constraint that encourages the model to predict disease risk scores for the same subject in a consistent and ordered manner across their follow-up visits. This aligns with the prior knowledge that AD progression is irreversible. 

- They evaluate their proposed regularized model on longitudinal structural MRI and amyloid PET imaging data from ADNI. The results demonstrate that their model successfully captures the expected monotonic increase of disease risk across visits for individual subjects, while preserving overall prediction accuracy compared to unregularized models.

- More broadly, they show how incorporating domain knowledge as a regularization can improve model trustworthiness and consistency with known mechanisms of disease progression, without sacrificing expressive power. Their approach is generalizable to other problems involving longitudinal predictions.

In summary, the key innovation is using an irreversibility constraint based on the AD domain to regularize longitudinal predictions, enhancing model trustworthiness while maintaining accuracy. The regularization helps better capture individual disease trajectories over time.

The paper proposes a regularization approach to predict Alzheimer's disease progression longitudinally across multiple visits using structural MRI and amyloid PET imaging data. Key ideas include enforcing monotonicity of predicted disease risk trajectories to align with the irreversibility of AD, improving model trustworthiness, and capturing subtle progression in early stages. The method is evaluated on classifying different disease stages. Overall, the key focus is on modeling the irreversible progression of AD in a more reliable way by incorporating domain knowledge as a regularizer.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a regularization approach to enforce monotonicity of predicted disease risk across follow-up visits. What is the intuition behind using a regularization approach rather than directly modifying the model architecture or loss function? What are the advantages of this approach?

2. The complete regularization term considers all possible pairs of visits and weights them by the time difference. What is the rationale behind weighting the pairs by time difference? How does this weighting scheme affect which violations are penalized more?

3. The paper evaluates monotonicity using both a violation ratio and a normalized violation gap. What is the difference between these two metrics and why use both? What relationship was found between these metrics in the experiments?

4. What types of baseline models were compared to the proposed regularized MLP? Why was an unregularized MLP with the same architecture chosen for comparison rather than other models? What does this comparison demonstrate?

5. How exactly is the regularization term incorporated into the loss function? What is the $\gamma$ hyperparameter and how was its value determined? How does this balance the regularization and main classification loss?

6. The regularization is only applied to the MLP model in the experiments. Do you think the regularization approach could be effectively applied to other types of models like XGBoost or Random Forests? How might it need to be adapted?

7. For computational efficiency, the regularization uses random sampling of subjects for the MRI data. How large is this dataset compared to the amyloid PET data? Why is random sampling reasonable here?

8. The visualizations show improved monotonicity for subjects with the same diagnosis over time. What does this suggest about the potential to model subtle early progression with this approach?

9. Do you think any important information could be lost or noise introduced by overly enforcing monotonicity across visits? How could the effects of the regularization be analyzed further?

10. The regularization encodes a strong prior about AD progression. What other types of prior knowledge could be effectively encoded as regularizations? What challenges might arise in developing appropriate regularization terms?
