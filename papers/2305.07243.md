# [Better speech synthesis through scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07243)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can recent advances in image generation using autoregressive transformers and diffusion models be applied to improve the quality and expressiveness of text-to-speech systems?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Autoregressive transformers can be used to generate high-quality discrete speech representations (tokens) from text inputs. 

2) Diffusion models can then convert those discrete speech tokens into realistic and expressive speech waveforms.

3) Conditioning the models on speaker embeddings can allow for multi-speaker text-to-speech with cloned voices.

4) Scaling up datasets, compute, and model capacity leads to better results compared to prior TTS systems.

So in summary, the central research direction is leveraging advances in image generation to build a new text-to-speech pipeline that combines autoregressive and diffusion models, conditioned on speaker identity, and scaled up in data and compute. The hypothesis is that this approach can surpass the state-of-the-art in TTS realism and expressiveness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting TorToise, a text-to-speech system that combines autoregressive transformers and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate high-quality and expressive speech from text input. The key ideas presented are:

- Using an autoregressive transformer to convert text to speech tokens, which are then decoded into speech spectrograms by a DDPM. This allows leveraging the benefits of both architectures - the autoregressive model handles the unaligned text-to-speech mapping while the DDPM generates high-fidelity spectrograms. 

- Introducing a speech conditioning input to the autoregressive and DDPM models which provides vocal characteristics like tone and prosody to reduce the output search space.

- Using a contrastive model called CLVP to rank multiple outputs from the autoregressive model and pick the top candidates for DDPM decoding. This helps improve output quality.

- Fine-tuning the DDPM on the autoregressive latent space instead of just speech tokens. This "TorToise trick" greatly improves DDPM efficiency and output quality.

- Training the system on a large dataset of 896 hours of clean data plus 49,000 hours of extended scraped data. Scaling model size and data results in state-of-the-art performance.

So in summary, the main contribution is the TorToise text-to-speech system architecture and training methodology that sets a new state-of-the-art in speech synthesis quality through the use of scalable deep learning models and large datasets.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents TorToise, a multi-voice expressive text-to-speech system that combines autoregressive transformers and denoising diffusion probabilistic models to generate high-quality and diverse speech from text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other TTS research:

- It takes inspiration from recent advances in image generation like DALL-E and DDPMs and applies them to the speech domain. This shows how progress in one domain (images) can be leveraged to improve another (speech).

- It uses a very large dataset of audiobooks/podcasts (49,000 hours) which is much bigger than what most other TTS papers use. This allows the model to learn from more data.

- The model architecture combines autoregressive modeling, diffusion models, and contrastive learning in an innovative way. Each component handles a different part of the problem (text-to-latent, latent-to-spectrogram, ranking outputs).

- The results seem state-of-the-art in terms of naturalness and expressiveness. The samples sound very human-like compared to other TTS systems.

- Most other TTS papers focus on model efficiency and real-time use cases. This paper focuses more on maximizing output quality regardless of compute requirements.

- The code and models are open-sourced, allowing reproducibility and extension by others. Many top TTS systems are closed source which makes comparisons difficult.

Overall, it pushes TTS quality to new levels through large datasets, scaling up models, and borrowing ideas from the image generation field. The focus is more on end results rather than deployment concerns.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Constricting the VQVAE codebook embedding dimension. The authors suggest this has been shown to produce drastic performance improvements.

- Using relative positional encodings in the autoregressive model instead of fixed encodings. This would allow the model to generate speech of arbitrary lengths. 

- Training the CLVP model with larger batch sizes and on longer audio sequences. The authors note CLVP was only trained on 13 second clips, limiting its effectiveness for reranking longer samples.

- Modifying the diffusion decoder architecture to include feedforward blocks instead of just self-attention. The authors suggest omitting feedforward blocks was a poor design choice. 

- Training the entire model stack at a consistent sampling rate, either 22kHz or 24kHz. The current mismatch creates complications.

- Training on more data for longer. The authors believe there is still room to improve simply by training for longer on more data before overfitting.

In general, the authors recommend architectural tweaks to improve individual components and longer training with more data to further improve the overall system.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents TorToise, a text-to-speech system that combines recent advances in image generation using autoregressive transformers and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate high-quality and expressive speech from text input. The system uses an autoregressive transformer to convert text to speech tokens, a contrastive model called CLVP to rank the speech candidates, and a DDPM to convert the speech tokens to speech spectrograms. The autoregressive and DDPM models are conditioned on reference audio of the target speaker to aid in vocal cloning. The system is trained on a large dataset compiled from audiobooks and podcasts. Experiments show TorToise generates more realistic and expressive speech compared to previous TTS systems by utilizing these general model architectures, large datasets, and large-scale training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes TorToise, a new state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) system that combines recent advances in autoregressive models and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) from the image generation field. The key insight is to use an autoregressive model to convert text into a sequence of discrete speech tokens, and then use a DDPM to convert those tokens into high quality speech spectrograms. This allows the strengths of the two approaches to be combined - the alignment ability of autoregressive models and the ability of DDPMs to generate sharp, coherent outputs. 

The system uses several components: an autoregressive decoder to generate speech tokens from text, a CLVP model to rank and select the top tokens, a diffusion model to convert tokens to speech, and a vocoder to convert spectrograms to audio. It leverages large datasets, scaling model size and compute power, and architectural tweaks like "the TorToise trick" - fine-tuning the diffusion model on the autoregressive latent space. Experiments show it surpasses previous TTS systems, demonstrating the power of combining recent advances in generative modeling. The code and models have been open sourced.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel text-to-speech synthesis method called TorToise that combines autoregressive transformers with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). It uses an autoregressive decoder to convert text tokens into speech tokens. These speech tokens are then fed into a DDPM that decodes them into high quality speech spectrograms. Additionally, the outputs of the autoregressive decoder are re-ranked using a contrastive model called CLVP that scores text-speech pairs similarly to CLIP. This allows the model to sample multiple candidates and pick the highest quality one. The autoregressive decoder and DDPM also make use of a speech conditioning input derived from reference audio clips to aid in inferring tone and prosody. The combination of these techniques allows TorToise to generate very realistic sounding multi-speaker speech from text.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is how to improve the quality and expressiveness of text-to-speech (TTS) systems using techniques from the image generation domain. Specifically, the paper proposes combining autoregressive transformer models and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), which have shown success in generating high-quality and diverse images, to create a new TTS system called TorToise.

Some of the key questions and goals of the paper seem to be:

- How can techniques like autoregressive decoding and DDPMs be adapted from the image domain to the speech domain? 

- Can marrying autoregressive and diffusion models allow taking advantage of the strengths of each?

- How can a large dataset of unlabeled speech data be leveraged to train high-quality generative models for TTS?

- Can a conditioning technique allow controlling the vocal characteristics like speaker identity? 

- Can sampling and ranking techniques produce more diverse and natural speech outputs?

So in summary, the main focus is on improving TTS quality and expressiveness by bringing over techniques from image generation, using a large dataset, and combining complementary model architectures.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes TorToise, a new text-to-speech system that combines recent advances in image generation using autoregressive transformers and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to produce high-quality and expressive speech synthesis. The system consists of four main components: an autoregressive decoder that predicts speech tokens from text, a contrastive model called CLVP that scores text-speech pairs, a DDPM that converts the predicted speech tokens into mel spectrograms, and a vocoder that converts the mel spectrograms into waveforms. The autoregressive decoder handles the unaligned mapping between text and speech while the DDPM operates in the continuous domain to generate expressive results. The system is trained on nearly 1 million hours of transcribed speech data. A key contribution is fine-tuning the DDPM on the autoregressive latent space instead of discrete tokens, greatly improving output quality. Inference involves sampling and ranking multiple candidates to pick the top speech outputs. Experiments show TorToise produces state-of-the-art speech synthesis by leveraging large datasets and scaling up model size and compute.

TorToise uses an autoregressive model to convert text tokens into speech tokens. It then uses a DDPM to decode the speech tokens into high-quality mel spectrograms representing the spoken audio.

Experiments show TorToise produces extremely realistic and expressive speech from text input. The modular architecture uses recent advances in generative modeling of images and text.
