# [Better speech synthesis through scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07243)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can recent advances in image generation using autoregressive transformers and diffusion models be applied to improve the quality and expressiveness of text-to-speech systems?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Autoregressive transformers can be used to generate high-quality discrete speech representations (tokens) from text inputs. 2) Diffusion models can then convert those discrete speech tokens into realistic and expressive speech waveforms.3) Conditioning the models on speaker embeddings can allow for multi-speaker text-to-speech with cloned voices.4) Scaling up datasets, compute, and model capacity leads to better results compared to prior TTS systems.So in summary, the central research direction is leveraging advances in image generation to build a new text-to-speech pipeline that combines autoregressive and diffusion models, conditioned on speaker identity, and scaled up in data and compute. The hypothesis is that this approach can surpass the state-of-the-art in TTS realism and expressiveness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting TorToise, a text-to-speech system that combines autoregressive transformers and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate high-quality and expressive speech from text input. The key ideas presented are:- Using an autoregressive transformer to convert text to speech tokens, which are then decoded into speech spectrograms by a DDPM. This allows leveraging the benefits of both architectures - the autoregressive model handles the unaligned text-to-speech mapping while the DDPM generates high-fidelity spectrograms. - Introducing a speech conditioning input to the autoregressive and DDPM models which provides vocal characteristics like tone and prosody to reduce the output search space.- Using a contrastive model called CLVP to rank multiple outputs from the autoregressive model and pick the top candidates for DDPM decoding. This helps improve output quality.- Fine-tuning the DDPM on the autoregressive latent space instead of just speech tokens. This "TorToise trick" greatly improves DDPM efficiency and output quality.- Training the system on a large dataset of 896 hours of clean data plus 49,000 hours of extended scraped data. Scaling model size and data results in state-of-the-art performance.So in summary, the main contribution is the TorToise text-to-speech system architecture and training methodology that sets a new state-of-the-art in speech synthesis quality through the use of scalable deep learning models and large datasets.
