# [WorldCoder, a Model-Based LLM Agent: Building World Models by Writing   Code and Interacting with the Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Traditional model-based reinforcement learning methods rely on random exploration to acquire training data, which is highly sample-inefficient. 
- The paper proposes a more sample-efficient exploration strategy driven by "optimism under uncertainty".

Method:
- The proposed method uses a learned world model to plan imaginary trajectories that lead to the goal. 
- This guides the agent's actual exploration towards states where the model is incorrect or missing critical information.
- Two model constraints are used: (1) data consistency and (2) "optimism under uncertainty". 
- The second constraint requires the model to imagine a path to the goal from any state, even if spurious.

Theoretical Analysis: 
- With this exploration strategy, the maximum number of actions to learn the true environment model scales polynomially rather than exponentially with state space size.
- A theorem is presented that upper bounds the number of actions to find the true model.
- Key insight: model errors force the collection of new data that rules out incorrect models.

Experiments:
- The method is tested in MiniGrid environments which have partial observability and sparse rewards.
- It significantly outperforms PPO in terms of sample efficiency. 
- An example learning trajectory is shown that illustrates efficient guided exploration via the "optimism under uncertainty" objective.

Main Contributions:
- A sample-efficient model-based reinforcement learning algorithm driven by optimism under uncertainty.
- Theoretical guarantee on number of actions to learn the true environment model.  
- Empirical demonstrations of improved sample efficiency over a strong baseline.

In summary, the key idea is to use an imperfect model optimistically to focus exploration on the most informative states in order to learn the true model much faster. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate this to be highly sample efficient.
