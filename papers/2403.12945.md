# [DROID: A Large-Scale In-The-Wild Robot Manipulation Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12945)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
Current robot manipulation policies are limited in their ability to generalize to new scenes, objects and tasks. This is largely due to the fact that they are trained on datasets collected in a small number of controlled lab environments with limited diversity. Creating large-scale, diverse robot manipulation datasets is challenging as it requires substantial investments in hardware, human supervision and ensuring safety. There is a need for more diverse robot manipulation datasets to enable training of more generalizable policies.

Proposed Solution:
The authors introduce DROID, a large-scale robot manipulation dataset collected by 50 data collectors across 13 institutions over 12 months. The dataset contains over 76,000 trajectories spanning 564 scenes, 86 tasks, and 52 buildings. The data was collected using a standardized robot hardware setup consisting of a Franka robot arm with multiple synchronized camera streams. Natural language instructions were collected for each demonstration via crowdsourcing. 

The dataset was analyzed along multiple axes - tasks, objects, scenes etc. DROID provides an order of magnitude more scene diversity compared to prior datasets with scenes covering a wide range of real-world environments. The distribution of skills based on language instructions shows a heavy tail indicating significant behavioral diversity. DROID also includes diverse viewpoints and interaction locations in the robot's workspace.

The authors demonstrate that training policies with DROID as additional data boosts success rates by over 20% on average and improves generalization ability compared to using existing datasets or training without any additional data.

Main Contributions:

- Collection and open-sourcing of DROID, the largest and most diverse robot manipulation dataset to date with 76k trajectories spanning 564 scenes and 86 tasks

- Analysis of DROID along multiple axes showing order-of-magnitude improvements in scene diversity and tail of skills distribution

- Demonstrating improved policy performance by 20% on average via pre-training on DROID across 6 tasks in simulation and real-world settings

- Releasing robot hardware specifications to replicate the standardized data collection platform used to collect DROID across 13 institutions
