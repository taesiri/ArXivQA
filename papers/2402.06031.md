# [An operator learning perspective on parameter-to-observable maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06031)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many scientific and engineering tasks involve predicting quantities of interest (QoIs) that depend on parametrized physical models, like partial differential equations (PDEs). Typically, only finite-dimensional inputs (parameters) or outputs (QoIs) are available, not full-field data. This paper studies how to extend operator learning methods, which learn mappings between function spaces, to handle such finite-dimensional inputs/outputs. A key question is whether it is better to directly learn the parameter-to-QoI (PtO) map or to first learn the full PDE solution operator and then evaluate the QoI.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces Fourier Neural Mappings (FNMs) as an operator learning architecture compatible with finite-dimensional inputs or outputs. FNMs contain specialized linear layers for mapping vectors to functions and vice versa. Four FNM variants are studied: vector-to-vector (V2V), vector-to-function (V2F), function-to-vector (F2V), and function-to-function (F2F). The method retains universal approximation capabilities. For linear PtO maps factored into a QoI and a forward operator, a statistical learning theory analysis reveals that F2F learning of the forward operator combined with computing the QoI (full-field approach) enjoys better sample complexity than directly learning the PtO map V2V (end-to-end approach), at least when the QoI is smooth.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes Fourier Neural Mappings to accommodate finite-dimensional inputs/outputs with operator learning

2) Proves universal approximation theorems for the FNMs

3) Develops a statistical learning theory for end-to-end and full-field learning of linear PtO maps

4) Provides theory suggesting full-field approach is more data-efficient for smooth QoIs

5) Performs experiments on nonlinear problems showing full-field outperforms end-to-end, aligning with linear theory

In summary, this paper introduces a way to apply operator learning to finite-dimensional parametrizations and observables while also providing theoretical and empirical evidence that learning through intermediate function spaces can be beneficial compared to direct end-to-end learning.
