# [The fractional chromatic number of double cones over graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.0774)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the main research question this paper addresses is determining the fractional chromatic number of the $(H,h)$-cone over a graph $G$, which is a generalization of the cone construction over a graph. Specifically, for a graph $G$ and a mapping $h: V(H) \to \mathbb{N}$, the $(H,h)$-cone over $G$, denoted $\Delta_{H,h}(G)$, is constructed by taking copies of the $h(v)$th cone over $G$ for each vertex $v$ of $H$, connecting them according to the edges of $H$, and identifying the bases. The paper focuses on the case where $h$ is a constant function, i.e. $h(v)=n$ for all $v \in V(H)$, denoted as $\Delta_{H,n}(G)$. The main result is completely determining the fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(\Delta_{H,n}(G))$ for any graphs $G$ and $H$ with $\chi_f(H) \le \chi_f(G)$ and any positive integer $n$. The fractional chromatic number is expressed as a function of $\chi_f(G)$, $\chi_f(H)$ and $n$.So in summary, the central research question is determining the fractional chromatic number of the generalized cone construction $\Delta_{H,h}(G)$, with a focus on the case of constant $h$. The main contribution is completely resolving this for $\Delta_{H,n}(G)$ when $\chi_f(H) \le \chi_f(G)$.
