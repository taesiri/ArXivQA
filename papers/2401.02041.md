# [Efficient Cloud-edge Collaborative Inference for Object   Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional re-identification (ReID) systems follow a centralized processing paradigm where all computation happens on the cloud server while edge devices only capture and send images. This paradigm is becoming impractical due to the rapid increase in number of videos and finite computational resources of cloud servers. Therefore, ReID systems need to shift to a cloud-edge collaborative processing paradigm to improve scalability and practicality. However, current work lacks research on adapting ReID methods effectively to this new paradigm.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel cloud-edge collaborative inference framework for ReID systems. The key ideas are:

1) Adjust the batch size of images uploaded from each edge device to the cloud based on spatial-temporal correlations learned by a distribution-aware correlation modeling network (DaCM). This allows devices with higher chance of containing the desired image to upload more images per batch.

2) Re-rank the upload sequence of images on each edge device by combining visual similarity and spatial-temporal correlations from DaCM. This pushes images more likely to match the query earlier in the sequence.  

The DaCM embeds spatial-temporal correlations into a graph structure and uses graph convolutions to learn cross-camera relationships. It is deployed on both cloud and edges to enable the above two optimizations.

Main Contributions:

1) First cloud-edge collaborative inference framework specialized for ReID that aims to optimize efficiency rather than just accuracy.

2) Novel DaCM network to model spatial-temporal correlations across cameras and enable efficient uploading from edges to cloud.

3) New evaluation protocols like mean Transmission Number and precise Rank for assessing efficiency.

4) Extensive experiments showing the approach reduces transmission overhead, improves re-id accuracy, and enables the new task of time-constrained re-id.

5) Demonstration of integrating DaCM with various existing ReID methods for performance improvements.

The paper proposes a cloud-edge collaborative framework for efficient inference in object ReID systems. The key idea is to use a distribution-aware correlation modeling network (DaCM) to model the spatial-temporal correlations in the ReID data and use that to optimize bandwidth allocation across edge devices and adjust the image upload sequence. This allows reducing the amount of data transmission and returning desired images to the cloud faster. The paper also introduces the concept of time-constrained ReID and new evaluation metrics like mean transmission number and precise rank to showcase the efficiency. Overall, the key focus is on inference efficiency in a collaborative cloud-edge setting for ReID using spatial-temporal modeling.
