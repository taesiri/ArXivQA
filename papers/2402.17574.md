# [Agent-Pro: Learning to Evolve via Policy-Level Reflection and   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Agent-Pro: Learning to Evolve via Policy-Level Reflection and Optimization":

Problem:
- Most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers with manually crafted prompts specifying rules and behaviors. This limits their ability to handle complex, dynamic tasks like large multiplayer games.

- Humans can learn and adapt behaviors through interaction, especially in novel scenarios. The paper explores if LLM agents can also learn and improve strategies by interacting with environments.

Method: 
- Proposes Agent-Pro, an LLM-based agent framework that can self-learn and evolve behavioral policies through interaction. 

- Uses a belief-aware decision process to build dynamic self- and world- beliefs, enabling more rational actions.

- Employs policy-level reflection to examine and update prompt instructions based on past trajectories and beliefs. Summarizes key learnings into behavioral guidelines and world modeling.

- Optimizes policies via DFS search to continually enhance payoffs.

Contributions:
- Introduces a novel paradigm for designing evolvable LLM-based agents that can efficiently adapt to complex, dynamic tasks.

- Devises belief-aware decision making to handle uncertainty in multiplayer games.

- Utilizes policy-level reflection and optimization to progressively evolve better behavioral strategies without human guidance.

- Evaluates in Blackjack and Texas Hold'em games. Agent-Pro defeats specialized models, developing advanced skills like bluffing and disguising.

- Shows promise for enhancing LLM agent effectiveness in real-world interactive scenarios like negotiations and security.

In summary, the paper presents Agent-Pro, an innovative evolvable agent architecture that enables LLMs to start from simple prompts and autonomously learn complex behaviors purely from environment interaction. This expands their capability boundaries notably.
