# [Agent-Pro: Learning to Evolve via Policy-Level Reflection and   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17574)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Agent-Pro: Learning to Evolve via Policy-Level Reflection and Optimization":

Problem:
- Most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers with manually crafted prompts specifying rules and behaviors. This limits their ability to handle complex, dynamic tasks like large multiplayer games.

- Humans can learn and adapt behaviors through interaction, especially in novel scenarios. The paper explores if LLM agents can also learn and improve strategies by interacting with environments.

Method: 
- Proposes Agent-Pro, an LLM-based agent framework that can self-learn and evolve behavioral policies through interaction. 

- Uses a belief-aware decision process to build dynamic self- and world- beliefs, enabling more rational actions.

- Employs policy-level reflection to examine and update prompt instructions based on past trajectories and beliefs. Summarizes key learnings into behavioral guidelines and world modeling.

- Optimizes policies via DFS search to continually enhance payoffs.

Contributions:
- Introduces a novel paradigm for designing evolvable LLM-based agents that can efficiently adapt to complex, dynamic tasks.

- Devises belief-aware decision making to handle uncertainty in multiplayer games.

- Utilizes policy-level reflection and optimization to progressively evolve better behavioral strategies without human guidance.

- Evaluates in Blackjack and Texas Hold'em games. Agent-Pro defeats specialized models, developing advanced skills like bluffing and disguising.

- Shows promise for enhancing LLM agent effectiveness in real-world interactive scenarios like negotiations and security.

In summary, the paper presents Agent-Pro, an innovative evolvable agent architecture that enables LLMs to start from simple prompts and autonomously learn complex behaviors purely from environment interaction. This expands their capability boundaries notably.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Agent-Pro, an LLM-based agent framework capable of self-learning and evolving behavioral strategies through policy-level reflection and optimization in complex interactive games.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Agent-Pro, an LLM-based agent framework that can learn and evolve its behavioral policy through interaction with the environment. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. It introduces a belief-aware decision-making process to construct dynamic beliefs about the world and itself, enabling more rational actions in complex interactive scenarios. 

2. It proposes a policy-level reflection mechanism to examine and calibrate the rationality of beliefs from past experiences. The reflections are then summarized as behavioral guidelines and world modeling to update the policy.

3. It employs a DFS-based search algorithm to progressively optimize the policy for better payoffs based on policy evaluation. 

4. Experiments in two multi-player games with imperfect information demonstrate that Agent-Pro can defeat strong baselines and learn advanced techniques like bluffing, risk assessment, etc. after self-evolution.

In summary, this work explores a promising direction of designing LLM-based agents that can learn from interactions and progressively enhance their behavioral strategies like humans, expanding their capability boundaries. The proposed techniques contribute to building more versatile and adaptive LLM-based agents.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- Agent-Pro - The name of the proposed framework for an LLM-based agent capable of self-learning and evolving through policy-level reflection and optimization.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The foundation of the Agent-Pro framework. LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2-70B are used to build the agent.

- Imperfect information games - The interactive environments used to evaluate Agent-Pro, specifically multi-player card games like Blackjack and Texas Hold'em poker with imperfect information.  

- Belief-aware decision making - Agent-Pro constructs dynamic beliefs about itself and the world which inform its decision making.

- Policy-level reflection - Unlike action-level reflection, Agent-Pro reflects on entire trajectories and beliefs to evolve better behavioral policies. 

- Prompt optimization - The policy learning process is framed as optimizing the prompt's instructions through self-reflection.

- Depth-first search - Used to iteratively search for better policy prompts during the optimization process.

- Zero-sum games - Both Blackjack and Texas Hold'em poker are zero-sum games used to demonstrate Agent-Pro's ability to learn complex strategies.

In summary, the key focus is on designing LLMs agents capable of autonomous learning and policy improvement through interaction, facilitated via prompt optimization and reflection.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a belief-aware decision-making process to simulate human cognitive processes using self-belief and world-belief. How does constructing these dynamic beliefs specifically help the agent make more rational decisions in complex, imperfect information games?

2. The policy-level reflection process focuses on reflecting on entire trajectories rather than individual actions. Explain why this is more suitable for complex interactive tasks with delayed feedback compared to action-level reflection strategies.  

3. When reflecting on failed trajectories, the agent examines the rationality of its beliefs on three main dimensions - correctness, consistency, and rationality. Elaborate on each of these dimensions and how assessing them can help calibrate incorrect beliefs.

4. The paper summarizes the reflections on erroneous beliefs into Behavioral Guidelines and World Modeling instructions that are incorporated back into the prompt. Explain the specific purpose and expected benefits of each of these instruction types for policy improvement.

5. The DFS-based policy search method iteratively explores branches to find better policies. Why is directly assessing performance improvement on the same "training" trajectories not sufficient for ensuring generalizability of the new policy? 

6. Analyze the differences in learned strategies between Agent-Pro versions based on different foundation models (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 vs Llama-2) as observed in the learning curves in Figure 3. What inferences can be made about the impact of the foundation model on emergent strategies?

7. The paper evaluates Agent-Pro on two games - Blackjack and Texas Hold'em Poker. Analyze the different complexities and challenges posed by each game environment to evaluate an agent's capabilities.

8. The case studies for Blackjack highlight differences in risk-taking behaviors between Agent-Pro and baseline agents in handling uncertainty about the dealer's cards. Further analyze such behaviors exhibited in the provided examples.

9. The Texas Hold'em case studies depict how Agent-Pro's strategy evolves from the early learning phase to after learning. Elaborate on the specific improvements observed in its understanding of the game, rationality of beliefs, and flexibility of actions.

10. The paper focuses on using policy optimization for open-ended improvement of behaviors in complex environments. Discuss other potential applications, tasks, or scenarios where this approach could be beneficial for developing more capable LLM-based agents.
