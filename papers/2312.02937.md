# [Synergistic Perception and Control Simplex for Verifiable Safe Vertical   Landing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02937)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a verifiable solution for safe vertical landing of autonomous aerial vehicles in cluttered environments. It utilizes a Perception Simplex architecture with a high-performance but unverifiable mission layer for autonomy along with a high-assurance safety layer for reliable collision avoidance. The key innovation is replacing static conservative assumptions about vehicle control capabilities, like maximum deceleration, with dynamic confirmation of these capabilities in real-time from the low-level controller. This allows the safety constraints and fail-safe maneuvers to match the actual vehicle capabilities more closely over time while retaining verifiability. The paper details the system design across perception, control, and decision components along with their interactions. Through software-in-the-loop simulation, the system is shown to enable up to 1.5x faster landing time while guaranteeing collision avoidance and system safety compared to using static assumptions. Overall, the synergistic integration of verifiable perception and adaptive control enables high-performance autonomy with reliability guarantees.
