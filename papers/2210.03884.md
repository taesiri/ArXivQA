# Don't Lose Yourself! Empathetic Response Generation via Explicit   Self-Other Awareness

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we generate more empathetic conversational responses by modeling explicit self-other awareness? The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling and maintaining separate representations for self-awareness and other-awareness will allow an empathetic dialogue system to generate responses that are more empathetic. In particular, the paper proposes that empathy requires:1) Differentiating between one's own emotional state (self-awareness) and the emotional state of the other conversant (other-awareness)2) Dynamically modulating the contribution of self-vs-other awareness during the generation process 3) Explicitly conditioning response generation on representations of both self-awareness and other-awarenessBy implementing these capabilities in a model called EmpSOA, the authors aim to test their hypothesis that explicit self-other awareness leads to increased empathy in generated conversational responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a new model called EmpSOA (Empathetic response with explicit Self-Other Awareness) for empathetic response generation. - It introduces the concepts of self-awareness and other-awareness from psychology/cognitive science into empathetic dialogue systems. The key idea is to explicitly model and differentiate between the emotional/cognitive states of self and other during empathetic response generation.- It devises three novel stages - Self-Other Differentiation (SOD), Self-Other Modulation (SOM), and Self-Other Generation (SOG) - to computationally achieve self-other awareness in empathetic response generation.- SOD uses graph attention to separately model self-awareness and other-awareness. SOM controls the contribution of self vs other awareness. SOG injects self-other awareness into decoding.- Experiments on the EmpatheticDialogues dataset demonstrate EmpSOA generates more empathetic responses than prior state-of-the-art methods, based on both automatic metrics and human evaluation.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new empathetic dialogue model to explicitly incorporate self-other awareness, which is an important psychological aspect of empathy, leading to improved empathetic response generation. The idea of differentiating and controlling self vs other perspective is novel in this application area.
