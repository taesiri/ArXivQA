# Don't Lose Yourself! Empathetic Response Generation via Explicit   Self-Other Awareness

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we generate more empathetic conversational responses by modeling explicit self-other awareness? The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling and maintaining separate representations for self-awareness and other-awareness will allow an empathetic dialogue system to generate responses that are more empathetic. In particular, the paper proposes that empathy requires:1) Differentiating between one's own emotional state (self-awareness) and the emotional state of the other conversant (other-awareness)2) Dynamically modulating the contribution of self-vs-other awareness during the generation process 3) Explicitly conditioning response generation on representations of both self-awareness and other-awarenessBy implementing these capabilities in a model called EmpSOA, the authors aim to test their hypothesis that explicit self-other awareness leads to increased empathy in generated conversational responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a new model called EmpSOA (Empathetic response with explicit Self-Other Awareness) for empathetic response generation. - It introduces the concepts of self-awareness and other-awareness from psychology/cognitive science into empathetic dialogue systems. The key idea is to explicitly model and differentiate between the emotional/cognitive states of self and other during empathetic response generation.- It devises three novel stages - Self-Other Differentiation (SOD), Self-Other Modulation (SOM), and Self-Other Generation (SOG) - to computationally achieve self-other awareness in empathetic response generation.- SOD uses graph attention to separately model self-awareness and other-awareness. SOM controls the contribution of self vs other awareness. SOG injects self-other awareness into decoding.- Experiments on the EmpatheticDialogues dataset demonstrate EmpSOA generates more empathetic responses than prior state-of-the-art methods, based on both automatic metrics and human evaluation.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new empathetic dialogue model to explicitly incorporate self-other awareness, which is an important psychological aspect of empathy, leading to improved empathetic response generation. The idea of differentiating and controlling self vs other perspective is novel in this application area.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new model called EmpSOA that generates more empathetic responses in conversations by explicitly maintaining and incorporating both self-awareness and other-awareness representations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on empathetic response generation compares to other related work:- It proposes a novel model called EmpSOA that incorporates explicit self-other awareness into the process of generating empathetic responses. Most prior work has focused only on perceiving the other's emotions/situation, without considering the self's perspective. - The model has distinct modules for self-other differentiation, modulation, and generation. This allows for disentangling, controlling, and injecting self-other aware representations at different stages. Other models typically don't have this kind of modular design.- It leverages commonsense knowledge from COMET to capture fine-grained emotional and cognitive states of both self and other. This provides a richer understanding than just relying on the dialogue context.- The methodology includes both automatic metrics and human evaluations to assess quality, empathy, coherence, etc. Many papers rely only on automatic metrics like BLEU which are not ideal for dialogue.- Experiments demonstrate EmpSOA generates more empathetic, relevant, and informative responses compared to state-of-the-art models like MoEL, MIME, EmpDG, etc.- Analyses shed light on the impact of different model components and the importance of joint self-other awareness vs. just self or other alone.Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to empathetic dialogue research by proposing a new model architecture guided by theories of empathy and self-other awareness from psychology. The rigorous experiments and analyses provide insights into improving empathetic response generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring the theory of self-other awareness in tasks specifically aimed at eliciting positive emotions from the other conversant. The current work focuses on empathy, but the authors suggest applying self-other awareness to optimize systems for uplifting emotions as well.- Testing the approach over longer conversations, to see if self-other awareness can be maintained effectively over extended interactions. The current datasets have relatively short contexts.- Incorporating higher quality commonsense knowledge to better capture self-other representations. The authors used ATOMIC, but suggest exploring other knowledge bases. - Developing better automatic evaluation metrics for empathetic dialogue systems. Existing metrics like BLEU have limitations, so new metrics need to be designed to properly assess empathy.- Addressing several limitations of the current work, including the short context length in the dataset, the quality of commonsense knowledge, and the need for better empathy evaluation metrics.In summary, the main suggestions are to test the approach in other scenarios focused on positivity, evaluate it over longer conversations, integrate better knowledge bases, and invent new metrics to measure empathetic ability. Improving the self-other awareness modeling itself is also noted as an area for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new model called EmpSOA for empathetic response generation in dialog systems. The key idea is to explicitly model self-other awareness during response generation, which is important for conveying genuine empathy. The model has three main components: 1) Self-Other Differentiation (SOD) which maintains separate representations for self and other awareness using heterogeneous graphs, 2) Self-Other Modulation (SOM) which dynamically controls the contributions of self vs other awareness, and 3) Self-Other Generation (SOG) which injects the self-other representations into the decoder to generate the response. Experiments on the EmpatheticDialogues benchmark dataset show EmpSOA generates more empathetic responses than previous state-of-the-art methods, as measured by both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The main conclusion is that explicitly modeling self vs other perspective is important for empathy and can improve empathetic response generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new model called EmpSOA for empathetic response generation in dialog systems. The key idea is to incorporate explicit self-other awareness into the model to generate more empathetic responses. The model has three main components. First, the Self-Other Differentiation module maintains separate representations for self-awareness and other-awareness using heterogeneous graphs. This allows disentangling the emotional states of self and other. Second, the Self-Other Modulation module controls the contribution of the self and other representations. Third, the Self-Other Generation module injects the self and other representations into the decoder to generate the response grounded in both perspectives. Experiments on the EmpatheticDialogues dataset demonstrate EmpSOA generates more empathetic, relevant, and informative responses compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Analysis shows all three components contribute to the improved performance. The explicit modeling of self-other awareness is critical for empathetic response generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel model called EmpSOA for empathetic response generation via explicit self-other awareness. The key idea is to clearly differentiate and maintain the self-awareness and other-awareness during the generation process. The model has three main stages:1) Self-Other Differentiation (SOD): Constructs two heterogeneous graphs to represent self-awareness and other-awareness respectively. The graphs contain utterance nodes, emotional/cognitive commonsense knowledge nodes from COMET, and emotional/cognitive state nodes. Graph attention is applied to update the node representations. 2) Self-Other Modulation (SOM): Dynamically fuses the emotional and cognitive representations into self-awareness and other-awareness representations. Uses cross-attention to modulate the contribution of self-other aware context. 3) Self-Other Generation (SOG): Injects the self-awareness and other-awareness into the decoder during response generation through gating and fusion with the decoder hidden states.In summary, the key method is to explicitly maintain, regulate and utilize the self-other aware representations throughout the empathetic response generation process via the three stages of SOD, SOM and SOG. This allows generating responses grounded in both the perceptions of self and others.
