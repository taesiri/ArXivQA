# [LIGHTCODE: Light Analytical and Neural Codes for Channels with Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10751)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper focuses on designing efficient and interpretable coding schemes for channels with feedback. Feedback channels, where the receiver sends information back to the transmitter, can help improve reliability of communication. However, designing codes that fully utilize feedback is challenging. 

The paper first reviews classical analytical coding schemes like the Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) scheme and the Gallager-Nakiboglu (GN) scheme. These schemes provide good reliability but have limitations in complexity and performance, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

The paper then proposes a new analytical scheme called PowerBlast that combines ideas from SK and GN. PowerBlast outperforms both SK and GN across a range of coding rates and SNRs. However, its performance is still limited at very low SNRs.

Recently, deep learning based codes have shown great promise in improving reliability for channels with feedback. But these codes can be complex and not interpretable. This paper proposes DeepCode, a lightweight neural network based code that uses 10x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art schemes like GBAF. Surprisingly, DeepCode matches or exceeds the performance of GBAF across a range of rates, even though it uses symbol-by-symbol coding instead of complex block coding. 

The paper shows how DeepCode automatically learns to allocate more power to symbols with errors, similar to the PowerBlast scheme. Detailed analysis reveals DeepCode learns highly non-linear mappings in later communication rounds. This explains why neural network based schemes outperform analytical schemes at low SNRs.

In summary, the key contributions are:
1) PowerBlast, a new analytical scheme that outperforms SK and GN
2) DeepCode, an efficient neural code with 10x fewer parameters that exceeds state-of-the-art performance 
3) Analysis showing how DeepCode resembles PowerBlast and learns non-linear mappings that enable better performance at low SNRs

The schemes strike an excellent balance between performance, efficiency and interpretability for coding with feedback.
