# [Training Models to Generate, Recognize, and Reframe Unhelpful Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02768)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goals appear to be:1) To create a novel dataset (\textsc{PatternReframe}) of unhelpful thoughts exhibiting common cognitive distortions/unhelpful thinking patterns, along with corresponding reframed versions. The thoughts are conditioned on personas for contextual grounding.2) To introduce controllable text generation tasks using this dataset - generating unhelpful thoughts for a given persona and thought pattern, and reframing unhelpful thoughts while preserving meaning and persona context.  3) To train and evaluate different natural language processing models, based on fine-tuning and few-shot learning, on the tasks of generating, identifying, and reframing unhelpful thoughts using the proposed dataset.So in summary, the central research questions seem to be:- Can we create a high-quality dataset of personalized unhelpful thoughts and reframings that captures diverse examples of common thought distortions?- How well can current state-of-the-art NLP models perform on conditional generation tasks using this dataset, with minimal additional training?- Can models leverage this dataset to produce abundant and tailored practice material for learning cognitive reframing techniques?The key hypothesis appears to be that existing large language models can already generate and reframe unhelpful thoughts in a personalized, controllable way, given a small specialized dataset like the one proposed. The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through empirical experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new dataset, PatternReframe, for generating, identifying, and reframing unhelpful thoughts. The key points are:- PatternReframe contains around 10k examples of thoughts exhibiting 10 common unhelpful thinking patterns, conditioned on personas. It also contains around 27k rewrites of those thoughts that reframe them in a more positive/helpful way. - The dataset was collected via a multi-step crowdsourcing process to generate the unhelpful thoughts based on personas and thought patterns, categorize the thoughts, rewrite them in a more positive way, and evaluate the rewrites.- The authors introduce tasks for generating, classifying, and reframing unhelpful thoughts conditioned on a persona using this new dataset. They train and evaluate several neural network models on these tasks.- Their results show that current state-of-the-art models can already generate, recognize, and reframe unhelpful thoughts reasonably well, even with minimal training data. The best performing model was GPT-3.5 which could generate and reframe very fluently through few-shot prompting.- By releasing this dataset and benchmarking models, the authors hope to provide tools to generate ample personalized practice material for cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. This could help address the lack of diverse, specific examples when teaching these techniques.In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and benchmarking of a new dataset and tasks for generating, recognizing, and reframing unhelpful thoughts using neural network models. This could enable generating ample personalized practice material for CBT techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper: The paper introduces a new dataset of about 10k examples of thoughts exhibiting common unhelpful thinking patterns, matched with positive reframes, and shows that current language models can already generate, identify, and reframe such thoughts when conditioned on a persona.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of training models for generating, recognizing, and reframing unhelpful thoughts:- This paper introduces a new dataset called PatternReframe for generating, identifying, and reframing unhelpful thoughts conditioned on personas. This is the first dataset focused specifically on reframing common unhelpful thinking patterns from CBT using personas as context. Previous datasets have focused on reframing stressful tweets or therapist-client conversations, but without the personas or specific CBT thought patterns.- The paper shows that current state-of-the-art models like BART, T5, R2C2, and especially GPT-3.5 can generate, classify, and reframe unhelpful thoughts when trained on this new dataset. Previous work has focused more on classifying unhelpful thoughts, but not generating or reframing them. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using models for all three tasks.- The results show GPT-3.5 performs remarkably well on the tasks with just prompting, outperforming fine-tuned models. This highlights the power of few-shot learning, whereas most prior work has relied on fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets.- For evaluation, the paper introduces comprehensive automatic metrics and human evaluations. Prior work has relied more on just automatic metrics. The human evals here provide better insight into quality of generations.- The conditioning on personas and thought patterns makes the dataset more diverse and grounded compared to previous generic datasets. This will likely enable future work to generate more robust, personalized practice material for cognitive reframing techniques.In summary, the key novelties are the persona-grounded dataset for unhelpful thoughts, demonstrations of feasibility of generation/reframing by models, and introducing few-shot approaches like GPT-3.5, which enable these tasks without needing large domain-specific datasets.
