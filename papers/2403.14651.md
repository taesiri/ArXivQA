# [DOSA: A Dataset of Social Artifacts from Different Indian Geographical   Subcultures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14651)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being used in various applications globally, so they need to be aware of local socio-cultural contexts. However, LLMs are predominantly trained on web data which underrepresents many cultures.
- There is a lack of robust evaluation datasets to assess the cultural awareness and alignment of LLMs with respect to the commonplace knowledge held by members of different cultures. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a community-centered participatory research approach to create a dataset of social artifacts across 19 regional subcultures of India. 
- 260 participants engaged in surveys and a gamified framework to collectively make sense of and describe 615 social artifacts that have significance in their respective cultures.

Main Contributions:
- First participatory research based dataset created through community involvement to evaluate cultural familiarity of LLMs
- Benchmarking of GPT-4, Llama2, PALM 2 and FALCON on inference of social artifacts shows significant variation across Indian regional subcultures
- Analysis of obstacles in participatory research for dataset creation and guidelines for effective community member engagement
- Demonstrates how technology evaluation benefits from integrating community intelligence through participatory research

In summary, this paper makes a case for more community-centered research in AI using participatory methods for dataset creation. It offers an exemplar participatory framework for evaluating LLMs' encoding of the commonplace cultural knowledge held by members of different geographic subcultures within India.
