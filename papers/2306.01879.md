# [VisualGPTScore: Visio-Linguistic Reasoning with Multimodal Generative   Pre-Training Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01879)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can multimodal generative pre-training scores, such as the likelihood of text given an image, outperform discriminative scores on benchmarks designed to test for compositional visio-linguistic reasoning?The key hypothesis appears to be that generative pre-training scores, such as VisualGPTScore which models the conditional likelihood P(text|image), will demonstrate stronger compositional reasoning abilities compared to mainstream discriminative scores used by most vision-language models. The paper challenges the prevailing view that vision-language models are "bag-of-words" models that lack compositional understanding. It tests this hypothesis by evaluating VisualGPTScore on several recent benchmarks like ARO, Crepe, and Winoground that are designed to assess compositional reasoning. The paper also proposes an information-theoretic factorization of VisualGPTScore to diagnose issues in existing benchmarks and debias results.In summary, the central research question is whether generative pre-training scores can outperform discriminative scores on compositional reasoning benchmarks, in order to demonstrate that vision-language models have greater compositional capacities than commonly believed. The key hypothesis is that modeling the conditional likelihood P(text|image) will lead to stronger compositional reasoning compared to discriminative matching objectives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting Visual Generative Pre-Training Score (VisualGPTScore), a generative scoring method for image-text retrieval tasks that demonstrates strong performance on compositional reasoning benchmarks. The key points are:- VisualGPTScore is based on the likelihood score of a text conditioned on an image from an image-conditioned language model. It significantly outperforms prior discriminative methods like CLIP on compositional reasoning benchmarks.- The paper factorizes VisualGPTScore into marginal text probability and pointwise mutual information (PMI). This allows diagnosing language bias in datasets and debiasing on retrieval tasks.- VisualGPTScore provides insights about evaluating visio-linguistic compositionality. The authors argue that balanced datasets like Winoground are better benchmarks than adversarial datasets like ARO, since the latter can be partially solved without looking at images.- The information-theoretic factorization framework helps expose issues like dataset bias. It also improves results on Winoground and retrieval tasks through tunable debiasing.In summary, the key contribution is presenting VisualGPTScore, a multimodal generative scoring method that challenges the notion that VLMs lack compositional understanding. The factorization framework also provides insights into benchmarking visio-linguistic reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading, here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes using the generative visual language model score from BLIP as a retrieval metric, showing it outperforms discriminative CLIP scores on compositional reasoning benchmarks and also allows diagnosing dataset bias through an information-theoretic factorization into marginal text probability and pointwise mutual information components.
