# [Large Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Zero-Shot   Disease Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06457)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for identifying disease phenotypes from electronic health records using large language models with a retrieval-augmented generation approach. The method involves first retrieving relevant snippets of clinical notes for a patient using regular expressions. These snippets are then fed in parallel into a large language model called PaLM-2 using a MapReduce approach. The model diagnoses each snippet, and the diagnoses are aggregated to determine an overall diagnosis for the patient. This method is applied to identify patients with pulmonary hypertension, a rare disease, and significantly outperforms a rules-based algorithm developed by a physician expert (F1 score of 0.75 vs 0.62). The paper demonstrates the potential of large language models to effectively process real-world clinical documentation at scale to phenotype diseases. Key innovations include the retrieval-augmentation to select relevant texts, the MapReduce approach to handle long notes, and the zero-shot prompting of the large language model to make diagnoses without training data. Future work is proposed to integrate this approach with structured EHR data, explore other language models, and apply it to additional clinical use cases.
