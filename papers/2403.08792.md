## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Facial expression recognition (FER) is important for applications like social robotics but requires real-time operation which is challenging on resource/energy constrained edge devices.
- There is a need to develop specialized machine learning models tailored for edge devices.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use automated ML to optimize convolutional neural network (CNN) models for 4 edge AI accelerators: Raspberry Pi, Intel NCS, Nvidia Jetson Nano, and Google Coral TPU.
- Convert the CNNs to equivalent spiking neural networks (SNNs) to run on the Intel Loihi neuromorphic processor.  
- Compare performance of Loihi and edge accelerators in terms of accuracy, latency, power, energy.

Key Contributions:
- Developed optimized CNN models for edge devices using neural architecture search. 
- Converted CNNs to SNNs and enhanced performance using edge detection as input pre-processing. This increased accuracy and reduced power/energy of SNNs.
- Experimental comparison showed Loihi achieved ~100x power and ~10x energy reduction over edge accelerators with comparable accuracy. 
- Loihi met real-time requirements (>28 FPS) despite higher latency than edge devices.
- Showed promise of neuromorphic hardware like Loihi for low-power, real-time FER at the edge.

In summary, the paper leverages automated ML to tailor FER models for edge devices and shows neuromorphic hardware can provide significant power/energy benefits while meeting real-time needs. The comparisons highlight key trade-offs between edge AI accelerators and neuromorphic solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops facial expression recognition models optimized for edge devices and compares the performance of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware against convolutional neural networks on edge AI accelerators, finding much lower power and energy usage with the neuromorphic processor while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a comparative analysis between deploying facial expression recognition models on neuromorphic hardware (Intel Loihi) versus edge AI accelerators (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, Intel NCS, and Coral TPU). Specifically:

- The paper develops CNN models optimized for each edge device using automated machine learning techniques. These models are then converted to equivalent spiking neural networks for deployment on Loihi.

- Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate accuracy, latency, power dissipation, and energy consumption of the facial expression recognition task on both Loihi and the edge AI accelerators. 

- The key findings show Loihi can achieve about 100x better power efficiency and 10x better energy efficiency compared to the edge accelerators, while maintaining similar accuracy levels and meeting real-time latency requirements.

- The paper also investigates the impact of increasing input sparsity on Loihi through edge detection. This is found to further reduce power and improve accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is a thorough benchmarking of neuromorphic hardware against state-of-the-art edge AI accelerators for a practical facial expression recognition application, providing insights into the trade-offs and advantages of the different platforms.
