# [Stochastic contextual bandits with graph feedback: from independence   number to MAS number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies stochastic contextual bandits with graph feedback, where taking an action reveals rewards of neighboring actions in a feedback graph under all contexts. The goal is to characterize the fundamental limit on the regret, which depends on both the number of contexts M and the feedback graph structure G. 

Prior Work: 
For multi-armed bandits (single context), tight regret bounds in terms of the independence number α(G) or MAS number mas(G) are known. For contextual bandits, only upper bounds in terms of mas(G) are known, with gaps in understanding the dependence on M and whether mas(G) is necessary.

Key Contributions:

1) Proposes a new graph quantity β_M(G) that depends on both M and G, and shows it characterizes the fundamental regret limit with a tight lower bound Ω(√β_M(G)T).

2) Shows that as M increases, β_M(G) interpolates between α(G) and mas(G), indicating that mas(G) is necessary for large M unlike the multi-armed case. 

3) Provides polynomial-time algorithms that achieve near optimal regrets for self-avoiding context sequences, using sequential graph exploration games. For general contexts, shows an upper bound with a gap compared to the lower bound.

4) Establishes tight results for important graph classes like undirected or transitively closed graphs, with applications to auction and inventory control problems exhibiting such feedback structures.

In summary, the paper significantly advances the understanding of fundamental limits of learning in stochastic contextual bandits under graph feedback, through a sophisticated analysis relating regret minimization to new sequential graph exploration games. The dependence of the limits on both M and G are characterized precisely for the first time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies stochastic contextual bandits with graph feedback, establishes a minimax lower bound that depends on a new graph-theoretic quantity interpolating between the independence number and MAS number, and provides algorithms achieving near-optimal regret for various classes of context sequences and feedback graphs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It establishes a new minimax lower bound on the regret for stochastic contextual bandits with graph feedback, characterized by the graph-theoretic quantity $\beta_M(G)$. This quantity interpolates between the independence number $\alpha(G)$ and the maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS) number $\mas(G)$ as the number of contexts $M$ varies. In particular, the paper shows that with many contexts, the MAS number completely characterizes the fundamental statistical complexity.

2) For self-avoiding context sequences, the paper provides an algorithm that achieves the near-optimal regret scaling as $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\beta_M(G) T})$. 

3) For general context sequences, the paper gives an algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\min\{\overline{\beta}_M(G), \mas(G)\} T})$ regret, which is near-optimal for undirected or transitively closed graphs.

4) The analysis introduces two new sequential games on graphs that abstract the key difficulties in exploration under self-avoiding vs general context sequences. Tight (or nearly tight) minimax values are derived for these games.

In summary, the paper significantly advances our understanding of fundamental limits and optimal algorithms for contextual bandits with graph feedback structure. The results demonstrate an intriguing dependence on the number of contexts $M$, and establish the maximum acyclic subgraph number as the key quantity characterizing the statistical complexity when $M$ is large.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Contextual bandits: The paper studies stochastic contextual bandits, which is a class of interactive learning problems where the learner sequentially makes decisions based on contexts.

- Graph feedback: The paper assumes additional feedback structure modeled as a directed feedback graph, where an edge $u\to v$ indicates that taking action $u$ reveals the reward for action $v$.  

- Minimax regret: The paper aims to characterize the minimax regret, which measures the worst-case regret over contexts, mean rewards, and policies.

- Independence number: An important graph measure that arises is the independence number $\alpha(G)$, which equals the minimax regret when there is only one context.

- MAS number: Another graph measure is the maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS) number $\mas(G)$, which provides regret upper bounds when there are multiple contexts.

- $\beta_M(G)$: A key quantity introduced in the paper that lower bounds the minimax regret and interpolates between $\alpha(G)$ and $\mas(G)$.

- Self-avoiding contexts: A class of context sequences studied where contexts do not jump back, for which tight regret bounds are provided.

- Sequential games: The proofs construct two sequential games on graphs that embed the exploration challenge, by reductions to regret upper bounds.

In summary, the key focus is understanding how graph feedback and multiple contexts together determine the fundamental limits of learning in contextual bandits.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper introduces a new graph-theoretic quantity $\beta_M(G)$ that depends on both the feedback graph $G$ and the number of contexts $M$. How does this quantity interpolate between the independence number $\alpha(G)$ and the MAS number $\mas(G)$? What is the intuition behind this interpolation?

2) The paper shows that with enough contexts, the MAS number completely characterizes the statistical complexity, rather than the independence number which characterizes the multi-armed bandit setting. What is the intuition behind this shift from independence number to MAS number as the number of contexts increases? 

3) The proof of the lower bound constructs a hard instance using disjoint independent sets $I_1,\ldots,I_M$ such that $I_i \not\to I_j$ for $i<j$. Why is this construction crucial? How does it exploit the increasing number of contexts?

4) For self-avoiding contexts, the upper bound is achieved by reducing the learning problem to a sequential game on the graph. What is the intuition behind this reduction and the design of the sequential game? 

5) For general contexts, there is a gap between the upper and lower bounds in terms of the graph quantities. Where does this gap stem from and what are the challenges in closing it?

6) The upper bounds are achieved via arm elimination algorithms that incorporate the sequential games. Walk through the details of how these algorithms exploit the feedback graph structure using layering and confident bounds. 

7) Transitively closed graphs play an important role in applications like auctions and inventory control. Explain why the upper and lower bounds match for these graphs. What property makes them more amenable to analysis?

8) Compare the regret bounds in this paper to prior work on contextual bandits with graph feedback. What improvements are achieved and what open problems still remain?

9) The minimax values of the sequential games do not have fully tight characterizations. What are some examples that illustrate the challenges in analyzing these games? 

10) For non-self-avoiding contexts, the lower bound proof assumes the adversary reveals all plays upfront. Why is the sequential structure still important here? How might a sequential argument be formulated?
