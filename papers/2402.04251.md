# [Linear-time Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding with Reference Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has been shown to improve machine translation quality over beam search, but requires sampling many hypotheses and computing pairwise metric scores between hypotheses and references. This quadratic complexity is computationally expensive and limits practical application.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose "reference aggregation", where representations of multiple reference translations are averaged into a single aggregate reference. Metric scores of hypotheses are then computed against this aggregate reference instead of each individual reference.

- This reduces complexity from O(n^2) to O(n+m) where n is number of hypotheses and m is number of references. Computation time is reduced while preserving most of quality gain of MBR.

Main Contributions:
- Formalize reference aggregation for chrF and COMET metrics, showing it is exact for chrF and an approximation for the neural COMET.

- Empirically demonstrate 99.5% speedup for chrF and 95-99% for COMET with minimal impact on translation quality across 4 translation directions. Total translation time reduced by 73-79%.

- Propose "aggregate-to-fine MBR" which uses aggregation to prune hypotheses then applies standard MBR on pruned set. Preserves quality better while still providing 73-77% speedup.

- Overall, reference aggregation successfully boosts efficiency of MBR decoding, narrowing the gap to beam search while keeping most of the quality gains. Makes MBR more viable for large-scale machine translation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient approach for minimum Bayes risk decoding that aggregates reference representations to reduce the computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a technique called "reference aggregation" to reduce the computational complexity of minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding from quadratic to linear in the number of hypotheses. 

Specifically, the paper proposes to approximate the pairwise metric scores used in MBR decoding with scores calculated against an aggregated reference representation. This aggregated reference is created by averaging embeddings or n-gram counts across multiple reference translations. By comparing each hypothesis to this single aggregated reference instead of multiple individual references, the complexity is reduced from O(n^2) to O(n).

The paper shows empirically that reference aggregation speeds up MBR decoding by 95-99% for the chrF and COMET metrics, while preserving most of the quality gains compared to beam search. It makes MBR decoding much more efficient and practical for large-scale applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes approximating pairwise metric scores with scores calculated against aggregated reference representations. Can you explain in more detail how the aggregate reference representation is created and used to estimate utility?

2. Reference aggregation changes the complexity of utility estimation from O(n^2) to O(n). Walk through the complexity analysis and explain why reference aggregation achieves linear complexity. 

3. For ChrF, reference aggregation entails a slight modification of the metric definition but is otherwise exact. Explain what modification is made to the ChrF metric when using reference aggregation.

4. For Comet, reference aggregation involves averaging sentence embeddings. What potential issues could this cause in terms of metric accuracy and how did the authors evaluate this empirically?

5. The authors propose an "aggregate-to-fine" MBR approach, analogous to coarse-to-fine MBR. Explain how this approach works and why it may have lower loss of quality compared to just using reference aggregation.

6. In the validation experiments, reference aggregation with ChrF maintains near perfect top-20 accuracy even with just a single aggregate reference. Why does ChrF see such little degradation compared to Comet?

7. While reference aggregation substantially reduces computation time, the cost of sampling becomes the dominant factor. Suggest one approach the authors could have used to also improve sampling efficiency.

8. How exactly does partial aggregation work? Explain the idea and how it allows the authors to study the accuracy impact of using varying numbers of effective references.

9. One limitation stated is that reference aggregation requires a utility metric based on averageable representations. Suggest one common utility metric that does NOT satisfy this criteria and explain why. 

10. If you were to extend this work, what is one key research question you would want to address regarding the proposed method?
