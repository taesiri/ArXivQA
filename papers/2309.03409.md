# [Large Language Models as Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can large language models be utilized as optimizers, where the optimization process is described and guided through natural language prompting? Specifically, the authors propose an approach called "Optimization by PROmpting" (OPRO) to leverage the natural language understanding and text generation capabilities of large language models to iteratively optimize objectives simply via prompting, without requiring formal problem specification or gradient calculations. The key ideas explored are:- Using a meta-prompt with natural language instructions and past solution trajectories to guide the language model in generating new candidate solutions.- Evaluating the proposed solutions against the objective and adding them back to the meta-prompt.- Gradually improving solutions over optimization steps by allowing the language model to identify patterns and relationships from previous candidates.- Applying this prompting-based optimization approach to tasks like mathematical optimization (e.g. linear regression, TSP) and prompt engineering for maximizing accuracy of language models.In essence, the central hypothesis is that large language models can effectively serve as optimizers through natural language prompting alone, without needing explicit programming as traditional optimization algorithms require. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability across different tasks and language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. Rather than formally defining the optimization problem and deriving update steps with a programmed solver, OPRO describes the optimization task in natural language and instructs the LLM to iteratively generate new solutions. 2. Demonstrating the potential of OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems. The results show that LLMs are able to find good solutions to these classic optimization problems simply through prompting, sometimes matching or surpassing hand-designed algorithms.3. Applying OPRO to prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize task accuracy when prepended to LLM predictions. Experiments on GSM8K and Big-Bench Hard show optimized prompts can substantially outperform human-designed prompts, with gains of up to 50% on some Big-Bench tasks.4. Comprehensive evaluation of OPRO with different LLMs, including PalM 2-L, text-bison, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. The results demonstrate that various LLMs are able to serve as effective optimizers through iterative prompting.5. Analysis of optimized prompts revealing they can vary significantly in style between different LLMs, while still leading to accuracy gains. The prompts also show transferrability to related tasks.6. Ablation studies examining the effects of different meta-prompt design choices, number of solutions per step, sampling temperature, and starting points.In summary, the core contribution is introducing and demonstrating a simple yet effective approach for leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding for black-box optimization, with particularly compelling results on prompt optimization. The analysis and experiments provide valuable insights into this prompting-based optimization approach.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach for using large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. Instead of needing to formally specify the optimization problem, OPRO allows describing it in natural language. At each optimization step, the LLM generates new candidate solutions based on the problem description and previously evaluated solutions presented in the prompt. OPRO is first demonstrated on small-scale linear regression and traveling salesman problems, where LLMs can find good solutions comparable to heuristic algorithms. The paper then focuses on using OPRO for optimizing prompts on NLP tasks to maximize accuracy. Experiments on GSM8K and Big Bench Hard show optimized prompts can substantially outperform human-designed prompts, sometimes by over 50%. Different LLM optimizers produce notably different prompt styles, but all consistently improve prompts throughout optimization. Limitations include sensitivity to initial conditions and requiring a training set. Overall, the work highlights the potential of leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding for optimization.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to utilize large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. The key idea is to describe the optimization problem and previously evaluated solutions in natural language as a prompt to the LLM. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new candidate solutions based on the prompt, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next step. For example, in prompt optimization where the goal is to maximize task accuracy, the prompt contains the training set accuracy of previously generated prompts and instructions asking the LLM to generate a new prompt that improves on past ones. The authors demonstrate OPRO on linear regression, traveling salesman problems, and prompt optimization tasks. The results show LLMs are able to iteratively improve solutions and optimize prompts to outperform human-designed ones, simply through prompting.

 Unfortunately without access to the full paper text, I do not have enough context to provide a meaningful TL;DR summary or one-sentence summary. A paper's key contributions and findings are usually spread throughout the full document, so it's difficult to accurately summarize without seeing the complete work. If you are able to provide more specifics about the paper topic, contents, and results, I could try to generate a summarized version based on that additional information. But with only the instruction to summarize an unseen paper, I don't have sufficient information to produce a useful summary. Please let me know if you can give me more details about the specific paper you want summarized.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes a new method called Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) to use large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. The goal is to leverage the natural language capabilities of LLMs to perform optimization, where the optimization problem and solutions are described in text rather than formal mathematical specifications.- OPRO works by prompting the LLM with a "meta-prompt" that contains a natural language description of the optimization problem, previous solution-score pairs, and instructions/examples. The LLM then generates new candidate solutions aiming to improve the objective score. These are evaluated and added back to the meta-prompt.- The paper first demonstrates OPRO on small math problems like linear regression and traveling salesman. The LLM optimizers are able to find good solutions competitive with some heuristic algorithms.- The main application is optimizing prompts for natural language tasks, where the goal is to find a prompt that maximizes the task accuracy of a scorer LLM. Experiments on GSM8K and BigBench tasks show OPRO can substantially improve over human-designed prompts.- The paper evaluates different LLM optimizers like PaLM, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Different optimizers produce different solution styles, but all are able to serve as effective optimizers through the prompting method.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating a prompting-based framework to utilize LLMs' language capabilities for optimization, with promising results on prompt tuning and small math problems. The simple prompting interface enables using LLMs for black-box optimization without gradient access.
