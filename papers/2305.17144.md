# Ghost in the Minecraft: Generally Capable Agents for Open-World   Environments via Large Language Models with Text-based Knowledge and Memory

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop intelligent agents that are capable of functioning effectively in the open-world environment of Minecraft, mastering a wide range of challenges rather than just specialized skills?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Large language models (LLMs), leveraging their reasoning and common sense capabilities, can enable more effective goal decomposition and planning compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods when tackling complex, long-horizon tasks in Minecraft.2) By utilizing text-based knowledge and memory, LLMs can more quickly acquire and adapt skills needed to master Minecraft, offering greater learning efficiency than RL approaches.3) An LLM-based agent architecture utilizing hierarchical goal decomposition into subgoals and structured actions will allow for greater success on a broad spectrum of tasks compared to specialized RL agents focused on singular objectives like diamond collection.4) Obtaining all items in Minecraft serves as a milestone representing extensive capabilities and adaptability, on par with mastering multidisciplinary skills in the real world. Achieving this would showcase the potential of LLM-based agents as more generally capable than existing RL methods.In essence, the paper is exploring whether large language models can revolutionize the path toward generally capable agents that match or exceed human performance on a wide array of complex, open-world tasks. The Minecraft environment serves as an ideal testbed to investigate this potential.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposes a new framework called Ghost in the Minecraft (GITM) that uses large language models (LLMs) instead of traditional reinforcement learning for developing generally capable agents in Minecraft. 2. The framework includes an LLM decomposer, LLM planner, and LLM interface to hierarchically decompose goals into subgoals, structured actions, and keyboard/mouse operations. This allows leveraging the reasoning and common sense capabilities of LLMs.3. Develops structured actions with clear semantics and feedback mechanisms as an abstract interface for LLMs to interact with the environment.4. Introduces a text-based memory mechanism for LLMs to store and retrieve gained knowledge and experience, improving efficiency. 5. Demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based agent can surpass previous Minecraft agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the "ObtainDiamond" benchmark (+47.5% success rate).6. Shows that the agent can unlock the entire Minecraft overworld technology tree by obtaining all items, representing a crucial milestone towards generally capable agents.7. Proves superiority of the LLM-based approach over RL methods in terms of versatility, adaptability, and learning efficiency. The framework does not need any GPU training.In summary, the key contribution is proposing an LLM-based framework that demonstrates stronger reasoning, flexibility, and efficiency compared to prior RL-based Minecraft agents, unlocking more complex capabilities. This represents important progress towards developing generally capable agents that can handle long-horizon tasks in uncertain open-world environments.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces Ghost in the Minecraft (GITM), a novel framework that integrates large language models with text-based knowledge and memory to create capable agents for the open-world Minecraft environment, outperforming prior reinforcement learning methods on tasks like obtaining diamonds.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on developing intelligent agents for Minecraft:- Scope: This paper aims to develop a generally capable agent that can obtain all items in Minecraft Overworld. This is much more ambitious than most prior work that focuses on narrow tasks like ObtainDiamond. Unlocking the entire technology tree demonstrates a wide range of capabilities closer to human-level gameplay.- Approach: This paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) for hierarchical goal decomposition and leveraging text-based knowledge/memory. Most prior work employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to map goals directly to low-level actions, which struggles on complex tasks. Using LLMs for planning is a paradigm shift.- Performance: The proposed LLM agent significantly outperforms previous RL methods on ObtainDiamond (+47.5% success). It also unlocks the full technology tree, which RL methods have not shown. The learning efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than RL, requiring no GPU training.- Generalization: By extracting structured actions from thousands of tasks, the LLM agent shows stronger generalization than RL agents specialized for certain goals. Obtaining all items demonstrates versatility across domains.- Explainability: The LLM produces interpretable plans expressed through natural language and structured actions. This makes the agent's behavior more transparent than opaque neural network policies in RL.In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries on developing generally capable agents in Minecraft. The use of LLMs for hierarchical planning is a disruptive approach compared to standard RL techniques. The full technology tree coverage and interpretable actions are key strengths over prior work focused on RL and narrow tasks.
