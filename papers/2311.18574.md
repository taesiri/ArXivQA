# [Multi-scale Iterative Refinement towards Robust and Versatile Molecular   Docking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18574)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces DeltaDock, a robust and versatile framework for efficient molecular docking that operates in a two-step process - rapid initial complex structure sampling followed by multi-scale iterative refinement of the initial structures. A key innovation is the ligand-dependent binding site prediction model, LigPoc, which narrows down the search space using protein language models and graph neural networks. Sampled structures are then refined using a module that captures both protein-ligand atom-atom interactions and residue-atom interactions across multiple scales. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DeltaDock's superior performance over baselines in diverse docking scenarios, including improved accuracy, efficiency, generalization capabilities, and ability to predict physically valid structures. Unlike previous geometric deep learning methods strictly conditioned on blind docking, DeltaDock handles both blind and site-specific docking. With impressive docking success rates surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 20% on unseen proteins, fast runtimes, and enhanced reliability, DeltaDock stands as a robust, versatile, and promising practical tool for molecular docking critical for drug discovery.
