# [Auto-Instruct: Automatic Instruction Generation and Ranking for   Black-Box Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13127)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question of this paper is how to automatically generate and optimize natural language instructions for black-box language models, without having access to model parameters or downstream training data. 

Specifically, the paper aims to develop methods to:

1. Automatically generate a diverse set of candidate instruction prompts for a given NLP task, using only a basic task description and a few examples.

2. Effectively rank and select the best instruction prompt for each test example among the candidate prompts, without access to a validation set. 

3. Demonstrate that the automatically generated and selected prompts can outperform human-written instructions, across a variety of out-of-domain NLP tasks.

The overarching goal is to automate the instruction optimization process for black-box language models, circumventing the need for substantial manual prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning which are typically required when applying these models to new tasks under low-resource settings. The core hypothesis is that language models can be leveraged to generate high-quality instructions themselves, and effective automatic methods can be developed to select the optimal prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Auto-Instruct, an automatic approach to generate and select high-quality instructions for black-box language models. Specifically:

- They first prompt the language model to generate a diverse set of candidate instructions for a given task using different meta-prompts. This leverages the language model's own ability to produce instructions and creates a pool of candidates with varied styles and content.

- They then train an instruction ranking model on hundreds of existing NLP tasks. This model learns to predict how effective an instruction will be for a given example, based on the language model's performance when prompted by that instruction.

- At test time, the trained ranking model selects the best instruction from the candidate set for each individual example in the target task. This allows adapting the instruction to each example rather than using a single fixed one. 

- Experiments on 118 out-of-domain NLP tasks show that the auto-generated instructions selected by the ranking model outperform both human-written instructions and instructions produced by prior methods. The approach works well even without any demonstrations in the zero-shot setting.

In summary, the key innovation is developing a generate-then-rank framework to automatically create and select high-quality instructions tailored to individual examples, without human effort or access to model parameters. This greatly enhances the usability of black-box language models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of automated instruction optimization for large language models (LLMs):

- This paper introduces a novel approach called Auto-Instruct for automatically generating and ranking instructions for black-box LLMs. Most prior work in this area has focused on manually engineering prompts/instructions or optimizing them through parametric search. Auto-Instruct is the first comprehensive framework combining automated generation and ranking of instructions specifically for few-shot learning with LLMs.

- Compared to previous works on using LLMs to generate instructions like iPrompt, this paper explores more diverse meta-prompts beyond using just input-output examples. The style-specific meta-prompts lead to a more diverse set of candidate instructions. The paper also presents a training framework and data pipeline to learn an instruction ranking model, whereas prior work relied only on using a validation set.

- The scale and variety of tasks used for evaluation is much larger than in related works. Most prior studies only tested on simple tasks like arithmetic or sentiment analysis. But this paper tests Auto-Instruct on 118 tasks from SuperNI and BBH representing complex NLP tasks. The impressive performance demonstrates strong generalizability.

- This is the first work I'm aware of that evaluates instruction optimization methods specifically under the true few-shot setting. Many prior methods required a validation set for instruction selection, which is not always available. The techniques in this paper address the limitations of low-resource scenarios.

- The analysis provides useful insights into LLM instability across instructions, effectiveness of the ranking model, the impact of training data size, and case studies showing how the selected instructions improve upon human-written ones. This sheds light on the inner workings of the approach.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions over related work by presenting a comprehensive pipeline tailored to few-shot learning, using more diverse instruction generation strategies, large-scale multi-task training of the ranking model, and extensive evaluation on complex benchmark tasks. The results demonstratestate-of-the-art performance and interpretability.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore integrating orthogonal techniques like demonstration selection and reasoning chain selection into the Auto-Instruct pipeline, to holistically optimize the entire LLM prompt.

- Investigate generating instructions for non-English languages and tasks. The current scope is limited to English instructions only. 

- Further diversify the generated instructions by automatically exploring different phrasings of the meta-prompts. The paper notes that the quality of generated instructions still depends on the phrasing of the meta-prompts used.

- Evaluate the approach on more complex tasks and instructions, beyond the current benchmarks. The paper leaves open the exploration with longer or more complicated instructions.

- Study generating instructions using recent open-source LLMs, as the paper finds they currently exhibit weaker abilities in following the meta-prompts compared to large proprietary models.

- Assess the benefits of incorporating even more training tasks, since Figure 5 indicates performance has not plateaued when using all available training tasks. More data could further improve generalizability.

- Explore transferring the approach to other modalities like vision, as the current focus is on language tasks.

In summary, the main suggested future work includes expanding the approach to more languages, tasks, and modalities; further diversifying the generated instructions; integrating with orthogonal prompt optimization techniques; and utilizing even more training data. The authors frame Auto-Instruct as an initial solution with much room left for improvement.

The paper introduces Auto-Instruct, a novel approach for automatically generating and selecting high-quality instructions for black-box language models. Instruction-tuned language models can perform a variety of NLP tasks by following natural language instructions, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, manually engineering effective instructions is laborious and suboptimal. 

Auto-Instruct first prompts the language model to generate a diverse set of candidate instructions using heuristics like specifying the instruction length or style. It then trains a model on hundreds of existing NLP tasks to score and select the most suitable instruction for each test example. Experiments demonstrate that Auto-Instruct outperforms both human-written and previous automatically generated instructions on 118 out-of-domain tasks. The approach exhibits strong generalizability by surpassing baselines when transferred to other language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. Overall, the paper presents a promising method to automate the instruction optimization process for black-box language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces Auto-Instruct, an automatic approach for generating and ranking instructions for black-box language models. The method first prompts the language model to generate a diverse set of candidate instructions for a given task, using a variety of meta-prompts to specify different styles (e.g. one sentence, step-by-step). It then trains an instruction ranking model on hundreds of existing NLP tasks, which learns to score the effectiveness of instructions based on the language model's downstream performance when prompted by them. For a new downstream task, this ranking model selects the most suitable instruction out of the candidate set for each test example. The selected instruction is then used to prompt the language model to make inferences for that example. Experiments demonstrate that Auto-Instruct is able to automatically create better instructions compared to both human-written ones and those generated by prior methods, as evaluated on a range of out-of-domain NLP benchmarks.
