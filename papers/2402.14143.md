# [SecurePose: Automated Face Blurring and Human Movement Kinematics   Extraction from Videos Recorded in Clinical Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14143)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sharing medical video data is important for research and clinical care, but faces must be blurred to protect patient privacy. 
- Manual blurring is extremely time-consuming. Existing automated face blurring methods are unreliable on real-world clinical videos, failing to blur all faces or blurring non-face regions.
- Blurring faces also reduces accuracy of automated pose estimation tools used to quantify movements, which are important for assessing disorders.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors developed SecurePose - an open source software with a graphical user interface for automated face blurring and body movement quantification.

- It uniquely identifies and tracks all people in a video, determines the patient, selectively blurs patient/non-patient faces, and extracts full body movement kinematics before blurring to maximize accuracy.

- Blurring uses detected face coordinates and dynamically estimated face sizes based on body proportions. The software allows checking and manually refining any blurring errors.  

Contributions:
- First software for automated, selective face blurring in clinical videos with manually verifiable performance.

- Enables extraction of accurate, patient-specific movement kinematics from pre-blurred videos.

- Validated on 116 real-world clinical videos achieving precision of 99.2\% and recall of 99\% in face detection vs manual blurring. 

- Matching performance to manual blurring with only 8.92\% of the human effort through additional quality checks.

- Easy to use for clinicians - scored 88.75/100 on the System Usability Scale user-test.

In summary, it is an automated and selective face blurring methodology to facilitate secure analysis of medical videos for research and clinical applications.
