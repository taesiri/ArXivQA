# [Financial Default Prediction via Motif-preserving Graph Neural Network   with Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of financial default prediction in online financial platforms. The goal is to predict whether a user will fail to make loan repayments in the future based on the user's profiles and graph-structured relationships with other users. However, existing methods have limitations in capturing informative signals from such graph data. Specifically, they only model lower-order connectivity patterns (e.g. direct edges between users), while overlooking higher-order patterns (e.g. triangular relationships) that provide critical signals. Moreover, they fail to address the issues of weak connectivity and unbalanced motif distributions in motif-based graphs.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel deep learning framework, MotifGNN, to model both lower and higher-order topology structures in social graphs for accurate default prediction. The key ideas include:

(1) Construct multi-view motif-based graphs to explicitly retain various high-order structures.
(2) Design a motif-based gating mechanism to address the weak connectivity issue in motif graphs by incorporating signals from the original graph. 
(3) Propose a curriculum learning approach to handle unbalanced motif patterns among users by focusing more on samples with uncommon distributions.

Main Contributions:
- First work to jointly model lower and higher-order social graph structures for financial default prediction.
- A motif-preserving GNN architecture with a gating design to effectively learn from motif graphs despite connectivity issues.
- A curriculum learning method to handle highly unbalanced motif patterns among users.
- Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on one public and two industrial datasets.

In summary, the paper presents a novel graph learning framework to overcome key limitations of existing works and provide an effective solution for social graph-based financial default prediction. The introduced techniques for handling challenges in motif-based learning are generalizable to other graph analysis tasks as well.
