# [The theoretical limits of biometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00019)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the theoretical limits of biometric systems for identification. Specifically, it analyzes the number of bits needed to store biometric templates in a database to avoid collisions between users, considering noise in the biometric data. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a theoretical analysis using an information-theoretic approach. It models biometric templates as arrays of random, uncorrelated bits following a Bernoulli distribution. This allows computing collision probabilities based on the birthday paradox. 

The analysis first considers an ideal noise-free scenario. It shows that the number of bits must grow as 2*log2(N) with the number of users N to prevent collisions. 

Then noise is added, modeled by a bit flip probability p. New expressions for user identification probability and overall collision probability are derived, considering both intra-user variability and inter-user distances. Approximations are provided to simplify computations.

With fixed noise and accuracy level, a linear relationship is empirically found between the log population size and number of bits. The slope and offset depend on noise level and target accuracy. This allows estimating storage needs.

An open-world setup is also analyzed with thresholds to reject non-enrolled users. Formulas for False Negative and False Positive Identification Rates are provided. Surprisingly, the open vs closed world setups have nearly identical storage requirements.

Main Contributions:
- Information-theoretic modeling of biometric collision avoidance problem 
- Analysis of noise impact on identification accuracy
- Simple bit estimate as a function of population size and noise to guarantee user distinction
- Numerical computations showing entire world's population templates can fit on a small disk
- Formulation and analysis of an open-world setup with unenrolled users

The analysis makes very simplistic assumptions but provides encouragement for developing large-scale identification systems. It also gives lower bounds on biometric storage needs under ideal conditions. Many research challenges remain to bridge the gap with practice.
