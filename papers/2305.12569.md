# [Conditional Generative Modeling is All You Need for Marked Temporal   Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12569)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is: How can we develop an effective and efficient model for generating high-quality, multi-dimensional event data that accurately captures complex temporal dynamics?The key hypotheses underlying their approach are:1) Marked temporal point processes can be modeled as conditional generative models without explicitly specifying the conditional intensity or probability density. 2) A conditional generator taking history as input can efficiently generate high-quality subsequent events likely to occur.3) This approach can overcome limitations of prior neural point process models in handling multi-dimensional events and provides exceptional flexibility and computational efficiency.In summary, the paper proposes using a conditional generative modeling framework for marked temporal point processes to efficiently generate multi-dimensional event data while capturing intricate temporal dynamics. Their central hypothesis is that this approach will outperform existing neural point process methods, especially for high-dimensional event data.
