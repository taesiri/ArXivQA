# [Influencing Bandits: Arm Selection for Preference Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Influencing Bandits: Arm Selection for Preference Shaping":

Problem:
The paper considers stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) used in recommendation systems. Typically, MAB algorithms assume user preferences are unaffected by the sequence of recommended items. However, in reality user preferences evolve over time based on the recommendations shown and rewards received. The paper studies this setting where user population preferences are reinforced positively or negatively by the observed rewards over time. The goal is to actively shape the population preferences, unlike typical MAB objectives of maximizing cumulative reward.

Proposed Solution:
The paper models the user population using an urn model that keeps track of preferences. It considers two models - decreasing influence dynamics (DID) where the population becomes more rigid over time, and constant influence dynamics (CID) where influence remains constant. For the DID model with 2 arms and types, it derives the optimal policy when the reward statistics are known. For unknown rewards, it proposes and analyzes two algorithms:

1) Explore-then-Commit: Explores uniformly initially to estimate rewards, then commits to optimal policy using the estimates. Provides logarithmic regret for a symmetric case. 

2) Thompson Sampling: Maintains Bayesian priors on rewards and samples estimated rewards in each round. Shows this also attains logarithmic regret, without needing time horizon.

It further shows the CID model leads to the same optimal policy and algorithm performance. Extensions consider an N arm/N type setting with optimal policy derivation and Thompson sampling algorithm. It also models competing recommendation systems and studies system popularity vs. preference shaping tradeoffs.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes preference shaping in non-stationary contextual bandits by modeling evolving user population through urn model
- Derives optimal policy for known system, and analyzes two practical algorithms for unknown system
- Guarantees logarithmic regret in cumulative type 1 population for the algorithms
- Extends modeling and algorithms to more complex scenarios of N arms/types and competing systems  

In summary, the paper provides a rigorous treatment of preference shaping in stochastic bandits, with practical algorithms and theoretical performance guarantees. The notion of shaping user preferences over time by a recommendation system is an important modern consideration.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops multi-armed bandit algorithms to actively influence user preferences over time by modeling how positive and negative rewards shape the population distribution across user types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing models and algorithms for influencing/shaping the preferences of a user population over time using a multi-armed bandit approach. Specifically:

- It models how the preferences of a user population evolve over time in response to the recommendations made by the system, considering both positive and negative reinforcements. Two dynamics are considered - decreasing influence over time and constant influence.

- For the decreasing influence case, it derives the optimal policy for maximizing a target population type when the reward statistics are known. It also proposes and analyzes Explore-then-Commit and Thompson Sampling based algorithms when the rewards are unknown. 

- It shows that the analysis extends to the constant influence case based on a voter model.

- It provides extensions for the multi-armed bandit setting with more than two arms and user types. 

- It also discusses modeling multiple competing recommendation systems and tradeoffs between popularity vs preference shaping goals.

In summary, the key contribution is in modeling and algorithms for actively influencing user preferences over time using a contextual bandit approach, which the paper notes has not been previously explored. The analysis and algorithms for both decreasing and constant influence cases are also significant contributions.

The paper considers the problem of shaping user preferences in a population using multi-armed bandit algorithms. It models the preferences using contextual bandits with non-stationary rewards, where the rewards positively or negatively reinforce preferences over time. Key models considered are decreasing elasticity (modeled via Polya urns) and constant elasticity (voter model). Algorithms analyzed include explore-then-commit policies and Thompson sampling, with regret bounds derived. Extensions cover the case of N arms and populations, as well as scenarios with multiple competing recommendation systems. Overall, the key focus is on actively influencing preferences over time in a bandit learning setting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in the paper:

1) How does the model handle exploration vs exploitation tradeoff when the recommendation system does not know the user preference matrix B initially? Does Thompson sampling provide an effective strategy here compared to other approaches?

2) The paper defines regret differently than the standard notion of regret in bandit problems. What is the justification behind this new definition of regret? How does it compare with the traditional definition? 

3) What are some real-world examples where the decreasing influence dynamics (DID) model would apply? Does the DID model capture the diminishing returns aspect accurately?

4) How can we extend the Thompson sampling algorithm to handle the case when there are more than two types of user opinions beyond just like and dislike feedback? 

5) What is the computational complexity of the proposed Thompson sampling algorithm? How does it scale when the number of arms or user types grows beyond 2?

6) Can we provide finite time performance guarantees or sample complexity bounds for the Thompson sampling algorithm proposed?

7) The paper handles two competing recommendation systems through simulations. Can we model this problem analytically? Are there game-theoretic aspects that could provide insights?

8) How robust is the explore-then-commit strategy to errors in estimating the time horizon T? Could an adaptive or anytime explore-then-commit algorithm work better?  

9) For the voter model dynamics, can we quantify the rate of convergence to the optimal proportions mathematically? How does it depend on the initialization and parameters?

10) The user type evolution currently depends only on the recommended arm. Could we model more complex opinion dynamics where peer influence also plays a role? How would the arm selection strategy change?
