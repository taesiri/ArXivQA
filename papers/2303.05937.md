# [Structural Multiplane Image: Bridging Neural View Synthesis and 3D   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05937)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The main research question this paper addresses is: How can we construct multiplane images that better adapt to scene geometry and provide improved view synthesis and 3D reconstruction compared to traditional multiplane images? Specifically, the key hypotheses are:1) By making the orientations and depth offsets of multiplane image layers flexible rather than fixed fronto-parallel planes, the representation can better approximate complex 3D scene geometry. This helps reduce discretization artifacts from slanted surfaces.2) Modeling non-planar regions with adaptive fronto-parallel planes rather than forcing small fragmented planes improves fidelity and reduces rendering costs. 3) Jointly optimizing for view synthesis and planar estimation during training improves both tasks compared to addressing them separately.4) For multi-view inputs, using global proxy embeddings that represent the full 3D scene extent helps ensure consistency and provides better supervision.5) The proposed end-to-end transformer network can effectively construct such structural multiplane images (S-MPIs) and achieve improved performance on view synthesis and 3D planar reconstruction.In summary, the central hypothesis is that scene-adaptive multiplane images with both flexibly-oriented planes and adaptive non-planar layers can better represent 3D geometry while also enabling high quality view synthesis. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed S-MPI representation and transformer-based construction method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing the Structural Multiplane Image (S-MPI) representation, which consists of geometrically-faithful RGBÎ± images approximating the 3D scene geometry. This aims to overcome limitations of standard MPI like discretization artifacts and redundant layers. 2. Proposing an end-to-end transformer-based network to construct the S-MPI, where planar and non-planar regions are handled in a unified framework with high fidelity geometric and appearance modeling.3. Ensuring multi-view consistency for S-MPI construction, by using global proxy embeddings that encode plane features covering the full 3D scene extent. These embeddings evolve under supervision from multiple views.4. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and planar reconstruction tasks for indoor scenes, outperforming prior MPI methods. The model also shows encouraging results compared to NeRF given sparse views, while being significantly faster.In summary, the key contribution is introducing the S-MPI representation and a learning framework to construct it from images, advancing both view synthesis and 3D modeling compared to prior scene representations. The global proxy embeddings are a key novelty for consistent multi-view modeling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the main point of the paper:The paper proposes Structural Multiplane Images (S-MPI), an explicit 3D scene representation for neural view synthesis that uses geometrically accurate planes to overcome limitations like discretization artifacts and redundant textures in standard Multiplane Images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related works in the field of neural view synthesis and 3D reconstruction:1. Compared to NeRF-based view synthesis methods, this paper proposes the Structural MPI (S-MPI) representation which is more efficient to render novel views while achieving competitive quality. NeRF methods like mNeRF require per-scene optimization and are slow to render.2. Compared to standard MPI representations, S-MPI uses geometrically adaptive planes rather than fronto-parallel planes only. This allows it to better represent slanted surfaces and avoid discretization artifacts. 3. For 3D reconstruction, S-MPI jointly handles planar and non-planar regions in a unified framework. Prior plane-based reconstruction methods like PlaneRCNN often neglect non-planar areas. 4. For multi-view input, S-MPI uses global proxy embeddings to achieve direct alignment of planes across views. Other plane detection works rely on expensive post-matching of independently detected planes.5. Experiments show S-MPI outperforms previous MPI methods on view synthesis and plane-based methods on reconstruction. It also approaches NeRF quality much faster.In summary, this paper proposes a novel S-MPI representation that elegantly combines the advantages of MPI-based view synthesis and plane-based reconstruction in a jointly optimized framework. The global proxy design is an innovative way to achieve multi-view consistency.
