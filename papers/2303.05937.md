# [Structural Multiplane Image: Bridging Neural View Synthesis and 3D   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05937)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The main research question this paper addresses is: How can we construct multiplane images that better adapt to scene geometry and provide improved view synthesis and 3D reconstruction compared to traditional multiplane images? Specifically, the key hypotheses are:1) By making the orientations and depth offsets of multiplane image layers flexible rather than fixed fronto-parallel planes, the representation can better approximate complex 3D scene geometry. This helps reduce discretization artifacts from slanted surfaces.2) Modeling non-planar regions with adaptive fronto-parallel planes rather than forcing small fragmented planes improves fidelity and reduces rendering costs. 3) Jointly optimizing for view synthesis and planar estimation during training improves both tasks compared to addressing them separately.4) For multi-view inputs, using global proxy embeddings that represent the full 3D scene extent helps ensure consistency and provides better supervision.5) The proposed end-to-end transformer network can effectively construct such structural multiplane images (S-MPIs) and achieve improved performance on view synthesis and 3D planar reconstruction.In summary, the central hypothesis is that scene-adaptive multiplane images with both flexibly-oriented planes and adaptive non-planar layers can better represent 3D geometry while also enabling high quality view synthesis. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed S-MPI representation and transformer-based construction method.
