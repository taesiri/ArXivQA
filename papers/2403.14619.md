# [ClusteringSDF: Self-Organized Neural Implicit Surfaces for 3D   Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14619)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Contemporary 3D scene understanding approaches face two key limitations: (1) Large-scale 3D annotated data is not readily available, making 3D decomposition/segmentation challenging. (2) While 2D segmentation has seen improvements, fusing these inconsistent 2D segments from multiple views into a coherent 3D representation remains an open challenge. 

Proposed Solution - ClusteringSDF:
This paper proposes ClusteringSDF, a novel approach to achieve both 3D reconstruction and decomposition via neural implicit surfaces. It replaces the ground-truth supervision of prior works with a clustering method to align inconsistent 2D instance/semantic labels from pre-trained models. 

Key ideas:
(1) Treat the predicted SDF probabilities for each ray as features and bring distributions belonging to the same object closer while separating those from different objects. Cluster assignment is based on 2D labels in each view.
(2) Propose a differentiation loss to push clustering centers apart and one-hot+regularization losses to encourage one-hot assignments. 
(3) Further losses to match semantic labels, distinguish foreground vs background, and a multi-view loss.

Main Contributions:
(1) A self-organized approach to lift 2D segments to 3D using clustering while enabling joint reconstruction.
(2) A highly efficient clustering method that constraints centers to a simplex and alignment without computing pixel similarities.
(3) Maintains object-compositional representations without ground-truth labels. 

Experiments show ClusteringSDF outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on ScanNet and Replica datasets while being 4x faster to train. It also shows strong qualitative segmentation and object surface reconstruction results.
