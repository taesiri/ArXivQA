# [auto-sktime: Automated Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08528)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time series forecasting is crucial for decision making in various sectors, but creating accurate forecasting models is challenging due to the proliferation of diverse time series data and expanding landscape of forecasting methods. 
- There is a growing need for efficient frameworks that can automate the entire forecasting pipeline to enable easy deployment.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes auto-sktime, a novel Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) framework for end-to-end time series forecasting. 
- It leverages Bayesian Optimization to automatically construct pipelines with statistical, ML and DNN models tuned to the given time series data.

Main Contributions:
1. A templating method to generate pipelines tailored to different types of time series data (univariate, multivariate, panel data etc.)
2. A technique to warm-start optimization using priors extracted from previous optimizations on similar time series.
3. A multi-fidelity budget approach specific to time series data that approximates longer series with shorter subsequences.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on 64 real-world time series datasets from diverse domains.
- Significantly outperforms AutoML frameworks like Auto-PyTorch, AutoGluon etc. as well as statistical and DNN baselines.
- Ablation studies validate that all three proposed techniques improve optimization efficiency.

To summarize, the paper presents auto-sktime, a novel AutoML solution that automates time series forecasting pipelines. It adapts existing AutoML methods like Bayesian Optimization for time series data using techniques like warm starting and multi-fidelity approximations. Experiments show improved accuracy and efficiency over other frameworks.
