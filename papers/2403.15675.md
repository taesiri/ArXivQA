# [An active learning model to classify animal species in Hong Kong](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Camera traps generate large amounts of ecological data but manually labeling images is time consuming. 
- Existing deep learning models for automated image classification have limited generalizability when applied to new datasets.
- Collecting sufficient labeled training data for deep learning is difficult.

Proposed Solution:  
- Develop a deep learning workflow to classify animals detected in camera trap images from Hong Kong.
- Use transfer learning with a ResNet50 model pre-trained on ImageNet then fine-tune on Hong Kong camera trap data.  
- Implement an active learning approach to efficiently improve model accuracy with minimal additional labeling.

Key Outcomes:
- Built an automated species classification pipeline using MegaDetector and deep learning.
- Achieved 89% accuracy on test data using transfer learning with limited labels.  
- Improved generalizability through active learning, reaching 94.1% accuracy on an independent Hong Kong dataset.
- Demonstrated workflow for rapidly developing location-specific classifiers with minimal labeling.

Main Contributions:
- An accurate and generalizable automated species classification model for camera trap images from Hong Kong.
- A workflow for efficiently building deep learning classifiers with limited training data.
- Performance analysis demonstrating the viability of transfer learning and active learning for this application.

In summary, the authors have presented an effective pipeline to develop automated species classifiers for camera trap data by combining transfer learning and active learning. The accuracy and generalizability achieved highlights this as a valuable approach for reducing the costs of working with ecological image data.
