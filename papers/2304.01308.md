# [Role of Transients in Two-Bounce Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01308)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is:

How can using time-of-flight (ToF) information and transient measurements enable snapshot capture and 3D reconstruction in two-bounce non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging? 

The key ideas and contributions seem to be:

- Proposing the use of two-bounce transient measurements for NLOS imaging. This allows the use of multiplexed illumination to reduce the number of required measurements.

- Analyzing the tradeoffs between spatial resolution, temporal resolution, number of measurements, and recoverability metrics like SNR and mutual coherence. 

- Showing through simulations and experiments that ToF information enables reconstruction of occluded objects using fewer measurements than intensity-only methods. Even with high levels of illumination multiplexing, transients allow disambiguation of shadows.

- Providing insights into two-bounce lidar for NLOS and laying groundwork for future snapshot NLOS imaging systems as ToF sensors improve.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that two-bounce transient measurements can unlock snapshot NLOS imaging by enabling disambiguation of shadows even with high levels of multiplexed illumination. The experiments and analysis aim to validate this idea and provide guidance for system design.
